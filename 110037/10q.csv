Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summa ry of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Consolidation: Ponce Financial Group, Inc. (hereafter referred to as “we,” “our,” “us,” “Ponce Financial Group, Inc.,” or the “Company”) is the holding company of Ponce Bank (“Ponce Bank” or the “Bank”), a federally chartered stock savings association. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary Ponce Bank (the “Bank”) and the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Ponce De Leon Mortgage Corp., which is a mortgage banking entity. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Nature of Operations: The Company is a savings and loan holding company. The Company is subject to the regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Company’s business is conducted through the administrative office and 13 full service banking and 6 mortgage loan offices. The banking offices are located in New York City – the Bronx ( 4 branches), Queens ( 3 branches), Brooklyn ( 3 branches), Manhattan ( 2 branches) and Union City ( 1 branch), New Jersey. The mortgage loan offices are located in Queens ( 4 ) and Brooklyn ( 1 ), New York and Bergenfield ( 1 ), New Jersey. The Company’s primary market area currently consists of the New York City metropolitan area. The Bank is a federally chartered stock savings association headquartered in the Bronx, New York. It was originally chartered in 1960 as a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association under the name Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1985, the Bank changed its name to “Ponce De Leon Federal Savings Bank.” In 1997, the Bank changed its name again to “Ponce De Leon Federal Bank.” Upon the completion of its reorganization into a mutual holding company structure in September of 2017, the assets and liabilities of Ponce De Leon Federal Bank were transferred to and assumed by the Bank. The Bank is a Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), a Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”), and a certified Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lender. The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). The Bank’s business primarily consists of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in mortgage loans, consisting of one-to-four family residential (both investor-owned and owner-occupied), multifamily residential, nonresidential properties and construction and land, and, to a lesser extent, in business and consumer loans. The Bank also invests in securities, which have historically consisted of U.S. government and federal agency securities and securities issued by government-sponsored or owned enterprises, mortgage-backed securities and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the “FHLBNY”) stock. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts, including demand, savings, money markets and certificates of deposit accounts. Risks and Uncertainties: Inflation and interest rates may continue to adversely impact several industries within our geographic footprint and impair the ability of the Company’s customers to fulfill their contractual obligations to the Company. This could cause the Company to experience adverse effects on its business operations, loan portfolio, financial condition, and results of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, total interest expenses increased $ 35.5 million , or 480.4 % , to $ 42.8 million when compared to $ 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Use of Estimates : In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, the valuation of loans held for sale, the valuation of deferred tax assets and investment securities and the estimates relating to the valuation for share-based awards. Interim Financial Statements : The interim consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2023, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 are unaudited and reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months 6 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) ended September 30, 2023 , are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2023, or any other period. Significant Group Concentrations of Credit Risk : Most of the Bank's activities are with customers located within New York City. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the Bank's loan portfolio and the ability of Mortgage World, a division of the Bank, to sell originated loans in the secondary markets are susceptible to changes in the local market conditions. Note 3 discusses the types of securities in which the Bank invests. Notes 5 and 13 discuss the types of lending that the Bank engages in, and other concentrations. Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts due from banks (including items in process of clearing). For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash flows from loans originated by the Company, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions, and deposits are reported net. Included in cash and cash equivalents are restricted cash from escrows and good faith deposits. Escrows consist of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) upfront mortgage insurance premiums and escrows on unsold mortgages that are held on behalf of borrowers. Good faith deposits consist of deposits received from commercial loan customers for use in various disbursements relating to the closing of a commercial loan. Securities : Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the date individual investment securities are acquired, and the appropriateness of such classification is reassessed at each statement of financial condition date. Debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as ""held-to-maturity"" and recorded at amortized cost. Trading securities, if any, are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings. Securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading, are classified as ""available-for-sale"" and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. Held-to maturity securities : Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Topic 326, ""Financial Instruments - Credit Losses"" which replaced the previously existing U.S. GAAP ""incurred loss"" approach to ""expected credit losses"" approach, which is referred as Current Expected Credit Losses (""CECL""). CECL modifies the accounting of impairment on held-for-sale debt securities by recognizing a credit loss through an allowance for credit losses. The Company methodology to measure the allowance for credit loss (""ACL"") incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information to assess lifetime expected credit losses at the portfolio level. The quantitative component includes the calculation of loss rates using an open pool method. The Company differentiates its loss-rate method for a pool of held-to-maturity corporate securities by looking to publicly available historical default and recovery statistics based on the attributes of issuer type, rating category and time to maturity. The Company measures expected credit losses of these financial assets by applying loss rates to the amortized cost basis of each asset taking into consideration amortization, prepayment and default assumptions. The Company considers qualitative adjustments to expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. Qualitative factor adjustments may increase or decrease management's estimate of expected credit losses. Adjustments will not be made for information that has already been considered and included in the quantitative allowance. Available-for-sale securities : The impairment model for available-for-sale (""AFS"") debt securities differs from the CECL approach utilized by held-to-maturity (""HTM"") debt securities since AFS debt securities are measured at fair value rather than amortized cost. For AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Bank first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. 7 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the available-for-sale securities for impairment. Securities that are in an unrealized loss position are reviewed to determine if a securities credit loss exists based on certain quantitative and qualitative factors. The primary factors considered in evaluating whether an impairment exists include: (a) the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, (b) the financial condition, credit rating and future prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, and (d) whether the Company intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not the Company will not be required to sell the security. If a determination is made that a security is impaired, the Company will estimate the amount of the unrealized loss that is attributable to credit and all other non-credit related factors. The credit related component will be recognized as a securities credit loss as a provision expense through the establishment of an allowance for available for sale securities. The securities credit loss expense will be limited to the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and fair value and any future changes may be reversed, limited to the amount previously expensed in the period they occur. The non-credit related component will be recorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The evaluation of securities for impairment is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the estimated fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include change in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition and/or future prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads, and the expected recovery period. See Note 3 (""Securities"") of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock : The Bank is a member of the FHLBNY. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. FHLBNY stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. Loans Receivable : Loans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at current unpaid principal balances, net of the allowance for credit losses on loans and including net deferred loan origination fees and costs. Interest income is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the interest method without anticipating prepayments. A loan is moved to nonaccrual status in accordance with the Company’s policy typically after 90 days of non-payment. The accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is generally discontinued at the time the loan becomes 90 days past due unless the loan is well-secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than 90 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All nonaccrual loans are considered impaired loans. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual are reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash basis or recorded against principal balances, until qualifying for return to accrual. Cash basis interest recognition is only applied on nonaccrual loans with a sufficient collateral margin to ensure no doubt with respect to the collectability of principal. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and remain current for a period of time (typically six months) and future payments are reasonably assured. Accrued interest receivable is closely monitored for collectability and will be charged-off in a timely manner if deemed uncollectable. In the event that collection of principal becomes uncertain, the Company has policies in place to write-off accrued interest receivable by reversing interest income in a timely manner. Therefore, the Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis and therefore excludes it from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”). Allowance for Credit Losses : The ACL on loans is management's estimate of expected credit losses over the expected life of the loans at the reporting date. The ACL on loans is increased through a provision for credit losses (“PCL”) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and by recoveries of amounts previously charged off. The ACL on loans is reduced by charge-offs on loans. Loan charge-offs are recognized when Management believes the collectability of the principal balance outstanding is unlikely. Full or partial charge-offs on collateral-dependent individually analyzed loans are generally recognized when the collateral is deemed to be insufficient to support the carrying value of the loan. According to ASC 326-20-30-9, estimating expected credit losses is highly judgmental and generally will require Ponce Bank to make specific judgments. One of these specific judgments around how Ponce Bank will make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts of expected credit losses. Ponce Bank uses Federal Open Market Committee to obtain various forecasts for unemployment rate, national gross domestic product and the National Consumer Price Index. Ponce Bank has elected to forecast the first four quarters of the credit loss estimate and revert to a long-run average of each considered economic factor as permitted in ASC 326-20-30-9. 8 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The level of the ACL on loans is based on Management's ongoing review of all relevant information, from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions and reasonable forecast. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for calculation of probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default and the estimation of expected credit losses. As discussed further below, adjustments to historical information are made for differences in specific risk characteristics, such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term, as well as for changes in environmental conditions, that may not be reflected in historical loss rates. Management employs a process and methodology to estimate the ACL on loans that evaluates both quantitative and qualitative factors. Under ASC 326-20-30-2 and 326-20-55-5, Ponce Bank should aggregate financial assets on the basis of similar risk characteristics. Management selected a Call Code segmentation, as based on the Bank's call report. Management’s criteria for determining an appropriate segmentation (1) groups loans based on similar risk characteristics; (2) allows for mapping and utilization/application of publicly available external information (Call Report Filings); (3) allows for mapping and utilization/application of publicly available external information; (4) federal call code is granular enough to accommodate enough to accommodate a “like-kind” notion, yet broad enough to maintain statistical relevance and/or a meaningful number of loan observations within material segments and (5) federal call code designation is identifiable throughout historical data sets, which is critical component of segmentation selection. Quantitative loss factors are also supplemented by certain qualitative risk factors reflecting Management's view of how losses may vary from those represented by quantitative loss rates. These qualitative risk factors include: (1) changes in lending policies, procedures and strategies including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses; (2) economic conditions such as the Bank’s market area, customer demographics, portfolio composition, along with national indicators considered impactful to the model; (3) changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio; (4) credit and lending staff/administration; (5) problem with loan trends; (6) concentrations; (7) loan review results; (8) collateral values and regulatory and business environment. Because the methodology is based upon historical experience and trends, current economic data, reasonable and supportable forecasts, as well as Management's judgment, factors may arise that result in different estimations. Deteriorating conditions or assumptions could lead to further increases in the ACL on loans. The ACL on loans is determined by an estimate of future credit losses, and ultimate losses may vary from Management's estimate. Allowances for Credit Losses on Unfunded Commitments : The ACL on unfunded commitments is Management's estimate of expected credit losses over the expected credit losses over the expected contractual term (or life) in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditional cancellable by the Company. For each portfolio, estimated loss rates and funding factors are applied to the corresponding balance of unfunded commitments and the estimated loss rates applied to unfunded commitments are the same quantitative and qualitative loss rates applied to the corresponding on-balance sheet amounts in determining the ACL on loans. The estimated funding factor applied to unfunded commitments represents the likelihood that the funding will occur and is based upon the Company's average historical utilization rate each portfolio. The ACL on unfunded commitments in included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Conditions. The ACL on unfunded commitments is adjusted through non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value : Loans held for sale, at fair value, include residential mortgages that were originated in accordance with secondary market pricing and underwriting standards. These loans are loans originated by the Bank’s Mortgage World division and the Company intends to sell these loans on the secondary market. Loans held for sale are carried at fair value under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. The gains or losses for the changes in fair value of these loans are included in income on sale of loans on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale measured under the fair value option is calculated based on the principal amount of the loan and is included in interest loans receivable on the consolidated statements of operations. At September 30, 2023 and at December 31, 2022 , 19 loans and 4 loans in the amount of $ 14.1 million and $ 2.0 million, respectively, were held for sale and accounted for under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The Company’s revenue from contracts with customers in the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contract with Customers , is recognized within noninterest income. ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Management determined the revenue streams impacted by ASC 606 included those related to service charges on deposit accounts, ATM and card fees and other services fees. The Company’s revenue recognition pattern for these revenue streams did not change from current practice. The Company's primary sources of revenue are interest income on financial assets and income from mortgage banking activities, which are explicitly excluded from the scope of ASC 606. 9 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Transfers of Financial Assets : Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when all of the components meet the definition of a participating interest and when control over the assets has been surrendered. A participating interest generally represents (1) a proportionate (pro rata) ownership interest in an entire financial asset, (2) a relationship where from the date of transfer all cash flows received from the entire financial asset are divided proportionately among the participating interest holders in an amount equal to their share of ownership, (3) the priority of cash flows has certain characteristics, including no reduction in priority, subordination of interest, or recourse to the transferor other than standard representation or warranties, and (4) no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Bank, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Bank does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either (a) an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity or (b) the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a clean-up call. Premises and Equipment : Premises include the cost of land and buildings actually owned and occupied (or to be occupied) by the Bank, its branches, or consolidated subsidiaries. Equipment includes all movable furniture, fixtures, and equipment, including automobiles and other vehicles of the Bank, its branches and consolidated subsidiaries. Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is the concept of allocating the cost of fixed assets over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed and charged to operations using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows: Years Buildings 39 Building improvements 15 - 39 Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 3 - 10 Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated economic lives or the related lease terms, including extensions expected to be exercised. Gains and losses on dispositions are recognized upon realization. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and improvements are capitalized. Leasehold improvements in process are not amortized until the assets are placed in operation. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets : Long-lived assets, including premises and leasehold improvements, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated by that review, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to noninterest expense. Leases : The Company leases office space and certain equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements and determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company does not currently have any financing lease arrangements. Right of use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right of use assets are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term adjusted for initial direct costs, if any, and lease incentives received or deemed probable of being received. The Company uses the rate implicit in the lease if it is readily determinable or otherwise the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The implicit rates of Company leases are not readily determinable and accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date for all leases. The Company's incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms and in a similar economic environment. The Company uses its FHLBNY borrowing rate based on the information available on the commencement date plus a spread of 2.50 % in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in “Occupancy and equipment” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Some of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation which are accounted for as variable lease amounts but are not reflected as a component of the Company’s lease liability. Certain leases also require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises or equipment which are also not reflected as a component of the Company’s lease liability Other Real Estate Owned : Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) represents properties acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure or other proceedings. OREO is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated disposal costs, at the date of foreclosure, which establishes a new cost basis. After foreclosure, the properties are held for sale and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs of disposal. Any write-down to fair value, at the time of transfer to OREO, is charged to the allowance for credit losses. 10 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Properties are evaluated regularly to ensure that the recorded amounts are supported by current fair values and charges against earnings are recorded as necessary to reduce the carrying amount to fair value, less estimated costs to dispose. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property are capitalized, subject to the limit of fair value of the OREO, while costs relating to holding the property are expensed. Gains or losses are included in operations upon disposal. Income Taxes : The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income, in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 % likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, would be classified as additional provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. Related Party Transactions : Directors and officers of the Company and their affiliates have been customers of and have had transactions with the Company, and it is expected that such persons will continue to have such transactions in the future. Management believes that all deposit accounts, loans, services and commitments comprising such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other customers who are not directors or officers. In the opinion of management, the transactions with related parties did not involve more than normal risk of collectability, nor favored treatment or terms, nor present other unfavorable features. Note 17 contains details regarding related party transactions. Employee Benefit Plans: The Company maintains a KSOP, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) provisions incorporated, a Long-Term Incentive Plan that includes grants of restricted stock units and stock options, and a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”). KSOP, the Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions: Compensation expense is recorded as shares are committed to be released with a corresponding credit to unearned KSOP equity account at the average fair market value of the shares during the period and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the service period based upon management’s estimate of the number of shares expected to be allocated by the KSOP. The difference between the average fair market value and the cost of the shares allocated by the KSOP is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in-capital. Unallocated common shares held by the Company’s KSOP are shown as a reduction in stockholders’ equity and are excluded from weighted-average common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted earnings per share calculations until they are committed to be released. The 401(k) provisions provide for elective employee/participant deferrals of income. Discretionary matching, profit-sharing, and safe harbor contributions, not to exceed 4 % of employee compensation and profit-sharing contributions may be provided. Stock Options: The Company recognizes the value of shared-based payment transactions as compensation costs in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. The fair value of the share-based payments for 11 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur during the period. Restricted Stock Units: The Company recognizes compensation cost related to restricted stock units based on the market price of the stock units at the grant date over the vesting period. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determines the fair value of restricted stock units. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Comprehensive Income (Loss): Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss), which are both recognized as separate components of stockholder’s equity. Other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale. Loss Contingencies : Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are any such matters that will have a material effect on the operations and financial position of the Company. Fair Value of Financial Instruments : Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in Note 14. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates. Segment Reporting : Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the “CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment and one reportable segment. Loan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments : Financial instruments include off‑balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. Earnings (Loss) per Share (“EPS”) : Basic EPS represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding, plus the effect of potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Basic weighted common shares outstanding is weighted average common shares outstanding less weighted average unallocated ESOP shares. Treasury Stock : Shares repurchased under the Company’s share repurchase programs were purchased in open-market transactions and are held as treasury stock. The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of stockholders’ equity. Reclassification of Prior Periods Presentation : Certain prior periods amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reporting results of operations and did not affect previously reported amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Deposits (Note 8) for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 for details on the reclassification. CDFI Equitable Recovery Program : On September 26, 2023, the Bank received a $ 3.7 million grant from the U.S. Treasury as part of the Community Development Financial Institutions (""CDFI"") Equitable Recovery Program (""ERP"") which aims to help CDFI's further their mission of helping low and low-to-moderate income communities recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 12 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted: In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) . ” This ASU provides optional means and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or other reference rates expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU were initially effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, ""Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date (Topic 848) . "" This ASU extends the sunset (or expiration) date of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 848 to December 31, 2024. This gives reporting entities two additional years to apply the accounting relief provided under ASC Topic 848 for matters related to reference rate reform. ASU 2022-06 is effective for all reporting entities immediately upon issuance and must be applied on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Note 2. Preferred Stock Issuance; Plan of Conversion and Stock Offering Preferred Stock Issuance On June 7, 2022, the Company‎ closed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 225,000 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A‎, par value $ 0.01 (the “Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price equal to $ 225.0 million in cash, to the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) pursuant to the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”).‎ The holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a dividend payable in cash quarterly at an annual rate dependent on certain factors as reported by the Company to Treasury in a quarterly supplemental report. The initial dividend rate is zero percent for the first two years after issuance, and thereafter the floor dividend rate is 0.50 % and the ceiling dividend rate is 2.00 %. After 10 years of issuance, the perpetual dividend rate in effect, will be determined based on said floor and ceiling. The actual dividend rate that will be paid by the Company on the Preferred Stock cannot be determined at this time. The ECIP investment by the Treasury is part of a program to invest over $ 8.7 billion into Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) or ‎Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), of which Ponce Bank is both. The ECIP is intended to incentivize CDFIs and MDIs to provide loans, grants, ‎and forbearance to small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers in low-income and underserved communities that may have been ‎disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.‎ In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $ 1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. Conversion, Reorganization and Common Stock Offering On May 25, 2021, Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company and PDL Community Bancorp, the then holding company for Ponce Bank and Mortgage World Bankers, Inc., announced that their Boards of Directors had unanimously adopted a Plan of Conversion and Reorganization (the “Plan”) pursuant to which Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company and PDL Community Bancorp reorganized into a new stock holding company and conducted a second-step stock offering of new shares of common stock. On January 26, 2022, Mortgage World transferred its assets and liabilities to Ponce Bank and ceased operating as an independent mortgage banking entity. Mortgage World’s business is now conducted as a division of Ponce Bank. On January 27, 2022, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and PDL Community Bancorp announced that the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from the mutual to stock form of organization and related stock offering was consummated at the close of business. As a result of the closing of the conversion and reorganization and stock offering, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. is now the holding company for Ponce Bank. Ponce Bank’s former mutual holding companies, PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, have ceased to exist. PDL Community Bancorp’s stock ceased trading at the close of the market on January 27, 2022. Ponce Financial Group, Inc.’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the same trading symbol “PDLB” on January 28, 2022. As a result of the conversion and reorganization, each issued and outstanding share of PDL Community Bancorp common stock was converted into the right to receive 1.3952 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. Cash was paid in lieu of any fractional shares based on the sale price in the offering of $ 10.00 per share. Ponce Financial Group Inc.’s total issued and outstanding shares on January 28, 2022 was 24,711,834 shares. All shares of treasury stock of PDL Community Bancorp were eliminated on January 27, 2022. 13 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) On January 27, 2022, the Company made a $ 5.0 million in contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation as part of the conversion and reorganization, which is included in the non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Note 3. Securities Adoption of Topic 326 Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the provisions of Topic 326 using the modified retrospective method.

Management reviewed the financial condition of the entities underlying the securities at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The unrealized losses related to the Company debt securities were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies. The Company does not believe that the debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2023 represents a credit loss impairment. The gross unrealized loss positions related to mortgage-backed securities and other obligations issued by the 16 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. Total gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities. Management reviewed the collectability of the corporate bonds taking into consideration of such factors as the financial condition of the issuers, reported regulatory capital ratios of the issuers, credit ratings, including ratings in effect as of the reporting date. Management believes the unrealized losses on the corporate bonds are primarily attributable to changes in the interest rates and not changes in the credit quality of the issuers of the corporate bonds. The following is a summary of maturities of securities at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Amounts are shown by contractual maturity.

The Company primarily grants loans secured by real estate to individuals and businesses pursuant to an established credit policy applicable to each type of lending activity in which it engages. Although collateral provides assurance as a secondary source of repayment, the Company ordinarily requires the primary source of repayment to be based on the borrowers’ ability to generate continuing cash flows. The Company also evaluates the collateral and creditworthiness of each customer. The credit policy provides that depending on the borrowers’ creditworthiness and type of collateral, credit may be extended up to predetermined percentages of the market value of the collateral or on an unsecured basis. Real estate is the primary form of collateral. Other important forms of collateral are time deposits and marketable securities. For disclosures related to the allowance for credit losses and credit quality, the Company does not have any disaggregated classes of loans below the segment level. Credit-Quality Indicators : Internally assigned risk ratings are used as credit-quality indicators, which are reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. The objectives of the Company’s risk-rating system are to provide the Board of Directors and senior management with an objective assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio, to promptly and accurately identify loans with well-defined credit weaknesses so that timely action can be taken to minimize credit loss, to identify relevant trends affecting the collectability of the loan portfolio, to isolate potential problem areas and to provide essential information for determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Below are the definitions of the internally assigned risk ratings: 20 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Loans within the top four categories above are considered pass rated, as commonly defined. Risk ratings are assigned as necessary to differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised to reflect changes in the borrowers’ financial condition and outlook, debt service coverage capability, repayment performance, collateral value and coverage as well as other considerations.

current information and events indicate all amounts due may not be collectable according to the contractual terms of the related loan agreements. Impaired loans are identified by applying normal loan review procedures in accordance with the allowance for credit losses methodology. Management periodically assesses loans to determine whether impairment exists. Any loan that is, or will potentially be, no longer performing in accordance with the terms of the original loan contract is evaluated to determine impairment. 24 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following information relates to impaired loans as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022: Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized As of and For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on a Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential $ 2,517 $ 2,081 $ 449 $ 2,530 $ 71 $ 6,478 $ 40 Multifamily residential — — — — — 958 — Nonresidential properties — — — — — 531 — Construction and land 6,650 6,657 — 6,657 — 8,438 — Nonmortgage loans: Business 209 — 209 209 204 83 — Consumer — — — — — — Total $ 9,376 $ 8,738 $ 658 $ 9,396 $ 275 $ 16,488 $ 40 Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized As of and For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on a Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential $ 13,100 $ 11,015 $ 1,777 $ 12,792 $ 168 $ 11,440 $ 164 Multifamily residential — — — — — 789 — Nonresidential properties 1,630 1,239 348 1,587 37 2,268 38 Construction and land 10,660 10,660 — 10,660 — 5,147 16 Nonmortgage loans: Business 359 359 — 359 — 93 — Consumer — — — — — 24 — Total $ 25,749 $ 23,273 $ 2,125 $ 25,398 $ 205 $ 19,761 $ 218 Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized As of and for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on a Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential $ 9,986 $ 7,827 $ 1,757 $ 9,584 $ 159 $ 11,072 $ 307 Multifamily residential — — — — — 630 — Nonresidential properties 843 457 344 801 37 1,930 30 Construction and land 7,567 7,567 — 7,567 — 6,408 — Nonmortgage loans: Business — — — — — 3 — Consumer — — — — — — — Total $ 18,396 $ 15,851 $ 2,101 $ 17,952 $ 196 $ 20,043 $ 337 The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-02 on January 1, 2023 . Since adoption, the Company has not modified any loans with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. These modifications may include a reduction in interest rate, an extension in term, principal forgiveness and/or other than insignificant payment delay. At September 30, 2023, there were no loans with modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, the Company classified certain loans as troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) loans when credit terms to a borrower in financial difficulty were modified, in accordance with ASC 310-40. With the adoption of ASU 25 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 2022-02 as of January 1, 2023, the Company has ceased to recognize or measure for new TDRs but those existing at December 31, 2022 will remain until settled. During the year ended December 31, 2022, there were no loans restructured as a troubled debt restructuring. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were 21 and 23 troubled debt restructured loans totaling $ 5.9 million and $ 6.6 million of which $ 5.2 million and $ 4.2 million are on accrual status, respectively. There were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. The financial impact from the concessions made represents specific impairment reserves on these loans, which aggregated to $ 0.2 million December 31, 2022. Write-off and write-down of Microloans In 2020, the Company entered into a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain. Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to $ 1,500 and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originates and services these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan is found to be fraudulent, becomes 90 days delinquent upon 90 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.” At December 31, 2022, the Bank had 27,886 Grain microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $ 18.2 million and which were performing, in management's opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by a $ 15.4 million allowance for loan losses, resulting in $ 2.8 million in Grain microloans, net of allowance for loan losses. Grain has been victimized by cyber fraud using synthetic and other forms of fraudulent identifications, a phenomenon that has become prevalent with Fintechs. Grain remains a pre-profit startup highly dependent on earnings from its relationship with the Bank, a new relationship with another financial institution, and further capital raises which may not materialize. The Company continues to closely monitor its portfolio of consumer loans originated by Grain as well as Grain’s refinement of solutions for detecting and preventing cyber fraud in the application for microloans. The Company has requested, and Grain has agreed, that no new microloans be originated until further notice and that further extensions of credit to an existing microloan borrower only be made upon confirmation that such borrower is not fraudulent. Further, like other start-up companies, there is a higher level of risk that Grain may not be able to execute its business plan and may fail. In the event Grain were to cease operations, and although it has considered contingency plans, the Bank may have greater difficulty in servicing and collecting the microloan portfolio. In such a case, the level the Bank has provided for in its allowance for credit losses for its microloan portfolio may be inadequate and it may need to increase its provision for credit losses, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. As a consequence of such events, the Bank may determine it appropriate to terminate its relationship with Grain. At September 30, 2023 , the Bank had 16,687 Grain microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $ 9.3 million and which were performing, in management’s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by an $ 8.1 million allowance for credit losses, resulting in $ 1.2 million in Grain microloans. Since the beginning of the Bank’s agreement with Grain and through September 30, 2023 , 45,322 microloans amounting to $ 24.3 million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain. The Company has written-down a total of $ 15.6 million, net of recoveries, of the Grain Receivable and received $ 6.8 million in cash from Grain and through the application of security deposits connected to fraudulent loan accounts. The Bank also opted to use the $ 1.8 million grant it received from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Rapid Response ‎Program to defray the Grain Receivable. The application of those amounts resulted in no net receivable. Additionally, the Company wrote-off its equity investment in Grain of $ 1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2023 , the Company’s total exposure to Grain was $ 1.2 million of the remaining microloans, net of allowance for credit losses, excluding $ 2.4 million of unused commitments available to Grain borrowers and $ 1.6 million of security deposits by Grain borrowers. The $ 1.3 million of recoveries for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the $ 18.5 million write-off for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 related to Grain is included in non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $ 1.3 million of recoveries for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, $ 0.7 million were payments received from Grain on the Grain Receivable and the remainder were payments from Grain borrowers. 26 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Grain Technology, Inc.

Excludes $ 1.6 million of security deposits by Grain originated borrowers reported in deposits in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Conditions. Off-Balance Sheet Credit Losses Also included within the scope of the CECL standard are off-balance sheet loan commitments, which includes the unfunded portion of committed lines of credit and construction loans. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the company is exposed to credit risk through a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The Company uses similar assumptions and risk factors that are developed for collectively evaluated financing receivables. This estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments to be funded over its estimated life. At September 30, 2023 , the allowance for off-balance sheet credit losses was $ 3.2 million, which is included in the ""Other liabilities"" on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company had $ 1.9 million in credit loss provision for off-balance-sheet items, which are included in ""Provision for contingencies"" on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Note 9. Borrowings The Bank had outstanding term advances from the FHLBNY and the FRBNY at September 30, 2023 and outstanding term advances from the FHLBNY at December 31, 2022, respectively. FHLBNY Advances : As a member of the FHLBNY, the Bank has the ability to borrow from the FHLBNY based on a certain percentage of the value of the Bank's qualified collateral, as defined in the FHLBNY Statement of Credit Policy, at the time of the borrowing. In accordance with an agreement with the FHLBNY, the qualified collateral must be free and clear of liens, pledges and encumbrances. The Bank had $ 371.1 million and $ 511.4 million of outstanding term advances from the FHLBNY at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively and $ 6.0 million of overnight line of credit advance from the FHLBNY at December 31, 2022.

Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 consists of the following: For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in thousands) Federal: Current $ 783 $ 2,265 $ 380 $ 370 Deferred 312 ( 2,750 ) 344 ( 4,047 ) 1,095 ( 485 ) 724 ( 3,677 ) State and local: Current 232 274 1,085 847 Deferred 1,818 ( 2,963 ) 1,091 ( 5,487 ) 2,050 ( 2,689 ) 2,176 ( 4,640 ) Valuation allowance ( 1,417 ) 2,354 ( 841 ) 4,061 Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 1,728 $ ( 820 ) $ 2,059 $ ( 4,256 ) Total income tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21 % for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to income before income taxes as a result of the following: For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in thousands) Income tax, at federal rate $ 906 $ ( 3,267 ) $ 1,027 $ ( 5,259 ) State and local tax, net of federal taxes 1,619 ( 2,125 ) 1,719 ( 3,666 ) Valuation allowance, net of the federal benefit ( 1,417 ) 2,354 ( 841 ) 4,061 Other 620 2,218 154 608 $ 1,728 $ ( 820 ) $ 2,059 $ ( 4,256 ) Management maintains a valuation allowance against its net New York State and New York City deferred tax assets as it is unlikely these deferred tax assets will be utilized to reduce the Company's tax liability in future years. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the valuation allowance decreased by $ 0.8 million and increased by $ 4.1 million, respectively. In 2022, the Company generated large net operating losses in New York State and New York City which in turn increased the 2022 valuation allowance. Management has determined that it is not required to establish a valuation allowance against any other deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully utilized in future periods. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers the scheduled reversal of the deferred tax liabilities, the level of historical taxable income, and the projected future taxable income over the periods that the temporary differences comprising the deferred tax assets will be deductible. For federal income tax purposes, a financial institution may carry net operating losses (“NOLs”) to forward tax years indefinitely. The use of NOLs to offset income is limited to 80 %. At September 30, 2023 , the Bank had a federal NOL carryforward of $ 6.7 million. The state and city of New York allow for a three-year carryback period and carryforward period of twenty years on NOLs generated on or after tax year 2015. For tax years prior to 2015, no carryback period is allowed. Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, has pre-2015 carryforwards of $ 0.6 million for New York State purposes and $ 0.5 million for New York City purposes. Furthermore, there are post-2015 carryforwards available of $ 58.9 million for New York State purposes and $ 29.7 million for New York City purposes. Finally, for New Jersey purposes, losses may only be carried forward 20 years, with no allowable carryback period. At September 30, 2023 , the Bank had a New Jersey NOL carryforward of $ 0.1 million. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits recorded.

Compensation and Benefit Plans Ponce Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions (the “KSOP”) . The KSOP is for eligible employees of Ponce Bank and those of its affiliates. The named executive officers are eligible to participate in the KSOP just like other employees. An employee must attain the age of 21 and will be eligible to participate in the 401(k) features of the KSOP in the quarter following thirty days of service and the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (""ESOP"") feature of the KSOP upon the first entry date commencing on or after the eligible employee’s completion of one year of service. Employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan at the beginning of each quarter (January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1). 401(k) Component : Under the 401(k) features of the KSOP (“401(k) Component”), a participant may elect to defer, on a pre-tax basis, the maximum amount as permitted by the Internal Revenue Code. For 2023, the salary deferral contribution limit was $ 22,500 ; provided, however, that a participant over age 50 may contribute an additional $ 7,500 to the 401(k) for a total of $ 30,000 . In addition to salary deferral contributions, Ponce Bank may make discretionary matching contributions, discretionary profit-sharing contributions or safe harbor contributions to the 401(k) Component. Discretionary matching contributions are allocated on the basis of salary deferral contributions. Discretionary profit-sharing contributions are based on three classifications set forth in the 401(k) feature (i) Class A — Chairman, President, and Executive Vice Presidents; (ii) Class B — Senior Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents and Assistant Vice Presidents; and (iii) Class C — all other eligible employees. The contribution for a class will be the same percentage of compensation for all participants in that class. If Ponce Bank decides to make a safe harbor contribution for a plan year, each participant will receive a contribution equal to 3 % of his or her compensation for the plan year. 32 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) A participant is always 100 % vested in his or her salary deferral contributions and safe harbor contributions. Discretionary matching and profit-sharing contributions are 20 % vested after two years of service, plus an additional 20 % for each additional year of service; so all participants are fully vested in such contributions after six years of service. Participants also will become fully vested in his or her account balance in the 401(k) Component automatically upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the KSOP. Generally, participants will receive distributions from the KSOP upon separation from service in accordance with the terms of the governing document. ESOP Component: On September 29, 2017, in connection with the Bank’s reorganization into the mutual holding company form of organization, the ESOP trustee purchased, on behalf of the ESOP, 723,751 shares of PDL Community Bancorp common stock. The ESOP funded its stock purchase with a loan (“First ESOP loan”) from PDL Community Bancorp in the amount of $ 7.2 million, which was equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The First ESOP loan is being repaid principally through Ponce Bank’s contributions to the ESOP over the 15 -year term of such loan. The interest rate for the First ESOP loan is 2.60 %. On January 27, 2022, concurrent with the completion of the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from a mutual form to a stock form of organization and the merger of PDL Community Bancorp with and into Ponce Financial Group, Inc., the shares of PDL Community Bancorp common stock held by the KSOP were converted into 977,880 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. On January 27, 2022, the KSOP trustee purchased, on behalf of the ESOP feature of the KSOP (“ESOP Component”), an additional 1,097,353 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock, or 4.44 % of the total number of shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock outstanding on January 27, 2022 (including shares issued to the Foundation). The KSOP funded this stock purchase with a loan (“Second ESOP loan”) from Ponce Financial Group, Inc. in the amount of $ 11.0 million, which was equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The Second ESOP loan is being repaid principally through Ponce Bank’s contributions to the ESOP Component over the 15 -year term of such loan. The interest rate for the Second ESOP loan is 1.82 %. The trustee of the trust funding the KSOP holds the shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock purchased by the KSOP in an unallocated suspense account, and shares will be released from the suspense account on a pro-rata basis as the loans are repaid. The trustee will allocate the shares released among participants on the basis of each participant’s proportional share of qualifying compensation relative to all participants participating in the ESOP Component. A participant will become 100 % vested in his or her account balance in the ESOP Component after three years of service. In addition, participants will become fully vested in his or her account balance in the ESOP Component automatically upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the KSOP. Generally, participants will receive distributions from the KSOP upon separation from service in accordance with the terms of the plan document. The KSOP reallocates any unvested shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock forfeited upon termination of employment among the remaining participants in the ESOP Component. Contributions to the ESOP are to be sufficient to pay principal and interest currently due under the loan agreement. Under applicable accounting requirements, Ponce Bank will record a compensation expense for the ESOP at the average market price of the shares as they are committed to be released from the unallocated suspense account to participants’ accounts, which may be more or less than the original issue price. The compensation expense resulting from the release of the common stock from the suspense account and allocation to plan participants will result in a corresponding reduction in the earnings of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. The ESOP shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations (see Note 12). As of September 30, 2023 , the combined outstanding balance of both the First ESOP loan and Second ESOP loan was $ 13.3 million. A summary of the ESOP shares as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows: September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Shares committed-to-be released 100,308 133,744 Shares allocated to participants 448,746 354,227 Unallocated shares 1,469,167 1,569,475 Total 2,018,221 2,057,446 Fair value of unallocated shares $ 11,489 $ 14,628 The Company recognized ESOP related compensation expense, including ESOP equalization expense, of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , and $ 0.9 million and $ 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 33 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan: The Bank maintains a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) for the benefit of two key executive officers. The SERP expense recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $ 0.02 million each and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $ 0.05 million each. 2018 Incentive Plan The Company’s stockholders approved the PDL Community Bancorp 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2018 Incentive Plan”) at the Special Meeting of Stockholders on October 30, 2018. The maximum number of shares of common stock which can be issued under the 2018 Incentive Plan is 1,248,469 . Of the 1,248,469 shares, the maximum number of shares that may be awarded under the 2018 Incentive Plan pursuant to the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) is 891,764 shares (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options), and the number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units is 356,705 shares. However, the 2018 Incentive Plan contains a flex feature that provides that awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units in excess of the 356,705 share limitation may be granted but each share of stock covered by such excess award shall reduce the 891,764 share limitation for awards of stock options and SARs by 3.0 shares of common stock. The Company converted 462,522 awards of stock options into 154,174 restricted stock units in 2018, 45,000 awards of stock options into 15,000 restricted stock units in 2020 and 191,145 awards of stock options into 63,715 restricted stock units in 2022. Under the 2018 Incentive Plan, the Company made grants equal to 674,645 shares on December 4, 2018 which include 119,176 incentive options to executive officers, 44,590 non-qualified options to outside directors, 322,254 restricted stock units to executive officers, 40,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers and 148,625 restricted stock units to outside directors. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company awarded 40,000 incentive options and 15,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers under the 2018 Incentive Plan. Awards to directors generally vest 20 % annually beginning with the first anniversary of the date of grant. Awards to a director with fewer than five years of service at the time of grant vest over a longer period and will not become fully vested until the director has completed ten years of service. Awards to the executive officer who is not a director vest 20 % annually beginning on December 4, 2020. On April 1, 2022, the Company awarded 23,718 incentive options to an executive officer, 30,659 incentive options to non-executive officers and 13,952 non-qualified options to an outside director. In addition, on April 1, 2022 the Company awarded 40,460 restricted stock units to executive officers and 23,255 restricted stock units to outside directors. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the maximum number of stock options and SARs remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan for both periods was 4,883 , after the conversion from PDL Community Bancorp common stock to Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock or restricted stock units remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was none , for both periods. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determine the fair value of restricted stock units under the Company’s 2018 Incentive Plan. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. 34 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) A summary of the Company’s restricted stock unit awards activity and related information for nine months ended September 30, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022 are as follows: September 30, 2023 Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested, beginning of year 245,840 $ 9.40 Granted — — Vested ( 4,147 ) 9.27 Forfeited — — Non-vested at March 31 241,693 $ 9.40 Granted — — Vested ( 21,235 ) 10.44 Forfeited ( 697 ) 9.15 Non-vested at June 30 219,761 $ 9.30 Granted — — Vested ( 4,186 ) 7.20 Forfeited — — Non-vested at September 30 215,575 $ 9.34 December 31, 2022 Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested, beginning of year 237,687 $ 12.65 Conversion and reorganization 93,933 — Granted 63,715 10.44 Vested ( 149,495 ) 9.11 Forfeited — — Non-vested at December 31 245,840 $ 9.40 Compensation expense related to restricted stock units was $ 0.4 million each for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 and was $ 1.1 million and $ 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The weighted average period over which compensation expenses are expected to be recognized is 2.9 years. There were 218,433 shares and 190,508 shares exercisable as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. Total compensation cost related to stock options recognized was $ 0.05 million both for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , and $ 0.1 million both for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. As of September 30, 2023 , the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options was $ 0.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next 17 quarters. 36 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Dividend yield N/A 0.00 % Expected life N/A 6.5 years Expected volatility N/A 41.34 % Risk-free interest rate N/A 2.65 % Weighted average grant date fair value N/A $ 3.85 The expected volatility is based on the Company’s historical volatility. The expected life is an estimate based on management’s review of the various factors and calculated using the simplified method for plain vanilla options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s history and expectation of dividend payouts. 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan The Company’s stockholders approved the 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) at the Special Meeting of Stockholders on June 15, 2023. The maximum number of shares of common stock which can be issued under the Plan is 1,920,368 . Of the 1,920,368 shares, the maximum number of shares that may be awarded under the Plan pursuant to the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) is 1,371,691 shares (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options), and the number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units is 548,677 shares. There have been no grants of stock options and restricted stock awards or restricted stock units under the 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Treasury Stock : The Company adopted a share repurchase program effective May 16, 2023 which was completed in August of 2023. Under the repurchase program, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to 1,235,000 shares of the Company's stock or approximately 5 % of the Company's then current issued and outstanding shares.

Note 12. Earnings Per Share The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (Dollars in thousands except share data) Net income (loss) $ 2,590 $ ( 14,738 ) $ 2,834 $ ( 20,787 ) - Common shares outstanding for basic EPS: Weighted average common shares outstanding 23,774,317 24,727,459 24,456,108 24,072,543 Less: Weighted average unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) shares 1,502,241 1,632,600 1,535,428 1,548,066 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 22,272,076 23,094,859 22,920,680 22,524,477 Basic earnings (loss) per common share $ 0.12 $ ( 0.64 ) $ 0.12 $ ( 0.92 ) Potential dilutive common shares: Add: Dilutive effect of restricted stock awards and stock options 77,141 — 42,276 — Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 22,349,217 23,094,859 22,962,956 22,524,477 Diluted earnings (loss) per common share $ 0.12 $ ( 0.64 ) $ 0.12 $ ( 0.92 ) 37 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 13. Commitments, Contingencies and Credit Risk Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk : In the normal course of business, financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk may be used to meet the financing needs of customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement in particular classes of financial instruments. The contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit represent the amounts of potential accounting loss should the contract be fully drawn upon, the customer default, and the value of any existing collateral become worthless. The same credit policies are used in making commitments and contractual obligations as for on-balance-sheet instruments. Financial instruments whose contractual amounts represent credit risk at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows: September 30, December 31, 2023 2022 (in thousands) Commitments to grant mortgage loans $ 445,152 $ 207,105 Commitments to sell loans at lock-in rates — 1,676 Unfunded commitments under lines of credit 62,114 72,530 $ 507,266 $ 281,311 Commitments to Grant Mortgage Loans : Commitments to grant mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as all terms and conditions are met as established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties. Material losses are not anticipated as a result of these transactions. Commitments to Sell Loans at Lock-in Rates: In order to assure itself of a marketplace to sell its loans, Mortgage World has agreements with investors who will commit to purchase loans at locked-in rates. Mortgage World has off-balance sheet market risk to the extent that Mortgage World does not obtain matching commitments from these investors to purchase the loans. This will expose Mortgage World to the lower of cost or market valuation environment. Repurchases, Indemnifications and Premium Recaptures : Loans sold by Mortgage World under investor programs are subject to repurchase or indemnification if they fail to meet the origination criteria of those programs. In addition, loans sold to investors are also subject to repurchase or indemnifications if the loan is two or three months delinquent during a set period which usually varies from six months to a year after the loan is sold. There are no open repurchase or indemnification requests for loans sold as a correspondent lender or where the Company acted as a broker in the transaction as of September 30, 2023. Unfunded Commitments Under Lines of Credit : Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extension of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit are uncollateralized and usually contain a specified maturity date and, ultimately, may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed. Unfunded Commitments with Bamboo : On October 1, 2022, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Bamboo Payment Holding LLC (""Bamboo""). Under the agreement, the Company purchased from Bamboo 180 Membership Interest Units representing an aggregate amount equal to up to 18 % of total issued and outstanding Membership Interest in Bamboo for a purchase price of $ 2.5 million. During the first nine months of 2023, the Company made three additional contributions for a total of $ 1.0 million for a total investment in Bamboo of $ 3.5 million and is committed to make an additional payment of $ 0.2 million in November of 2023. With over a decade processing payments in Latin America, Bamboo has a diverse network connects Latin American local payment processing to global companies as well as domestic solutions to locally based organizations. Unfunded Commitments with Oaktree : In December of 2021, the Bank committed to invest $ 5.0 million in Oaktree SBIC Fund, L.P. (""Oaktree""). As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total unfunded commitment was $ 2.4 million and $ 2.8 million, respectively. 38 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Unfunded Commitments with Silvergate : In April of 2022, the Company committed to invest $ 5.0 million in EJF Silvergate Ventures Fund LP (""Silvergate""). As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total unfunded commitment was $ 2.6 million and $ 3.3 million, respectively. Letters of Credit : Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Letters of credit are largely cash secured. Concentration by Geographic Location : Loans, commitments to extend credit and letters of credit have been granted to customers who are located primarily in the New York City metropolitan area. Generally, such loans most often are secured by one-to-four family residential properties. The loans are expected to be repaid from the borrowers' cash flows. Legal Matters : The Company is involved in various legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal course of business. Management believes that resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Note 14. Fair Value The following fair value hierarchy is used based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2 – Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: Cash and Cash Equivalents, Placements with Banks, Accrued Interest Receivable, Advance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance, and Accrued Interest Payable : The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. These assets and liabilities are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Available-for-Sale Securities : These financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models (e.g., matrix pricing) or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Examples of such instruments include government agency bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Level 3 securities are securities for which significant unobservable inputs are utilized. There were no changes in valuation techniques used to measure similar assets during the period. FHLBNY Stock : The carrying value of FHLBNY stock approximates fair value since the Bank can redeem such stock with FHLBNY at cost. As a member of the FHLBNY, the Company is required to purchase this stock, which is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. Loans Receivable : For variable rate loans, which reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, carrying values are a reasonable estimate of fair values, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using estimated market rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. Impaired loans are valued using a present value discounted cash flow method, or the fair value of the collateral. Loans are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Loans Held for Sale : Loans held for sale, at fair value, consists of loans originated for sale by the Bank and accounted for under the fair value option. These assets are valued using stated investor pricing for substantially equivalent loans as Level 2. In determining fair value, such measurements are derived based on observable market data, including whole-loan transaction pricing and similar market transactions adjusted for portfolio composition, servicing value and market conditions. Loans held for sale by the Bank are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by investor bid prices. Under the fair value option, management has elected, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, fair value for substantially all forms of mortgage loans originated for sale on a recurring basis. The fair value carrying amount of mortgages held for sale measured under the fair value option was $ 14.1 million and the aggregate unpaid principal amounted to $ 14.0 million. 39 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Other Real Estate Owned : Other real estate owned represents real estate acquired through foreclosure, and is recorded at fair value less estimated disposal costs on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the asset is classified as Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the asset is classified as Level 3. Deposits : The fair values of demand deposits, savings, NOW and money market accounts equal their carrying amounts, which represent the amounts payable on demand at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-term, fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates on certificates of deposit to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on such deposits. Deposits are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. FHLBNY Advances : The fair value of the advances is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current market-based FHLBNY interest rates for advances of similar maturity to a schedule of maturities of such advances. These borrowings are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Warehouse Lines of Credit : The carrying amounts of warehouse lines of credit and mortgage loan funding payable approximate fair value and due to their short-term nature are classified as Level 2. One of the warehouse lines of credit was terminated on March 31, 2022 and one was terminated on February 7, 2023 Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments : Fair values for off-balance-sheet instruments (lending commitments and standby letters of credit) are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit standing. Off-balance-sheet instruments are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The following tables detail the assets that are carried at fair value and measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and indicate the level within the fair value hierarchy utilized to determine the fair value: September 30, 2023 Description Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities, at fair value: U.S. Government Bonds $ 2,713 $ 2,713 $ — $ — Corporate bonds 23,190 729 22,461 — Mortgage-Backed Securities: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 32,989 — 32,989 — FHLMC Certificates 8,537 — 8,537 — FNMA Certificates 49,219 — 49,219 — GNMA Certificates 105 — 105 — Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at fair value 14,103 — 14,103 — $ 130,856 $ 3,442 $ 127,414 $ — December 31, 2022 Description Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities, at fair value: U.S. Government Bonds $ 2,689 $ 2,689 $ — $ — Corporate bonds 23,359 730 22,629 — Mortgage-Backed Securities: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 37,777 — 37,777 — FHLMC Certificates 9,634 — 9,634 — FNMA Certificates 55,928 — 55,928 — GNMA Certificates 118 — 118 — Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at fair value 1,979 — 1,979 — Derivatives from interest rate lock commitments 22 — — 22 $ 131,506 $ 3,419 $ 128,065 $ 22 Management’s assessment and classification of an investment within a level can change over time based upon maturity or liquidity of the investment and would be reflected at the beginning of the quarter in which the change occurred. 40 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following tables detail the assets carried at fair value and measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and indicate the fair value hierarchy utilized to determine the fair value: September 30, 2023 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Impaired loans $ 9,396 $ — $ — $ 9,396 December 31, 2022 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Impaired loans $ 17,952 $ — $ — $ 17,952 Losses on assets carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were de minimis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

September 30, December 31, 2023 2022 (in thousands) Beginning balance $ — $ 4,929 Total loss included in earnings — ( 344 ) Transfer out of level 3 — ( 4,585 ) Ending balance $ — $ — The Company recognizes transfers between levels of the valuation hierarchy at the end of the applicable reporting periods. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 assets or liabilities in the fair value hierarchy at September 30, 2023 and one security transferred out of Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2022. Fair value for Level 3 securities was determined using a third-party pricing service with limited levels of activity and price transparency. Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments : Loan commitments on which the committed interest rate is less than the current market rate are insignificant at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The fair value information about financial instruments are disclosed, whether or not recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. The estimated fair value amounts for 2023 and 2022 have been measured as of their respective period-ends and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these consolidated financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than amounts reported at each period. The information presented should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only required for a limited portion of the Company's assets and liabilities. Due to the wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company's disclosures and those of other banks may not be meaningful. Note 15. Regulatory Capital Requirements The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain 42 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s operations and financial statements. Under the regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total risk-based and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (as defined), common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined), and Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets (as defined) adjusted total assets (as defined). As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the applicable capital adequacy requirements specified below have been met. The below minimum capital requirements exclude the capital conservation buffer required to avoid limitations on capital distributions including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The applicable capital buffer for the Bank was 17.10 % at September 30, 2023 and 22.53 % at December 31, 2022. The most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Company and the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, common equity risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There were no conditions or events since then that have changed the Bank's category. The Company's and the Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 as compared to regulatory requirements are as follows: To Be Well Capitalized Under For Capital Prompt Corrective Actual Adequacy Purposes Action Provisions Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 Ponce Financial Group, Inc.

Failure to maintain minimum capital requirements could result in the Bank’s Mortgage World division being unable to originate and service loans, and, therefore, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Bank's minimum net worth requirements as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are reflected below: Minimum Requirement (in thousands) September 30, 2023 HUD $ 1,000 Minimum Requirement (in thousands) December 31, 2022 HUD $ 1,000 As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Bank was in compliance with the applicable minimum capital requirements specified above.

Transactions with Related Parties Directors, executive officers and non-executive officers of the Company have been customers of and have had transactions with the Bank, and it is expected that such persons will continue to have such transactions in the future. Aggregate loan transactions with related parties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows: For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in thousand) Beginning balance (1) $ 8,614 $ 7,532 $ 8,318 $ 5,631 Originations (1) 50 1,223 678 5,418 Payments ( 851 ) ( 269 ) ( 1,183 ) ( 2,563 ) Ending balance $ 7,813 $ 8,486 $ 7,813 $ 8,486 44 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The Company held deposits in the amount of $ 7.0 million and $ 8.0 million from directors, executive officers and non-executive officers at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. Note 18. Subsequent Events In order to better manage its interest rate risk, on October 12, 2023 the Bank entered into two interest rate swap transactions with Goldman Sachs Bank USA. One interest rate swap is for a period of two years effective October 12, 2023 and terminates on November 1, 2025 with a notional amount of $ 150.0 million. The Bank will pay a fixed rate of interest of 4.885 % and receive the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") rate. The other interest rate swap is for a period of three years effective October 12, 2023 and terminates on November 1, 2026 with a notional amount of $ 100.0 million. The Bank will pay a fixed rate of interest of 4.62 % and receive the SOFR rate. 45 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. (the “Company”). The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in Part I, Item 1, of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""intend,"" ""anticipate,"" ""assume,"" ""plan,"" ""seek,"" ""expect,"" ""will,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""indicate,"" ""would,"" ""believe,"" ""contemplate,"" ""continue,"" ""target"" and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: These forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company’s control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 46 Additional factors that may affect the Company’s results are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 under the heading “Risk Factors” filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 21, 2023. Because of these and other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. The Company is under no duty to and does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following discussion contains certain non-GAAP financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide the reader with additional supplemental perspective on operating results, performance trends, and financial condition. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial information. The Company’s non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP information which may be presented by other companies. In all cases, it should be understood that non-GAAP operating measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders. An item that management excludes when computing non-GAAP adjusted earnings can be of substantial importance to the Company’s results and condition for any particular year. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided below. The SEC has exempted from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on GAAP. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. However, the information should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The table below includes references to the Company's net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 before the Company’s contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation. In management's view, that information, which is considered non-GAAP information, may be useful to investors as it will improve an understanding of core operations for the current and future periods. The non-GAAP net income (loss) amount and earnings (loss) per share reflect adjustments related to the non-recurring gain on sale of real property and the Company’s contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation, net of tax effect. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP information to GAAP net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share is provided below. 47 Non-GAAP Reconciliation – Net Income (Loss) before the Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation (Unaudited) Nine Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net income (loss) - GAAP $ 2,834 $ (20,787 ) Loss on sale of premises and equipment — 436 Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation — 4,995 Income tax benefit — (1,141 ) Net income (loss) - non-GAAP $ 2,834 $ (16,497 ) Earnings (loss) per common share (GAAP) (1) $ 0.12 $ (0.92 ) Earnings (loss) per common share (non-GAAP) (1) $ 0.12 $ (0.73 ) The CARES Act On March 27, 2020, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) to address the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act appropriated $349.0 billion for PPP loans and on April 24, 2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) received another $310.0 billion in PPP funding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act appropriated $284.0 billion for both first and second draw PPP loans, bringing the total appropriations for PPP loans to $943.0 billion. PPP ended on May 31, 2021. Loans under the PPP that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The Company had received SBA approval and originated 5,340 PPP loans, of which 7 loans totaling $1.1 million were outstanding at September 30, 2023. PPP loans have a two-year or five-year term, provide for fees of up to 5% of the loan amount and earn interest at a rate of 1% per annum. Federal Economic Relief Funds To Aid Lending On June 7, 2022, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. (the “Company”), the holding company for Ponce Bank,‎ closed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 225,000 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A‎, par value $0.01 (the “Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price equal to $225,000,000 in cash, to the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) pursuant to the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”).‎ The holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a dividend payable in cash quarterly at an annual rate dependent on certain factors as reported by the Company to Treasury in a quarterly supplemental report. The initial dividend rate is zero percent for the first two years after issuance, and thereafter the floor dividend rate is 0.50% and the ceiling dividend rate is 2.00%. After 10 years of issuance, the perpetual dividend rate in effect, will be determined based on said floor and ceiling. The actual dividend rate that will be paid by the Company on the Preferred Stock cannot be determined at this time. The ECIP investment by the Treasury is part of a program to invest over $8.7 billion into Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) or ‎Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), of which Ponce Bank is both. The ECIP is intended to incentivize CDFIs and MDIs to provide loans, grants, ‎and forbearance to small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers in low-income and underserved communities that may have been ‎disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. 48 CDFI Equitable Recovery Program On September 26, 2023, the Bank received a $3.7 million grant from the U.S. Treasury as part of the Community Development Financial Institutions (""CDFI"") Equitable Recovery Program (""ERP"") which aims to help CDFI's further their mission of helping low and low-to-moderate income communities recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bank Enterprise Award Program The Bank received approval for a grant in the amount of $0.5 million as part of the Bank Enterprise Award Program from the CDFI. Awards under the Bank Enterprise Award Program are subject to the program terms and must be used for qualified activities, which include providing loans, investments and financial services to residents and businesses in distressed communities. Critical Accounting Policies Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management and that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets, liabilities or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is established as probable incurred losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. Credit losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. See Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the accompanying Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. Factors Affecting the Comparability of Results Ponce De Leon Foundation. On January 27, 2022, the Company made a $5.0 million contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation as part of the conversion and reorganization, which is included in non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Write-off and Write-Down. In 2020, the Company entered into a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain. Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to $1,500 and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originates and services these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan is found to be fraudulent, becomes 90 days delinquent upon 90 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.” At December 31, 2022, the Bank had 27,886 Grain microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $18.2 million and which were performing, in management's opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by a $15.4 million allowance for loan losses, resulting in $2.8 million in Grain microloans, net of allowance for loan losses. At September 30, 2023, the Bank had 16,687 Grain microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $9.3 million and which were performing, in management’s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by an $8.1 million allowance for credit losses, resulting in $1.2 million in Grain microloans. Since the beginning of the Bank’s agreement with Grain and through 49 September 30, 2023, 45,322 microloans amounting to $24.3 million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain. The Company has written-down a total of $15.6 million, net of recoveries, of the Grain Receivable and received $6.8 million in cash from Grain and through the application of security deposits connected to fraudulent loan accounts. The Bank also opted to use the $1.8 million grant it received from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Rapid Response ‎Program to defray the Grain Receivable. The application of those amounts resulted in no net receivable. Additionally, the Company wrote-off its equity investment in Grain of $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s total exposure to Grain was $1.2 million of the remaining microloans, net of allowance for credit losses, excluding $2.4 million of unused commitments available to Grain borrowers and $1.6 million of security deposits by Grain borrowers. The $1.3 million of recoveries for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the $18.5 million write-off for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 related to Grain is included in non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $1.3 million of recoveries for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, $0.7 million were payments received from Grain on the Grain Receivable and the remainder were payments from Grain borrowers.

Excludes $1.6 million of security deposits by Grain originated borrowers reported in deposits in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Conditions. Grain has been victimized by cyber fraud using synthetic and other forms of fraudulent identifications, a phenomenon that has become prevalent with Fintechs. Grain remains a pre-profit startup highly dependent on earnings from its relationship with the Bank, a new relationship with another financial institution, and further capital raises which may not materialize. The Company continues to closely monitor its portfolio of consumer loans originated by Grain as well as Grain’s refinement of solutions for detecting and preventing cyber fraud in the application for microloans. The Company has requested, and Grain has agreed, that no new microloans be originated until further notice and that further extensions of credit to an existing microloan borrower only be made upon confirmation that such borrower is not fraudulent. Further, like other start-up companies, there is a higher level of risk that Grain may not be able to execute its business plan and may fail. In the event Grain were to cease operations, and although it has considered contingency plans, the Bank may have greater difficulty in servicing and collecting the microloan portfolio. In such a case, the level the Bank has provided for in its allowance for credit losses for its microloan portfolio may be inadequate and it may need to increase its provision for credit losses, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. As a consequence of such events, the Bank may determine it appropriate to terminate its relationship with Grain. 50 Vision 2025 Evolves The Company has deployed a Fintech-based small business automated lending technology in partnership with LendingFront Technologies, Inc. The technology is a mobile application that digitizes the lending workflow from pre-approval to servicing and enables the Company to originate, close and fund small business loans within very short spans of time, without requiring a physical presence within banking offices and with automated underwriting using both traditional and non-traditional methods. The application has full loan origination and servicing capabilities and is integrated with Salesforce. All Commercial Relationship Officers and Business Development Managers will utilize these capabilities. The Company is seeking to establish loan origination partnerships with non-profit and community-based organizations to ensure penetration in underserved and underbanked markets. The Company also established a relationship with SaveBetter, LLC, a fintech startup focusing on brokered deposits. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $350.2 million in such deposits. The recent regulatory easing of brokered deposit rules may enable the Company to classify such deposits as core deposits. On October 1, 2022, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Bamboo Payment Holding LLC (""Bamboo""). Under the agreement, the Company purchased from Bamboo 180 Membership Interest Units representing an aggregate amount equal to up to 18% of total issued and outstanding Membership Interest in Bamboo for a purchase price of $2.5 million. During the first nine months of 2023, the Company made three additional contributions for a total of $1.0 million for a total investment in Bamboo of $3.5 million. With over a decade processing payments in Latin America, Bamboo has a diverse network connects Latin American local payment processing to global companies as well as domestic solutions to locally based organizations. At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $1.06 billion in assets, $918.5 million in loans and $809.8 million in deposits. The Company has since grown to $2.62 billion in assets, $1.79 billion in loans receivables, net of allowance for credit losses of $27.4 million, and $1.40 billion in deposits at September 30, 2023, all while investing in infrastructure, implementing digital banking, acquiring Mortgage World, adopting GPS, diversifying its product offering and partnering with Fintech companies. The Company raised over $132.0 million in additional capital through our conversion and reorganization and realized approximately $20.0 million in net gain while freeing up approximately $40.0 million in investable funds through our sale-and-leaseback initiative. Now, the Company believes that it is poised to enhance its presence, locally and in similar communities outside New York, as a leading CDFI and MDI financial institution holding company. On June 7, 2022, the Company issued 225,000 shares of the Company’s Preferred Stock‎, par value $0.01 for an aggregate purchase price equal to $225.0 million in cash to the Treasury, pursuant to the Treasury’s ECIP‎. Under the ECIP, Treasury provided investment capital directly to depository institutions that are CDFIs or MDIs or their holding companies, to provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers, in low-income and underserved communities. Treasury has indicated that the investment will qualify as Tier 1 capital. No dividends will accrue or be due for the first two years after issuance. For years three through ten, depending upon the level of qualified and/or deep impact lending made in targeted communities, as defined in the ECIP guidelines, dividends will be at an annual rate of either 2.0%, 1.25% or 0.5% and, thereafter, will be fixed at one of the foregoing rates. Holders of Preferred Stock generally do not have any voting rights, with the exception of voting rights on certain matters as outlined in the Certificate of Designations. The Company has the option to redeem the shares of Preferred Stock (i) in whole or in part on any dividend payment date on or after June 15, 2027, or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within ninety days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, as defined below, in each case at a cash redemption price equal to the liquidation amount, with an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not paid prior to the redemption date. The Company may not redeem shares of Preferred Stock without having received the prior approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency for the Company, as defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, to the extent required under applicable capital rules. Such redemptions are subject to certain conditions and limitations. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. A “Regulatory Capital Treatment Event” means a good-faith determination that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws, rules or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any agency or instrumentality of the United States, including the Federal Reserve and other appropriate federal bank regulatory agencies) that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any share of the Preferred Stock; (ii) any proposed change in those laws, rules or regulations that is announced after the initial issuance of any share of the Preferred Stock; or (iii) any official administrative or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws, rules or regulations or policies with respect thereto that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of the Preferred Stock, there is more than an insubstantial risk that we will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation preferences of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding as “Additional Tier 1 Capital” (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy standards of Federal Reserve Regulation Q, 12 C.F.R. Part 217 (or, as and if applicable, the successor capital adequacy guidelines, 51 rules or regulations of the Federal Reserve or the capital adequacy guidelines, rules or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency), as then in effect and applicable, for as long as any share of Preferred Stock is outstanding. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 Total Assets . Total consolidated assets increased $311.9 million, or 13.5%, to $2.62 billion at September 30, 2023 from $2.31 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in total assets is largely attributable to increases of $294.5 million in net loans receivable, $62.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, $12.1 million in mortgage loans held for sale and $2.3 million in other assets, offset by decreases of $39.8 million in held-to-maturity securities, $12.8 million in available-for-sale securities and $5.8 million in Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock. Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents increased $62.7 million, or 115.3%, to $117.0 million at September 30, 2023, compared to $54.4 million at December 31, 2022. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of increases of $157.7 million in net borrowings and $148.7 million in net deposits, proceeds of $48.6 million from maturities/calls of securities and $32.8 million in proceeds from the sale of loans, offset by increases of $294.6 million in net loans and $42.8 million in loans held for sale and $11.0 million in share repurchases. . 52 Securities.

The decrease was primarily due to a call on one of the securities in the amount of $10.0 million and changes in principal. 53 Gross Loans Receivable. The composition of gross loans receivable at September 30, 2023 and at December 31, 2022 and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows: September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Increase (Decrease) Amount Percent Amount Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential Investor-Owned $ 347,082 19.1 % $ 343,968 22.6 % $ 3,114 0.9 % Owner-Occupied 151,866 8.4 % 134,878 8.8 % 16,988 12.6 % Multifamily residential 553,694 30.5 % 494,667 32.4 % 59,027 11.9 % Nonresidential properties 321,472 17.7 % 308,043 20.2 % 13,429 4.4 % Construction and land 411,383 22.7 % 185,018 12.1 % 226,365 122.3 % Total mortgage loans 1,785,497 98.4 % 1,466,574 96.1 % 318,923 21.7 % Nonmortgage loans: Business loans (1) 18,416 1.0 % 39,965 2.6 % (21,549 ) (53.9 %) Consumer loans (2) 10,416 0.6 % 19,129 1.3 % (8,713 ) (45.5 %) 28,832 1.6 % 59,094 3.9 % (30,262 ) (51.2 %) Total $ 1,814,329 100.0 % $ 1,525,668 100.0 % $ 288,661 18.9 % Based on current internal loan reviews, the Company believes that the quality of our underwriting, our weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 58.3% and our customer selection processes have served us well and provided us with a reliable base with which to maintain a well-protected loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans, as defined by applicable banking regulations, include multifamily residential, nonresidential properties, and construction and land mortgage loans. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximately 4.9% and 6.4%, respectively, of the outstanding principal balance of the Bank’s commercial real estate mortgage loans were secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses predominantly on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on valuation of the real estate. Banking regulations have established guidelines relating to the amount of construction and land mortgage loans and investor- owned commercial real estate mortgage loans of 100% and 300% of total risk-based capital, respectively. Should a bank’s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. The Bank’s policy is to operate within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and up to 400% for investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank’s total risk-based capital. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Bank’s construction and land mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 85.1% and 38.5%, respectively. Investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 251.7% and 194.0% as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. At September 30, 2023, the Bank was within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and the 300% guideline for investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans established by banking regulators. Management believes that it has established the appropriate level of controls to monitor the Bank’s lending in these areas. Loans Held For Sale . Loans held for sale, at fair value, at September 30, 2023 increased $12.1 million, or 612.6%, to $14.1 million from $2.0 million at December 31, 2022. 54 Deposits. The composition of deposits at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and changes in dollars and percentages are summarized as follows: September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Increase (Decrease) Percent Percent Amount of Total Amount of Total Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Demand $ 265,862 19.0 % $ 289,149 23.1 % $ (23,287 ) (8.1 %) Interest-bearing deposits: NOW/IOLA accounts 22,519 1.6 % 24,349 1.9 % (1,830 ) (7.5 %) Money market accounts (1) 370,500 26.4 % 236,143 18.9 % 134,357 56.9 % Reciprocal deposits 82,670 5.9 % 114,049 9.1 % (31,379 ) (27.5 %) Savings accounts 117,870 8.4 % 130,432 10.4 % (12,562 ) (9.6 %) Total NOW, money market, reciprocal and savings 593,559 42.3 % 504,973 40.3 % 88,586 17.5 % Certificates of deposit of $250K or more (1) 122,353 8.7 % 106,336 8.5 % 16,017 15.1 % Brokered certificates of deposit (2) 98,729 7.1 % 98,754 7.9 % (25 ) (0.0 %) Listing service deposits (2) 15,180 1.1 % 35,813 2.9 % (20,633 ) (57.6 %) Certificates of deposit less than $250K (1) 305,449 21.8 % 217,387 17.3 % 88,062 40.5 % Total certificates of deposit 541,711 38.7 % 458,290 36.6 % 83,421 18.2 % Total interest-bearing deposits 1,135,270 81.0 % 963,263 76.9 % 172,007 17.9 % Total deposits $ 1,401,132 100.0 % $ 1,252,412 100.0 % $ 148,720 11.9 % When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the Company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk and interest rate risk in line with management objectives. The Company’s Interest Rate Risk Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding and noncore funding reliance. The overall reliance on wholesale funding and noncore funding were within those policy limitations as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Management Asset/Liability Committee generally meets on a bi-weekly basis to review funding needs, if any, and to ensure the Company operates within the approved limitations. Borrowings . The Bank had outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2023 of $675.1 million in term advances from the FHLBNY and FRBNY and $511.4 million of outstanding term advances from the FHLBNY at December 31, 2022. The Bank also had $6.0 million of overnight line of credit advance from the FHLBNY at December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Bank had two unsecured lines of credit in the amount of $75.0 million and $90.0 million with two correspondent banks at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, under which there was nothing outstanding at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Bank had no overnight line of credit advance at September 30, 2023. Stockholders’ Equity . The Company’s consolidated stockholders’ equity decreased $7.6 million, or 1.55%, to $485.1 million at September 30, 2023 from $492.7 million at December 31, 2022. This decrease in stockholders’ equity was largely attributable to $11.0 million in share repurchases and an increase of $2.6 million in other comprehensive loss, partially offset by $2.8 million in net income, $1.2 million in share-based compensation, $1.1 million as a result of implementation of CECL and $0.8 million in ESOP. Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 The discussion of the Company’s results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 are presented below. The results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of future results. Overview. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was $2.6 million compared to net loss of ($14.7) million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Earnings per basic and diluted share was $0.12 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to loss per basic and diluted share of $(0.64) for three months ended September 30, 2022. The $17.3 million increase of net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022 was due to decreases of $8.8 million in provision for credit losses and $8.1 million in non-interest expenses and an increase of $4.1 million of non-interest income, offset by an increase of $2.5 million in provision for income taxes and a decrease of $1.1 million in net interest income. 55 The following table presents the results of operations for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Interest and dividend income $ 33,506 $ 21,634 $ 11,872 54.9 % Interest expense 16,964 4,023 12,941 321.7 % Net interest income 16,542 17,611 (1,069 ) (6.1 %) Provision for credit losses 535 9,330 (8,795 ) (94.3 %) Net interest income after provision for loan losses 16,007 8,281 7,726 93.3 % Non-interest income 5,627 1,577 4,050 256.8 % Non-interest expense 17,316 25,416 (8,100 ) (31.9 %) Loss income before income taxes 4,318 (15,558 ) 19,876 (127.8 %) Benefit for income taxes 1,728 (820 ) 2,548 (310.7 %) Net (loss) income $ 2,590 $ (14,738 ) $ 17,328 (117.6 %) Earnings per share: Basic $ 0.12 $ (0.64 ) $ 0.76 (118.4 %) Diluted $ 0.12 $ (0.64 ) $ 0.76 (118.4 %) Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $11.9 million, or 54.9%, to $33.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from $21.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Interest income on loans receivable, which is the Company’s primary source of income, increased $8.2 million, or 48.2%, to $25.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from $17.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks increased $3.7 million, or 79.9%, to $8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from $4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The following table presents interest income on loans receivable for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) 1-4 Family residential $ 7,610 $ 5,023 $ 2,587 51.5 % Multifamily residential 6,883 4,472 2,411 53.9 % Nonresidential properties 4,020 3,142 878 27.9 % Construction and land 6,133 3,011 3,122 103.7 % Business loans 321 539 (218 ) (40.4 %) Consumer loans 309 871 (562 ) (64.5 %) Total interest income on loans receivable $ 25,276 $ 17,058 $ 8,218 48.2 % The following table presents interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Interest on deposits due from banks $ 1,968 $ 346 $ 1,622 468.8 % Interest on securities 5,821 4,154 1,667 40.1 % Dividend on FHLBNY stock 441 76 365 480.3 % Total interest and dividend income $ 8,230 $ 4,576 $ 3,654 79.9 % Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $12.9 million, or 321.7%, to $17.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase average cost of funds. 56 The following table presents interest expense for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Certificates of deposit $ 4,362 $ 855 $ 3,507 410.2 % Money market $ 5,600 $ 1,305 4,295 329.1 % Savings $ 29 $ 55 (26 ) (47.3 %) NOW/IOLA $ 8 $ 13 (5 ) (38.5 %) Advance payments by borrowers $ 2 $ 2 — 0.0 % Borrowings $ 6,963 $ 1,793 5,170 288.3 % Total interest expense $ 16,964 $ 4,023 $ 12,941 321.7 % Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased $1.1 million, or 6.1%, to $16.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from $17.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The $1.1 million decrease in net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022 was attributable to an increase of $12.9 million in interest expense due primarily to a higher average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities, offset by an increase of $11.9 million in interest and dividend income primarily due to increases in average loans receivable and interest and dividend on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks. Net interest rate spread decreased by 150 basis point to 1.58% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from 3.08% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in the net interest rate spread for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 231 basis points to 3.64% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from 1.33% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and an increase in the average yields on interest-earning assets of 81 basis points to 5.22% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from 4.41% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Net interest margin decreased 101 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.58% from 3.59% for three months ended September 30, 2022, reflecting an increase in our securities portfolio and our organic loan growth. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%-5.50% during its July 26, 2023 meeting, pushing borrowing costs to the highest level in 22 years. The Federal Reserve has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $4.1 million, or 256.8%, to $5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022 was attributable to a grant of $3.7 million received in the third quarter of 2023 from the Treasury as part of the CDFI Equitable Recovery Program and a $0.5 million in assignment fee that was recognized in the third quarter of 2023. The following table presents non-interest income for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Service charges and fees $ 516 $ 464 $ 52 11.2 % Brokerage commissions 17 288 (271 ) (94.1 %) Late and prepayment charges 899 109 790 724.8 % Income on sale of mortgage loans 173 116 57 49.1 % Loan origination — 522 (522 ) (100.0 %) Grant income 3,718 — 3,718 — % Loss on sale of premises and equipment — (436 ) 436 (100.0 %) Other 304 514 (210 ) (40.9 %) Total non-interest income $ 5,627 $ 1,577 $ 4,050 256.8 % 57 Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense decreased $8.1 million, or 31.9%, to $17.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from $25.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The $8.1 million decrease in non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022 was mainly attributable to $8.9 million of Grain consumer microloans write-offs during the third quarter of 2022 and a decrease of $0.3 million in direct loan expense, partially offset by increases of $0.6 million in data processing expenses and $0.4 million in professional fees.

The results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of future results. Overview. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $2.8 million compared to net loss of ($20.8) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Earnings per basic and diluted share was $0.12 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to loss per basic and diluted share of ($0.92) for nine months ended September 30, 2022. The $23.6 million increase of net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to decreases of $19.3 million in non-interest expenses and $10.1 million in provision for loan losses and an increase of $3.0 million in non-interest income, partially offset by an increase of a $6.3 million in provision for income taxes and a decrease of $2.4 million in net interest income. The following table presents the results of operations for the periods indicated: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Interest and dividend income $ 90,917 $ 57,819 $ 33,098 57.2 % Interest expense 42,848 7,382 35,466 480.4 % Net interest income 48,069 50,437 (2,368 ) (4.7 %) Provision for credit losses 1,348 11,405 (10,057 ) (88.2 %) Net interest income after provision for loan losses 46,721 39,032 7,689 19.7 % Non-interest income 8,938 5,982 2,956 49.4 % Non-interest expense 50,766 70,057 (19,291 ) (27.5 %) Income (loss) before income taxes 4,893 (25,043 ) 29,936 (119.5 %) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 2,059 (4,256 ) 6,315 (148.4 %) Net income (loss) $ 2,834 $ (20,787 ) $ 23,621 (113.6 %) Earnings (loss) per share: Basic $ 0.12 $ (0.92 ) $ 1.04 (112.3 %) Diluted $ 0.12 $ (0.92 ) $ 1.04 (112.3 %) 60 Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $33.1 million, or 57.2%, to $90.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from $57.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Interest income on loans receivable, which is the Company’s primary source of income, increased $16.7 million, or 32.5%, to $68.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from $51.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks increased $16.4 million, or 252.5%, to $22.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from $6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The following table presents interest income on loans receivable for the periods indicated: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) 1-4 Family residential $ 21,257 $ 15,173 $ 6,084 40.1 % Multifamily residential 19,705 12,445 7,260 58.3 % Nonresidential properties 11,476 9,089 2,387 26.3 % Construction and land 13,091 7,428 5,663 76.2 % Business loans 1,259 4,250 (2,991 ) (70.4 %) Consumer loans 1,203 2,930 (1,727 ) (58.9 %) Total interest income on loans receivable $ 67,991 $ 51,315 $ 16,676 32.5 % The following table presents interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks for the periods indicated: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Interest on deposits due from banks $ 3,982 $ 514 $ 3,468 674.7 % Interest on securities 17,627 5,779 11,848 205.0 % Dividend on FHLBNY stock 1,317 211 1,106 524.2 % Total interest and dividend income $ 22,926 $ 6,504 $ 16,422 252.5 % Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $35.5 million, or 480.4%, to $42.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from $7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in the average cost of funds. For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Certificates of deposit $ 11,468 $ 2,361 $ 9,107 385.7 % Money market 12,745 1,987 10,758 541.4 % Savings 88 120 (32 ) (26.7 %) NOW/IOLA 25 43 (18 ) (41.9 %) Advance payments by borrowers 6 4 2 50.0 % Borrowings 18,516 2,867 15,649 545.8 % Total interest expense $ 42,848 $ 7,382 $ 35,466 480.4 % Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased $2.4 million, or 4.7%, to $48.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from $50.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The $2.4 million decrease in net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was attributable to an increase of $35.5 million in interest expense due primarily to a higher average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities, offset by an increase of $33.1 million in interest and dividend income primarily due to increases in average loans receivable, interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks. Net interest rate spread decreased by 196 basis point to 1.66% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from 3.62% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in the net interest rate spread for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 244 basis points to 3.36% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from 0.92% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and an increase in the average yields on interest-earning assets of 48 basis points to 5.02% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from 4.54% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 61 Net interest margin decreased 131 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.65% from 3.96% for nine months ended September 30, 2022, reflecting an increase in cost of funds. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%-5.50% during its July 26, 2023 meeting, pushing borrowing costs to the highest level in 22 years. The Federal Reserve has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $3.0 million, or 49.4%, to $8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from $6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was attributable to a grant of $3.7 million received in the third quarter of 2023 from the Treasury and an increase of $1.6 million in late and prepayment charges, partially offset by a decrease of $1.8 million in loan origination. The following table presents non-interest income for the periods indicated: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Service charges and fees $ 1,488 $ 1,349 $ 139 10.3 % Brokerage commissions 67 840 $ (773 ) (92.0 %) Late and prepayment charges 2,000 360 1,640 455.6 % Income on sale of mortgage loans 354 734 (380 ) (51.8 %) Loan origination — 1,843 (1,843 ) (100.0 %) Grant income 3,718 — 3,718 — % Loss on sale of premises and equipment — (436 ) 436 (100.0 %) Other 1,311 1,292 19 1.5 % Total non-interest income $ 8,938 $ 5,982 $ 2,956 49.4 % Non-Interest Expense.

The $19.3 million decrease in non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was attributable to $18.5 million of Grain consumer microloan write-offs during the corresponding period last year compared with $1.3 million of Grain consumer microloan recoveries recognized during the current period. The decrease in non-interest expense was also impacted by a $5.0 million contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation during the corresponding period last year, partially offset by increases of $1.3 million in provision for contingencies, $1.3 million in data processing expenses, $1.0 million in compensation and benefits and $0.7 million in professional fees. 62 The following table presents non-interest expense for the periods indicated: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Compensation and benefits $ 22,437 $ 21,413 $ 1,024 4.8 % Occupancy and equipment 10,882 10,040 842 8.4 % Data processing expenses 3,982 2,665 1,317 49.4 % Direct loan expense 1,126 2,033 (907 ) (44.6 %) Provision for contingencies 1,893 566 1,327 234.5 % Insurance and surety bond premiums 768 600 168 28.0 % Office supplies, telephone and postage 1,189 1,180 9 0.8 % Professional fees 5,052 4,333 719 16.6 % Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation — 4,995 (4,995 ) (100.0 %) Grain (recoveries) write-off (1,329 ) 18,455 (19,784 ) (107.2 %) Marketing and promotional expenses 679 337 342 101.5 % Directors' fees and regulatory assessment 484 509 (25 ) (4.9 %) Other operating expenses 3,603 2,931 672 22.9 % Total non-interest expense $ 50,766 $ 70,057 $ (19,291 ) (27.5 %) Income Tax (Benefit) Provision.

The most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of the Bank’s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of its financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. The Bank’s Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in the Bank’s assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given the business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with policies and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank currently utilizes a third-party modeling solution that is prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate its sensitivity to changing interest rates, given the Bank’s business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. In order to better manage its interest rate risk, on October 12, 2023 the Bank entered into two interest rate swap transactions with Goldman Sachs Bank USA. One interest rate swap is for a period of two years effective October 12, 2023 and terminates on November 1, 2025 with a notional amount of $150.0 million. The Bank will pay a fixed rate of interest of 4.885% and receive the SOFR rate. The other interest rate swap is for a period of three years effective October 12, 2023 and terminates on November 1, 2026 with a notional amount of $100.0 million. The Bank will pay a fixed rate of interest of 4.62% and receive the SOFR rate. Net Interest Income Simulation Models . Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software that measures the Bank’s earnings through simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, the Bank has policy guidelines for earnings risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest 65 rates. As of September 30, 2023, in the event of an instantaneous upward and downward change in rates from management's interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated: Net Interest Income Year 1 Change Rate Shift (1) Year 1 Forecast from Level (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 52,670 (20.48%) +300 56,037 (15.39%) +200 59,438 (10.26%) +100 62,864 (5.09%) Level 66,232 — % -100 69,788 5.37% -200 72,469 9.42% -300 74,630 12.68% -400 76,354 15.28% Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The behavior of the deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in the projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the benefit in those scenarios. At September 30, 2023, the earnings simulation model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Economic Value of Equity Model . While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to net interest income, the Economic Value of Equity Model (“EVE”) measures estimated changes to the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. Rates are then shocked as prescribed by the Interest Rate Risk Policy to measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Interest Rate Risk Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At September 30, 2023, the EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: EVE as a Percentage of Present Value of Assets (3) Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Increase Change in Interest Estimated EVE EVE (Decrease) Rates (basis points) (1) EVE (2) Amount Percent Ratio (4) (basis points) (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 410,522 $ (84,260 ) (17.03 %) 17.25 % (1,703 ) +300 434,261 (60,521 ) (12.23 %) 17.88 % (1,223 ) +200 458,948 (35,834 ) (7.24 %) 18.52 % (724 ) +100 484,525 (10,257 ) (2.07 %) 19.16 % (207 ) Level 494,782 — — % 19.28 % — -100 532,818 38,036 7.69 % 20.24 % 769 -200 554,253 59,471 12.02 % 20.64 % 1,202 -300 572,245 77,463 15.66 % 20.90 % 1,566 -400 605,075 110,293 22.29 % 21.55 % 2,229 Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the 66 discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2023, the EVE model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors’ approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Most Likely Earnings Simulation Models . Management also analyzes a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress the balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management and weighted to determine the most likely result. These processes assist management to better anticipate financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to review other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. The Asset/Liability Committee reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing and capital policies. Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in the Bank’s regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behaviors that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from the Bank’s historical studies of financial instruments and the best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into Bank’s asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare its results to other banks. The Asset/Liability Management Committee may determine that the Company should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and its conclusions regarding interest rate fluctuations in future periods. The historically low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response the turmoil resulting from COVID-19 pandemic has ended. The Federal Reserve Board increased the benchmark federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.25% - 5.50% at its July 26, 2023 mee ting . The Federal Reserve Board has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. GAP Analysis . In addition, management analyzes interest rate sensitivity by monitoring the Bank’s interest rate sensitivity ""gap."" The interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing-liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period, and a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period. 67 The following table sets forth the Company’s interest-earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities at September 30, 2023, which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown based upon certain assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at September 30, 2023, on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments. The loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable-rate loans.

Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and EVE tables presented assume that the composition of the interest-sensitive assets 68 and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income and EVE tables provide an indication of the interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and EVE and will differ from actual results. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table. Interest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of loans, deposits and borrowings. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity describes the ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Company’s customers and to fund current and future planned expenditures. The primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and available-for-sale securities and proceeds from the sale of loans. The Bank also has access to borrow from the FHLBNY and the FRBNY. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Bank had $675.1 million and $517.4 million, respectively, of term and overnight outstanding advances from the FHLBNY and the FRBNY, and also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through letters of credit of up to $1.0 million as of September 30, 2023 and $21.5 million as of December 31, 2022. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there was eligible collateral of approximately $853.6 million and $478.8 million, respectively, in mortgage loans available to secure advances from the FHLBNY. The Bank also has two unsecured lines of credit of $75.0 million and $90.0 million, respectively, with two correspondent banks, of which there was none outstanding at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Bank did not have any outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements with brokers as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Although maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The most liquid assets are cash and interest-bearing deposits in banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities was ($25.4) million and $14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations, purchases of new securities, and purchase of equipment offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from maturities, calls and principal repayments on securities was ($207.3) million and ($641.1) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting of activities in borrowing and deposit accounts, was $295.4 million and $535.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Bank’s management took steps to enhance the Company’s liquidity position by increasing its on balance sheet cash and cash equivalents position in order to meet unforeseen liquidity events and to fund upcoming funding needs. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, all regulatory capital requirements were met, resulting in the Company and the Bank being categorized as well capitalized at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change this categorization. Material Cash Requirements Commitments . As a financial services provider, the Company routinely is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. Although these contractual obligations represent the Company’s future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans originated. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans and extend credit of $507.3 million and $281.3 million, respectively. It is anticipated that the Company will have sufficient funds available to meet its current lending commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in 2023 totaled $203.7 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing time deposits will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits are not retained, the Company may utilize FHLBNY advances, unsecured credit lines with correspondent banks, or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. 69 The Company adopted a share repurchase program effective May 16, 2023 which was completed in August 2023. Under the repurchase program, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to 1,235,000 shares of the Company's stock or approximately 5% of the Company's then current issued and outstanding shares. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased a total of 1,235,000 shares of the Company's common stock. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 1,233,111 shares and 1,976 shares, respectively, were held as treasury stock as a result of share buy-back and restricted stock units vested during 2023 and restricted stock units vested during 2022, respectively. Contractual Obligations . In the ordinary course of its operations, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. There have been no material changes in the Company’s material cash requirements under its contractual obligations as discussed in its most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Other Material Cash Requirements. In addition to contractual obligations, the Company’s material cash requirements also includes compensation and benefits expenses for its employees, which were $22.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company also has material cash requirements for occupancy and equipment expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization of $1.4 million, related to rental expenses, general maintenance and cleaning supplies, guard services, software licenses and other miscellaneous expenses, which were $9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part I, Item 2 of this report under “Management of Market Risk”. Item 4.

Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summa ry of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Consolidation: Ponce Financial Group, Inc. (hereafter referred to as “we,” “our,” “us,” “Ponce Financial Group, Inc.,” or the “Company”) is the holding company of Ponce Bank (“Ponce Bank” or the “Bank”), a federally chartered stock savings association. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary Ponce Bank (the “Bank”) and the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Ponce De Leon Mortgage Corp., which is a mortgage banking entity. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Nature of Operations: The Company is a savings and loan holding company. The Company is subject to the regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Company’s business is conducted through the administrative office and 13 full service banking and 6 mortgage loan offices. The banking offices are located in New York City – the Bronx ( 4 branches), Queens ( 3 branches), Brooklyn ( 3 branches), Manhattan ( 2 branches) and Union City ( 1 branch), New Jersey. The mortgage loan offices are located in Queens ( 4 ) and Brooklyn ( 1 ), New York and Bergenfield ( 1 ), New Jersey. The Company’s primary market area currently consists of the New York City metropolitan area. The Bank is a federally chartered stock savings association headquartered in the Bronx, New York. It was originally chartered in 1960 as a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association under the name Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1985, the Bank changed its name to “Ponce De Leon Federal Savings Bank.” In 1997, the Bank changed its name again to “Ponce De Leon Federal Bank.” Upon the completion of its reorganization into a mutual holding company structure in September of 2017, the assets and liabilities of Ponce De Leon Federal Bank were transferred to and assumed by the Bank. The Bank is a Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), a Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”), and a certified Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lender. The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). The Bank’s business primarily consists of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in mortgage loans, consisting of one-to-four family residential (both investor-owned and owner-occupied), multifamily residential, nonresidential properties and construction and land, and, to a lesser extent, in business and consumer loans. The Bank also invests in securities, which have historically consisted of U.S. government and federal agency securities and securities issued by government-sponsored or owned enterprises, mortgage-backed securities and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the “FHLBNY”) stock. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts, including demand, savings, money markets and certificates of deposit accounts. Risks and Uncertainties: Inflation and interest rates may continue to adversely impact several industries within our geographic footprint and impair the ability of the Company’s customers to fulfill their contractual obligations to the Company. This could cause the Company to experience adverse effects on its business operations, loan portfolio, financial condition, and results of operations. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, total interest expenses increased $ 22.5 million, or 670.6 %, to $ 25.9 million when compared to $ 3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Use of Estimates : In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, the valuation of loans held for sale, the valuation of deferred tax assets and investment securities and the estimates relating to the valuation for share-based awards. Interim Financial Statements : The interim consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2023, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 are unaudited and reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 6 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 2023 , are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2023, or any other period. Significant Group Concentrations of Credit Risk : Most of the Bank's activities are with customers located within New York City. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the Bank's loan portfolio and the ability of Mortgage World, a division of the Bank, to sell originated loans in the secondary markets are susceptible to changes in the local market conditions. Note 3 discusses the types of securities in which the Bank invests. Notes 4 and 12 discuss the types of lending that the Bank engages in, and other concentrations. Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts due from banks (including items in process of clearing). For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash flows from loans originated by the Company, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions, and deposits are reported net. Included in cash and cash equivalents are restricted cash from escrows and good faith deposits. Escrows consist of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) upfront mortgage insurance premiums and escrows on unsold mortgages that are held on behalf of borrowers. Good faith deposits consist of deposits received from commercial loan customers for use in various disbursements relating to the closing of a commercial loan. Securities : Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the date individual investment securities are acquired, and the appropriateness of such classification is reassessed at each statement of financial condition date. Debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as ""held-to-maturity"" and recorded at amortized cost. Trading securities, if any, are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings. Securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading, are classified as ""available-for-sale"" and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. Held-to maturity securities : Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Topic 326, ""Financial Instruments - Credit Losses"" which replaced the previously existing U.S. GAAP ""incurred loss"" approach to ""expected credit losses"" approach, which is referred as Current Expected Credit Losses (""CECL""). CECL modifies the accounting of impairment on held-for-sale debt securities by recognizing a credit loss through an allowance for credit losses. The Company methodology to measure the allowance for credit loss (""ACL"") incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information to assess lifetime expected credit losses at the portfolio level. The quantitative component includes the calculation of loss rates using an open pool method. The Company differentiates its loss-rate method for a pool of held-to-maturity corporate securities by looking to publicly available historical default and recovery statistics based on the attributes of issuer type, rating category and time to maturity. The Company measures expected credit losses of these financial assets by applying loss rates to the amortized cost basis of each asset taking into consideration amortization, prepayment and default assumptions. The Company considers qualitative adjustments to expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. Qualitative factor adjustments may increase or decrease management's estimate of expected credit losses. Adjustments will not be made for information that has already been considered and included in the quantitative allowance. Available-for-sale securities : The impairment model for available-for-sale (""AFS"") debt securities differs from the CECL approach utilized by held-to-maturity (""HTM"") debt securities since AFS debt securities are measured at fair value rather than amortized cost. For AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Bank first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. 7 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the available-for-sale securities for impairment. Securities that are in an unrealized loss position are reviewed to determine if a securities credit loss exists based on certain quantitative and qualitative factors. The primary factors considered in evaluating whether an impairment exists include: (a) the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, (b) the financial condition, credit rating and future prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, and (d) whether the Company intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not the Company will not be required to sell the security. If a determination is made that a security is impaired, the Company will estimate the amount of the unrealized loss that is attributable to credit and all other non-credit related factors. The credit related component will be recognized as a securities credit loss as a provision expense through the establishment of an allowance for available for sale securities. The securities credit loss expense will be limited to the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and fair value and any future changes may be reversed, limited to the amount previously expensed in the period they occur. The non-credit related component will be recorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The evaluation of securities for impairment is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the estimated fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include change in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition and/or future prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads, and the expected recovery period. See Note 3 (""Securities"") of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock : The Bank is a member of the FHLBNY. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. FHLBNY stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. Loans Receivable : Loans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at current unpaid principal balances, net of the allowance for credit losses on loans and including net deferred loan origination fees and costs. Interest income is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the interest method without anticipating prepayments. A loan is moved to nonaccrual status in accordance with the Company’s policy typically after 90 days of non-payment. The accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is generally discontinued at the time the loan becomes 90 days past due unless the loan is well-secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than 90 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All nonaccrual loans are considered impaired loans. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual are reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash basis or recorded against principal balances, until qualifying for return to accrual. Cash basis interest recognition is only applied on nonaccrual loans with a sufficient collateral margin to ensure no doubt with respect to the collectability of principal. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and remain current for a period of time (typically six months) and future payments are reasonably assured. Accrued interest receivable is closely monitored for collectability and will be charged-off in a timely manner if deemed uncollectable. In the event that collection of principal becomes uncertain, the Company has policies in place to write-off accrued interest receivable by reversing interest income in a timely manner. Therefore, the Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis and therefore excludes it from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”). Allowance for Credit Losses : The ACL on loans is management's estimate of expected credit losses over the expected life of the loans at the reporting date. The ACL on loans is increased through a provision for credit losses (“PCL”) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and by recoveries of amounts previously charged off. The ACL on loans is reduced by charge-offs on loans. Loan charge-offs are recognized when Management believes the collectability of the principal balance outstanding is unlikely. Full or partial charge-offs on collateral-dependent individually analyzed loans are generally recognized when the collateral is deemed to be insufficient to support the carrying value of the loan. According to ASC 326-20-30-9, estimating expected credit losses is highly judgmental and generally will require Ponce Bank to make specific judgments. One of these specific judgments around how Ponce Bank will make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts of expected credit losses. Ponce Bank uses Federal Open Market Committee to obtain various forecasts for unemployment rate, national gross domestic product and the National Consumer Price Index. Ponce Bank has elected to forecast the first four quarters of the credit loss estimate and revert to a long-run average of each considered economic factor as permitted in ASC 326-20-30-9. 8 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The level of the ACL on loans is based on Management's ongoing review of all relevant information, from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions and reasonable forecast. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for calculation of probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default and the estimation of expected credit losses. As discussed further below, adjustments to historical information are made for differences in specific risk characteristics, such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term, as well as for changes in environmental conditions, that may not be reflected in historical loss rates. Management employs a process and methodology to estimate the ACL on loans that evaluates both quantitative and qualitative factors. Under ASC 326-20-30-2 and 326-20-55-5, Ponce Bank should aggregate financial assets on the basis of similar risk characteristics. Management selected a Call Code segmentation, as based on the Bank's call report. Management’s criteria for determining an appropriate segmentation (1) groups loans based on similar risk characteristics; (2) allows for mapping and utilization/application of publicly available external information (Call Report Filings); (3) allows for mapping and utilization/application of publicly available external information; (4) federal call code is granular enough to accommodate enough to accommodate a “like-kind” notion, yet broad enough to maintain statistical relevance and/or a meaningful number of loan observations within material segments and (5) federal call code designation is identifiable throughout historical data sets, which is critical component of segmentation selection. Quantitative loss factors are also supplemented by certain qualitative risk factors reflecting Management's view of how losses may vary from those represented by quantitative loss rates. These qualitative risk factors include: (1) changes in lending policies, procedures and strategies including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses; (2) economic conditions such as the Bank’s market area, customer demographics, portfolio composition, along with national indicators considered impactful to the model; (3) changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio; (4) credit and lending staff/administration; (5) problem with loan trends; (6) concentrations; (7) loan review results; (8) collateral values and regulatory and business environment. Because the methodology is based upon historical experience and trends, current economic data, reasonable and supportable forecasts, as well as Management's judgment, factors may arise that result in different estimations. Deteriorating conditions or assumptions could lead to further increases in the ACL on loans. The ACL on loans is determined by an estimate of future credit losses, and ultimate losses may vary from Management's estimate. Allowances for Credit Losses on Unfunded Commitments : The ACL on unfunded commitments is Management's estimate of expected credit losses over the expected credit losses over the expected contractual term (or life) in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditional cancellable by the Company. For each portfolio, estimated loss rates and funding factors are applied to the corresponding balance of unfunded commitments and the estimated loss rates applied to unfunded commitments are the same quantitative and qualitative loss rates applied to the corresponding on-balance sheet amounts in determining the ACL on loans. The estimated funding factor applied to unfunded commitments represents the likelihood that the funding will occur and is based upon the Company's average historical utilization rate each portfolio. The ACL on unfunded commitments in included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Conditions. The ACL on unfunded commitments is adjusted through non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value : Loans held for sale, at fair value, include residential mortgages that were originated in accordance with secondary market pricing and underwriting standards. These loans are loans originated by the Bank’s Mortgage World division and the Company intends to sell these loans on the secondary market. Loans held for sale are carried at fair value under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. The gains or losses for the changes in fair value of these loans are included in income on sale of loans on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale measured under the fair value option is calculated based on the principal amount of the loan and is included in interest loans receivable on the consolidated statements of operations. At June 30, 2023 and at December 31, 2022 , 8 loans and 4 loans related to Mortgage World in the amount of $ 5.9 million and $ 2.0 million, respectively, were held for sale. At June 30, 2023 the Bank also had one construction loan in the amount of $ 4.1 million classified as held for sale in its portfolio. Derivative Financial Instruments : The Company, through the Bank’s Mortgage World division, uses derivative financial instruments as a part of its price risk management activities. All such derivative financial instruments are designated as free-standing derivative instruments. In accordance with FASB ASC 815-25, Derivatives and Hedging , all derivative instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their fair value. Change in the fair value of these derivatives is reported in current period earnings. Additionally, to facilitate the sale of mortgage loans, the Bank, through its Mortgage World division, may enter into forward sale positions on securities, and mandatory delivery positions. Exposure to losses or gains on these positions is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid. As of June 30, 2023 , the Company did not enter into any forward sale or mandatory delivery positions on their financial instruments. 9 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The Company’s revenue from contracts with customers in the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contract with Customers , is recognized within noninterest income. ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Management determined the revenue streams impacted by ASC 606 included those related to service charges on deposit accounts, ATM and card fees and other services fees. The Company’s revenue recognition pattern for these revenue streams did not change from current practice. The Company's primary sources of revenue are interest income on financial assets and income from mortgage banking activities, which are explicitly excluded from the scope of ASC 606. Transfers of Financial Assets : Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when all of the components meet the definition of a participating interest and when control over the assets has been surrendered. A participating interest generally represents (1) a proportionate (pro rata) ownership interest in an entire financial asset, (2) a relationship where from the date of transfer all cash flows received from the entire financial asset are divided proportionately among the participating interest holders in an amount equal to their share of ownership, (3) the priority of cash flows has certain characteristics, including no reduction in priority, subordination of interest, or recourse to the transferor other than standard representation or warranties, and (4) no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Bank, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Bank does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either (a) an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity or (b) the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a clean-up call. Premises and Equipment : Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed and charged to operations using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows: Years Buildings 39 Building improvements 15 - 39 Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 3 - 10 Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated economic lives or the related lease terms, including extensions expected to be exercised. Gains and losses on dispositions are recognized upon realization. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and improvements are capitalized. Leasehold improvements in process are not amortized until the assets are placed in operation. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets : Long-lived assets, including premises and leasehold improvements, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated by that review, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to noninterest expense. Leases : The Company leases office space and certain equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements and determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company does not currently have any financing lease arrangements. Right of use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right of use assets are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term adjusted for initial direct costs, if any, and lease incentives received or deemed probable of being received. The Company uses the rate implicit in the lease if it is readily determinable or otherwise the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The implicit rates of Company leases are not readily determinable and accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date for all leases. The Company's incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms and in a similar economic environment. The Company uses its FHLBNY borrowing rate based on the information available on the commencement date plus a spread of 2.50 % in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in “Occupancy and equipment” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Some of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation which are accounted for as variable lease amounts but are not reflected as a component of the Company’s lease liability. Certain leases also require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises or equipment which are also not reflected as a component of the Company’s lease liability 10 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Other Real Estate Owned : Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) represents properties acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure or other proceedings. OREO is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated disposal costs, at the date of foreclosure, which establishes a new cost basis. After foreclosure, the properties are held for sale and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs of disposal. Any write-down to fair value, at the time of transfer to OREO, is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Properties are evaluated regularly to ensure that the recorded amounts are supported by current fair values and charges against earnings are recorded as necessary to reduce the carrying amount to fair value, less estimated costs to dispose. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property are capitalized, subject to the limit of fair value of the OREO, while costs relating to holding the property are expensed. Gains or losses are included in operations upon disposal. Income Taxes : The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income, in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 % likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, would be classified as additional provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. Related Party Transactions : Directors and officers of the Company and their affiliates have been customers of and have had transactions with the Company, and it is expected that such persons will continue to have such transactions in the future. Management believes that all deposit accounts, loans, services and commitments comprising such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other customers who are not directors or officers. In the opinion of management, the transactions with related parties did not involve more than normal risk of collectability, nor favored treatment or terms, nor present other unfavorable features. Note 16 contains details regarding related party transactions. Employee Benefit Plans: The Company maintains a KSOP, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) provisions incorporated, a Long-Term Incentive Plan that includes grants of restricted stock units and stock options, and a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”). KSOP, the Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions: Compensation expense is recorded as shares are committed to be released with a corresponding credit to unearned KSOP equity account at the average fair market value of the shares during the period and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the service period based upon management’s estimate of the number of shares expected to be allocated by the KSOP. The difference between the average fair market value and the cost of the shares allocated by the KSOP is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in-capital. Unallocated common shares held by the Company’s KSOP are shown as a reduction in stockholders’ equity and are excluded from weighted-average common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted earnings per share calculations until they are committed to be released. The 401(k) provisions provide for elective employee/participant deferrals of income. Discretionary matching, profit-sharing, and safe harbor contributions, not to exceed 4 % of employee compensation and profit-sharing contributions may be provided. Stock Options: The Company recognizes the value of shared-based payment transactions as compensation costs in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. The fair value of the share-based payments for 11 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur during the period. Restricted Stock Units: The Company recognizes compensation cost related to restricted stock units based on the market price of the stock units at the grant date over the vesting period. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determines the fair value of restricted stock units. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Comprehensive Income (Loss): Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss), which are both recognized as separate components of stockholder’s equity. Other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale. Loss Contingencies : Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are any such matters that will have a material effect on the operations and financial position of the Company. Fair Value of Financial Instruments : Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in Note 13. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates. Segment Reporting : Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the “CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment and one reportable segment. Loan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments : Financial instruments include off‑balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. Earnings (Loss) per Share (“EPS”) : Basic EPS represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding, plus the effect of potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Basic weighted common shares outstanding is weighted average common shares outstanding less weighted average unallocated ESOP shares. Treasury Stock : Shares repurchased under the Company’s share repurchase programs were purchased in open-market transactions and are held as treasury stock. The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of stockholders’ equity. Reclassification of Prior Periods Presentation : Certain prior periods amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reporting results of operations and did not affect previously reported amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations 12 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted: In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) . ” This ASU provides optional means and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or other reference rates expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU were initially effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, ""Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date (Topic 848) . "" This ASU extends the sunset (or expiration) date of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 848 to December 31, 2024. This gives reporting entities two additional years to apply the accounting relief provided under ASC Topic 848 for matters related to reference rate reform. ASU 2022-06 is effective for all reporting entities immediately upon issuance and must be applied on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Note 2. Preferred Stock Issuance; Plan of Conversion and Stock Offering Preferred Stock Issuance On June 7, 2022, the Company‎ closed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 225,000 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A‎, par value $ 0.01 (the “Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price equal to $ 225.0 million in cash, to the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) pursuant to the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”).‎ The holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a dividend payable in cash quarterly at an annual rate dependent on certain factors as reported by the Company to Treasury in a quarterly supplemental report. The initial dividend rate is zero percent for the first two years after issuance, and thereafter the floor dividend rate is 0.50 % and the ceiling dividend rate is 2.00 %. After 10 years of issuance, the perpetual dividend rate in effect, will be determined based on said floor and ceiling. The actual dividend rate that will be paid by the Company on the Preferred Stock cannot be determined at this time. The ECIP investment by the Treasury is part of a program to invest over $ 8.7 billion into Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) or ‎Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), of which Ponce Bank is both. The ECIP is intended to incentivize CDFIs and MDIs to provide loans, grants, ‎and forbearance to small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers in low-income and underserved communities that may have been ‎disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.‎ In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $ 1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. Conversion, Reorganization and Common Stock Offering On May 25, 2021, Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company and PDL Community Bancorp, the then holding company for Ponce Bank and Mortgage World Bankers, Inc., announced that their Boards of Directors had unanimously adopted a Plan of Conversion and Reorganization (the “Plan”) pursuant to which Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company and PDL Community Bancorp reorganized into a new stock holding company and conducted a second-step stock offering of new shares of common stock. On January 26, 2022, Mortgage World transferred its assets and liabilities to Ponce Bank and ceased operating as an independent mortgage banking entity. Mortgage World’s business is now conducted as a division of Ponce Bank. On January 27, 2022, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and PDL Community Bancorp announced that the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from the mutual to stock form of organization and related stock offering was consummated at the close of business. As a result of the closing of the conversion and reorganization and stock offering, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. is now the holding company for Ponce Bank. Ponce Bank’s former mutual holding companies, PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, have ceased to exist. PDL Community Bancorp’s stock ceased trading at the close of the market on January 27, 2022. Ponce Financial Group, Inc.’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the same trading symbol “PDLB” on January 28, 2022. As a result of the conversion and reorganization, each issued and outstanding share of PDL Community Bancorp common stock was converted into the right to receive 1.3952 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. Cash was paid in lieu of any fractional shares based on the sale price in the offering of $ 10.00 per share. Ponce Financial Group Inc.’s total issued and outstanding shares on January 28, 2022 was 24,711,834 shares. All shares of treasury stock of PDL Community Bancorp were eliminated on January 27, 2022. 13 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) On January 27, 2022, the Company made a $ 5.0 million in contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation as part of the conversion and reorganization, which is included in the non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Note 3. Securities Adoption of Topic 326 Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the provisions of Topic 326 using the modified retrospective method.

Management reviewed the financial condition of the entities underlying the securities at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The unrealized losses related to the Company debt securities were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies. The Company does not believe that the debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2023 represents a credit loss impairment. The gross unrealized loss positions related to mortgage-backed securities and other obligations issued by the U.S. government agencies or U.S. 16 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) government-sponsored enterprises carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. Total gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities. Management reviewed the collectability of the corporate bonds taking into consideration of such factors as the financial condition of the issuers, reported regulatory capital ratios of the issuers, credit ratings, including ratings in effect as of the reporting date. Management believes the unrealized losses on the corporate bonds are primarily attributable to changes in the interest rates and not changes in the credit quality of the issuers of the corporate bonds. The following is a summary of maturities of securities at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Amounts are shown by contractual maturity.

The Company primarily grants loans secured by real estate to individuals and businesses pursuant to an established credit policy applicable to each type of lending activity in which it engages. Although collateral provides assurance as a secondary source of repayment, the Company ordinarily requires the primary source of repayment to be based on the borrowers’ ability to generate continuing cash flows. The Company also evaluates the collateral and creditworthiness of each customer. The credit policy provides that depending on the borrowers’ creditworthiness and type of collateral, credit may be extended up to predetermined percentages of the market value of the collateral or on an unsecured basis. Real estate is the primary form of collateral. Other important forms of collateral are time deposits and marketable securities. For disclosures related to the allowance for credit losses and credit quality, the Company does not have any disaggregated classes of loans below the segment level. Credit-Quality Indicators : Internally assigned risk ratings are used as credit-quality indicators, which are reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. The objectives of the Company’s risk-rating system are to provide the Board of Directors and senior management with an objective assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio, to promptly and accurately identify loans with well-defined credit weaknesses so that timely action can be taken to minimize credit loss, to identify relevant trends affecting the collectability of the loan portfolio, to isolate potential problem areas and to provide essential information for determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Below are the definitions of the internally assigned risk ratings: 19 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Loans within the top four categories above are considered pass rated, as commonly defined. Risk ratings are assigned as necessary to differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised to reflect changes in the borrowers’ financial condition and outlook, debt service coverage capability, repayment performance, collateral value and coverage as well as other considerations.

according to the contractual terms of the related loan agreements. Impaired loans are identified by applying normal loan review procedures in accordance with the allowance for credit losses methodology. Management periodically assesses loans to determine whether impairment exists. Any loan that is, or will potentially be, no longer performing in accordance with the terms of the original loan contract is evaluated to determine impairment. 23 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following information relates to impaired loans as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022: Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized As of and For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on a Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential $ 2,990 $ 2,533 $ 455 $ 2,988 $ 73 $ 7,794 $ 43 Multifamily residential 1,435 1,435 — 1,435 — 958 — Nonresidential properties — — — — — 531 — Construction and land 7,567 7,621 — 7,621 — 9,031 — Nonmortgage loans: Business — — — — — 20 — Consumer — — — — — — Total $ 11,992 $ 11,589 $ 455 $ 12,044 $ 73 $ 18,334 $ 43 Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized As of and For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on a Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential $ 11,136 $ 8,264 $ 2,571 $ 10,835 $ 182 $ 11,572 $ 146 Multifamily residential — — — — — 946 — Nonresidential properties 2,007 1,626 356 1,982 41 2,865 44 Construction and land 10,817 10,817 — 10,817 — 3,371 55 Nonmortgage loans: Business — — — — — 4 — Consumer — — — — — 24 — Total $ 23,960 $ 20,707 $ 2,927 $ 23,634 $ 223 $ 18,782 $ 245 Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized As of and for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on a Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential $ 9,986 $ 7,827 $ 1,757 $ 9,584 $ 159 $ 11,072 $ 307 Multifamily residential — — — — — 630 — Nonresidential properties 843 457 344 801 37 1,930 30 Construction and land 7,567 7,567 — 7,567 — 6,408 — Nonmortgage loans: Business — — — — — 3 — Consumer — — — — — — — Total $ 18,396 $ 15,851 $ 2,101 $ 17,952 $ 196 $ 20,043 $ 337 Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, the Company classified certain loans as troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) loans when credit terms to a borrower in financial difficulty were modified, in accordance with ASC 310-40. With the adoption of ASU 2022-02 as of January 1, 2023, the Company has ceased to recognize or measure for new TDRs but those existing at December 31, 2022 will remain until settled. During the year ended December 31, 2022, there were no loans restructured as a troubled debt restructuring. At December 31, 2022, there were 23 troubled debt restructured loans totaling $ 6.6 million of which $ 4.2 million are on accrual status. There were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. The 24 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) financial impact from the concessions made represents specific impairment reserves on these loans, which aggregated to $ 0.2 million December 31, 2022. Loans Held for Sale at Fair Value At June 30, 2023 and at December 31, 2022 , 8 loans and 4 loans related to Mortgage World in the amount of $ 5.9 million and $ 2.0 million, respectively, were held for sale and accounted for under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. At June 30, 2023 the Bank also had one construction loan in the amount of $ 4.1 million classified as held-for-sale in its portfolio. Write-off and write-down of Microloans In 2020, the Company entered into a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain. Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to $ 1,500 and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originates and services these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan is found to be fraudulent, becomes 90 days delinquent upon 90 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.” At December 31, 2022, the Bank had 27,886 Grain microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $ 18.2 million and which were performing, in management's opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by a $ 15.4 million allowance for loan losses, resulting in $ 2.8 million in Grain microloans, net of allowance for loan losses. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had 19,701 Grain microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $ 11.2 million and which were performing, in management’s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by an $ 9.8 million allowance for credit losses, resulting in $ 1.4 million in Grain microloans. Since the beginning of the Bank’s agreement with Grain and through June 30, 2023, 45,322 microloans amounting to $ 24.3 million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain. The Company has written-down a total of $ 15.7 million, net of recoveries, of the Grain Receivable and received $ 6.8 million in cash from Grain and through the application of security deposits connected to fraudulent loan accounts. The Bank also opted to use the $ 1.8 million grant it received from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Rapid Response ‎Program to defray the Grain Receivable. The application of those amounts resulted in no net receivable. Additionally, the Company wrote-off its equity investment in Grain of $ 1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, the Company’s total exposure to Grain was $ 1.4 million of the remaining microloans, net of allowance for credit losses, excluding $ 2.4 million of unused commitments available to Grain borrowers and $ 1.3 million of security deposits by Grain borrowers. The $ 1.3 million of recoveries for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the $ 9.6 million write-off for the six months ended June 30, 2022 related to Grain is included in non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $ 1.3 million of recoveries for the six months ended June 30, 2023, $ 0.6 million were payments received from Grain on the Grain Receivable and the remainder were payments from Grain borrowers. 25 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Grain Technology, Inc.

Excludes $ 1.3 million of security deposits by Grain originated borrowers reported in deposits in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Conditions. Off-Balance Sheet Credit Losses Also included within the scope of the CECL standard are off-balance sheet loan commitments, which includes the unfunded portion of committed lines of credit and construction loans. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the company is exposed to credit risk through a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The Company uses similar assumptions and risk factors that are developed for collectively evaluated financing receivables. This estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments to be funded over its estimated life. At June 30, 2023, the allowance for off-balance sheet credit losses was $ 2.8 million, which is included in the ""Other liabilities"" on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company had $ 1.5 million in credit loss provision for off-balance-sheet items, which are included in ""Provision for contingencies"" on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 consists of the following: For the Three Months Ended June 30, For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in thousands) Federal: Current $ ( 443 ) $ ( 842 ) $ ( 403 ) $ ( 1,895 ) Deferred ( 73 ) 418 32 ( 1,297 ) ( 516 ) ( 424 ) ( 371 ) ( 3,192 ) State and local: Current 423 378 853 573 Deferred ( 575 ) ( 1,981 ) ( 727 ) ( 2,524 ) ( 152 ) ( 1,603 ) 126 ( 1,951 ) Valuation allowance 453 1,539 576 1,707 Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ ( 215 ) $ ( 488 ) $ 331 $ ( 3,436 ) 30 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Total income tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21 % for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to income before income taxes as a result of the following: For the Three Months Ended June 30, For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in thousands) Income tax, at federal rate $ ( 63 ) $ 59 $ 121 $ ( 1,992 ) State and local tax, net of federal taxes ( 120 ) ( 1,266 ) 100 ( 1,541 ) Valuation allowance, net of the federal benefit 453 1,539 576 1,707 Other ( 485 ) ( 820 ) ( 466 ) ( 1,610 ) $ ( 215 ) $ ( 488 ) $ 331 $ ( 3,436 ) Management maintains a valuation allowance against its net New York State and New York City deferred tax assets as it is unlikely these deferred tax assets will be utilized to reduce the Company's tax liability in future years. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the valuation allowance increased by $ 0.6 million and $ 1.7 million, respectively. In 2022, the Company generated large net operating losses in New York State and New York City which in turn increased the 2022 valuation allowance. Management has determined that it is not required to establish a valuation allowance against any other deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully utilized in future periods. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers the scheduled reversal of the deferred tax liabilities, the level of historical taxable income, and the projected future taxable income over the periods that the temporary differences comprising the deferred tax assets will be deductible. For federal income tax purposes, a financial institution may carry net operating losses (“NOLs”) to forward tax years indefinitely. The use of NOLs to offset income is limited to 80 %. At June 30, 2023 , the Bank had a federal NOL carryforward of $ 11.6 million. The state and city of New York allow for a three-year carryback period and carryforward period of twenty years on NOLs generated on or after tax year 2015. For tax years prior to 2015, no carryback period is allowed. Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, has pre-2015 carryforwards of $ 0.6 million for New York State purposes and $ 0.5 million for New York City purposes. Furthermore, there are post-2015 carryforwards available of $ 65.8 million for New York State purposes and $ 36.7 million for New York City purposes. Finally, for New Jersey purposes, losses may only be carried forward 20 years, with no allowable carryback period. At June 30, 2023 , the Bank had a New Jersey NOL carryforward of $ 0.4 million. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits recorded. The Company does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase in the next twelve months. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax, New York State income tax, Connecticut income tax, New Jersey income tax, Florida income tax, Pennsylvania income tax and New York City income tax. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2019. 31 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are presented below: June 30, December 31, 2023 2022 (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan losses $ 9,222 $ 11,324 Interest on nonaccrual loans 619 317 Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities 4,760 4,777 Amortization of intangible assets 23 32 Operating lease liabilities 11,037 11,304 Net operating losses 9,284 9,119 Charitable contribution carryforward 1,881 1,859 Compensation and benefits 1,015 562 Other 1,646 478 Total gross deferred tax assets 39,487 39,772 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation of premises and equipment 1,049 1,049 Right of use assets 10,617 10,941 Deferred loan fees 347 671 Other 29 29 Total gross deferred tax liabilities 12,042 12,690 Valuation allowance 11,521 10,945 Net deferred tax assets $ 15,924 $ 16,137 Note 10.

An employee must attain the age of 21 and will be eligible to participate in the 401(k) features of the KSOP in the quarter following thirty days of service and the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (""ESOP"") feature of the KSOP upon the first entry date commencing on or after the eligible employee’s completion of one year of service. Employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan at the beginning of each quarter (January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1). 401(k) Component : Under the 401(k) features of the KSOP (“401(k) Component”), a participant may elect to defer, on a pre-tax basis, the maximum amount as permitted by the Internal Revenue Code. For 2023, the salary deferral contribution limit was $ 22,500 ; provided, however, that a participant over age 50 may contribute an additional $ 7,500 to the 401(k) for a total of $ 30,000 . In addition to salary deferral contributions, Ponce Bank may make discretionary matching contributions, discretionary profit-sharing contributions or safe harbor contributions to the 401(k) Component. Discretionary matching contributions are allocated on the basis of salary deferral contributions. Discretionary profit-sharing contributions are based on three classifications set forth in the 401(k) feature (i) Class A — Chairman, President, and Executive Vice Presidents; (ii) Class B — Senior Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents and Assistant Vice Presidents; and (iii) Class C — all other eligible employees. The contribution for a class will be the same percentage of compensation for all participants in that class. If Ponce Bank decides to make a safe harbor contribution for a plan year, each participant will receive a contribution equal to 3 % of his or her compensation for the plan year. 32 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) A participant is always 100 % vested in his or her salary deferral contributions and safe harbor contributions. Discretionary matching and profit-sharing contributions are 20 % vested after two years of service, plus an additional 20 % for each additional year of service; so all participants are fully vested in such contributions after six years of service. Participants also will become fully vested in his or her account balance in the 401(k) Component automatically upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the KSOP. Generally, participants will receive distributions from the KSOP upon separation from service in accordance with the terms of the governing document. ESOP Component: On September 29, 2017, in connection with the Bank’s reorganization into the mutual holding company form of organization, the ESOP trustee purchased, on behalf of the ESOP, 723,751 shares of PDL Community Bancorp common stock. The ESOP funded its stock purchase with a loan (“First ESOP loan”) from PDL Community Bancorp in the amount of $ 7.2 million, which was equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The First ESOP loan is being repaid principally through Ponce Bank’s contributions to the ESOP over the 15 -year term of such loan. The interest rate for the First ESOP loan is 2.60 %. On January 27, 2022, concurrent with the completion of the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from a mutual form to a stock form of organization and the merger of PDL Community Bancorp with and into Ponce Financial Group, Inc., the shares of PDL Community Bancorp common stock held by the KSOP were converted into 977,880 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. On January 27, 2022, the KSOP trustee purchased, on behalf of the ESOP feature of the KSOP (“ESOP Component”), an additional 1,097,353 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock, or 4.44 % of the total number of shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock outstanding on January 27, 2022 (including shares issued to the Foundation). The KSOP funded this stock purchase with a loan (“Second ESOP loan”) from Ponce Financial Group, Inc. in the amount of $ 11.0 million, which was equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The Second ESOP loan is being repaid principally through Ponce Bank’s contributions to the ESOP Component over the 15 -year term of such loan. The interest rate for the Second ESOP loan is 1.82 %. The trustee of the trust funding the KSOP holds the shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock purchased by the KSOP in an unallocated suspense account, and shares will be released from the suspense account on a pro-rata basis as the loans are repaid. The trustee will allocate the shares released among participants on the basis of each participant’s proportional share of qualifying compensation relative to all participants participating in the ESOP Component. A participant will become 100 % vested in his or her account balance in the ESOP Component after three years of service. In addition, participants will become fully vested in his or her account balance in the ESOP Component automatically upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the KSOP. Generally, participants will receive distributions from the KSOP upon separation from service in accordance with the terms of the plan document. The KSOP reallocates any unvested shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock forfeited upon termination of employment among the remaining participants in the ESOP Component. Contributions to the ESOP are to be sufficient to pay principal and interest currently due under the loan agreement. Under applicable accounting requirements, Ponce Bank will record a compensation expense for the ESOP at the average market price of the shares as they are committed to be released from the unallocated suspense account to participants’ accounts, which may be more or less than the original issue price. The compensation expense resulting from the release of the common stock from the suspense account and allocation to plan participants will result in a corresponding reduction in the earnings of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. The ESOP shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations (see Note 11). As of June 30, 2023 , the combined outstanding balance of both the First ESOP loan and Second ESOP loan was $ 13.6 million. A summary of the ESOP shares as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows: June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Shares committed-to-be released 66,872 133,744 Shares allocated to participants 473,253 354,227 Unallocated shares 1,502,603 1,569,475 Total 2,042,728 2,057,446 Fair value of unallocated shares $ 13,058 $ 14,628 The Company recognized ESOP related compensation expense, including ESOP equalization expense, of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , and $ 0.6 million and $ 0.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 33 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan: The Bank maintains a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) for the benefit of two key executive officers. The SERP expense recognized for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $ 0.02 million each and for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $ 0.03 million each. 2018 Incentive Plan The Company’s stockholders approved the PDL Community Bancorp 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2018 Incentive Plan”) at the Special Meeting of Stockholders on October 30, 2018. The maximum number of shares of common stock which can be issued under the 2018 Incentive Plan is 1,248,469 . Of the 1,248,469 shares, the maximum number of shares that may be awarded under the 2018 Incentive Plan pursuant to the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) is 891,764 shares (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options), and the number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units is 356,705 shares. However, the 2018 Incentive Plan contains a flex feature that provides that awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units in excess of the 356,705 share limitation may be granted but each share of stock covered by such excess award shall reduce the 891,764 share limitation for awards of stock options and SARs by 3.0 shares of common stock. The Company converted 462,522 awards of stock options into 154,174 restricted stock units in 2018, 45,000 awards of stock options into 15,000 restricted stock units in 2020 and 191,145 awards of stock options into 63,715 restricted stock units in 2022. Under the 2018 Incentive Plan, the Company made grants equal to 674,645 shares on December 4, 2018 which include 119,176 incentive options to executive officers, 44,590 non-qualified options to outside directors, 322,254 restricted stock units to executive officers, 40,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers and 148,625 restricted stock units to outside directors. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company awarded 40,000 incentive options and 15,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers under the 2018 Incentive Plan. Awards to directors generally vest 20 % annually beginning with the first anniversary of the date of grant. Awards to a director with fewer than five years of service at the time of grant vest over a longer period and will not become fully vested until the director has completed ten years of service. Awards to the executive officer who is not a director vest 20 % annually beginning on December 4, 2020. On April 1, 2022, the Company awarded 23,718 incentive options to an executive officer, 30,659 incentive options to non-executive officers and 13,952 non-qualified options to an outside director. In addition, on April 1, 2022 the Company awarded 40,460 restricted stock units to executive officers and 23,255 restricted stock units to outside directors. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023 , the maximum number of stock options and SARs remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan for both periods was 4,883 , after the conversion from PDL Community Bancorp common stock to Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock or restricted stock units remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was none , for both periods. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determine the fair value of restricted stock units under the Company’s 2018 Incentive Plan. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. 34 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) A summary of the Company’s restricted stock unit awards activity and related information for six months ended June 30, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022 are as follows: June 30, 2023 Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested, beginning of year 245,840 $ 9.40 Granted — — Vested ( 4,147 ) 9.27 Forfeited — — Non-vested at March 31 241,693 $ 9.40 Granted — — Vested ( 21,235 ) 10.44 Forfeited ( 697 ) 9.15 Non-vested at June 30 219,761 $ 9.30 December 31, 2022 Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested, beginning of year 237,687 $ 12.65 Conversion and reorganization 93,933 — Granted 63,715 10.44 Vested ( 149,495 ) 9.11 Forfeited — — Non-vested at December 31 245,840 $ 9.40 Compensation expense related to restricted stock units was $ 0.4 million each for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 and was $ 0.7 million each for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

There were 218,433 shares and 190,508 shares exercisable as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. Total compensation cost related to stock options recognized was $ 0.05 million both for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , and $ 0.1 million both for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. As of June 30, 2023 , the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options was $ 0.4 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next 18 quarters.

The expected life is an estimate based on management’s review of the various factors and calculated using the simplified method for plain vanilla options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s history and expectation of dividend payouts. 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan The Company’s stockholders approved the 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) at the Special Meeting of Stockholders on June 15, 2023. The maximum number of shares of common stock which can be issued under the Plan is 1,920,368 . Of the 1,920,368 shares, the maximum number of shares that may be awarded under the Plan pursuant to the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) is 1,371,691 shares (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options), and the number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units is 548,677 shares.

Earnings Per Share The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: For the Three Months Ended June 30, For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (Dollars in thousands except share data) Net income (loss) $ ( 87 ) $ 771 $ 244 $ ( 6,049 ) Common shares outstanding for basic EPS: Weighted average common shares outstanding 24,743,843 24,724,274 24,802,654 23,739,658 Less: Weighted average unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) shares 1,535,675 1,667,715 1,552,297 1,495,882 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 23,208,168 23,056,559 23,250,357 22,243,776 Basic earnings (loss) per common share $ ( 0.00 ) $ 0.03 $ 0.01 $ ( 0.27 ) Potential dilutive common shares: Add: Dilutive effect of restricted stock awards and stock options — 72,352 24,844 — Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 23,208,168 23,128,911 23,275,201 22,243,776 Diluted earnings (loss) per common share $ ( 0.00 ) $ 0.03 $ 0.01 $ ( 0.27 ) Note 12. Commitments, Contingencies and Credit Risk Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk : In the normal course of business, financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk may be used to meet the financing needs of customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement in particular classes of financial instruments. The contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit represent the amounts of potential accounting loss should the contract be fully drawn upon, the customer default, and the value of any existing collateral become worthless. The same credit policies are used in making commitments and contractual obligations as for on-balance-sheet instruments. Financial instruments whose contractual amounts represent credit risk at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows: June 30, December 31, 2023 2022 (in thousands) Commitments to grant mortgage loans $ 386,995 $ 207,105 Commitments to sell loans at lock-in rates — 1,676 Unfunded commitments under lines of credit 63,459 72,530 $ 450,454 $ 281,311 Commitments to Grant Mortgage Loans : Commitments to grant mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as all terms and conditions are met as established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties. Material losses are not anticipated as a result of these transactions. 37 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Commitments to Sell Loans at Lock-in Rates: In order to assure itself of a marketplace to sell its loans, Mortgage World has agreements with investors who will commit to purchase loans at locked-in rates. Mortgage World has off-balance sheet market risk to the extent that Mortgage World does not obtain matching commitments from these investors to purchase the loans. This will expose Mortgage World to the lower of cost or market valuation environment. Repurchases, Indemnifications and Premium Recaptures : Loans sold by Mortgage World under investor programs are subject to repurchase or indemnification if they fail to meet the origination criteria of those programs. In addition, loans sold to investors are also subject to repurchase or indemnifications if the loan is two or three months delinquent during a set period which usually varies from six months to a year after the loan is sold. There are no open repurchase or indemnification requests for loans sold as a correspondent lender or where the Company acted as a broker in the transaction as of June 30, 2023. Unfunded Commitments Under Lines of Credit : Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extension of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit are uncollateralized and usually contain a specified maturity date and, ultimately, may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed. Unfunded Commitments with Bamboo : On October 1, 2022, the Bank entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Bamboo Payment Holding LLC (""Bamboo""). Under the agreement, the Bank purchased from Bamboo 180 Membership Interest Units representing an aggregate amount equal to up to 18 % of total issued and outstanding Membership Interest in Bamboo for a purchase price of $ 2.5 million. During the first six months of 2023, the Bank made two additional contributions for a total of $ 0.8 million for a total investment in Bamboo of $ 3.3 million and is committed to make two additional payments of $ 0.2 million each in August of 2023 and November of 2023. With over a decade processing payments in Latin America, Bamboo has a diverse network connects Latin American local payment processing to global companies as well as domestic solutions to locally based organizations. Unfunded Commitments with Oaktree : In December of 2021, the Bank committed to invest $ 5.0 million in Oaktree SBIC Fund, L.P. (""Oaktree""). As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total unfunded commitment was $ 2.4 million and $ 2.8 million, respectively. Unfunded Commitments with Silvergate : In April of 2022, the Bank committed to invest $ 5.0 million in EJF Silvergate Ventures Fund LP (""Silvergate""). As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total unfunded commitment was $ 2.7 million and $ 3.3 million, respectively. Letters of Credit : Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Letters of credit are largely cash secured. Concentration by Geographic Location : Loans, commitments to extend credit and letters of credit have been granted to customers who are located primarily in the New York City metropolitan area. Generally, such loans most often are secured by one-to-four family residential properties. The loans are expected to be repaid from the borrowers' cash flows. Legal Matters : The Company is involved in various legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal course of business. Management believes that resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Note 13. Fair Value The following fair value hierarchy is used based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2 – Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 38 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: Cash and Cash Equivalents, Placements with Banks, Accrued Interest Receivable, Advance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance, and Accrued Interest Payable : The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. These assets and liabilities are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Available-for-Sale Securities : These financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models (e.g., matrix pricing) or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Examples of such instruments include government agency bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Level 3 securities are securities for which significant unobservable inputs are utilized. There were no changes in valuation techniques used to measure similar assets during the period. FHLBNY Stock : The carrying value of FHLBNY stock approximates fair value since the Bank can redeem such stock with FHLBNY at cost. As a member of the FHLBNY, the Company is required to purchase this stock, which is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. Loans Receivable : For variable rate loans, which reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, carrying values are a reasonable estimate of fair values, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using estimated market rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. Impaired loans are valued using a present value discounted cash flow method, or the fair value of the collateral. Loans are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Loans Held for Sale : Loans held for sale, at fair value, consists of loans originated for sale by the Bank and accounted for under the fair value option. These assets are valued using stated investor pricing for substantially equivalent loans as Level 2. In determining fair value, such measurements are derived based on observable market data, including whole-loan transaction pricing and similar market transactions adjusted for portfolio composition, servicing value and market conditions. Loans held for sale by the Bank are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by investor bid prices. Under the fair value option, management has elected, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, fair value for substantially all forms of mortgage loans originated for sale on a recurring basis. The fair value carrying amount of mortgages held for sale measured under the fair value option was $ 10.1 million and the aggregate unpaid principal amounted to $ 10.1 million. Other Real Estate Owned : Other real estate owned represents real estate acquired through foreclosure, and is recorded at fair value less estimated disposal costs on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the asset is classified as Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the asset is classified as Level 3. Deposits : The fair values of demand deposits, savings, NOW and money market accounts equal their carrying amounts, which represent the amounts payable on demand at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-term, fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates on certificates of deposit to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on such deposits. Deposits are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. FHLBNY Advances : The fair value of the advances is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current market-based FHLBNY interest rates for advances of similar maturity to a schedule of maturities of such advances. These borrowings are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Warehouse Lines of Credit : The carrying amounts of warehouse lines of credit and mortgage loan funding payable approximate fair value and due to their short-term nature are classified as Level 2. One of the warehouse lines of credit was terminated on March 31, 2022 and one was terminated on February 7, 2023 Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments : Fair values for off-balance-sheet instruments (lending commitments and standby letters of credit) are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit standing. Off-balance-sheet instruments are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 39 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following tables detail the assets that are carried at fair value and measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and indicate the level within the fair value hierarchy utilized to determine the fair value: June 30, 2023 Description Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities, at fair value: U.S. Government Bonds $ 2,709 $ 2,709 $ — $ — Corporate bonds 23,023 719 22,304 — Mortgage-Backed Securities: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 35,404 — 35,404 — FHLMC Certificates 9,106 — 9,106 — FNMA Certificates 53,367 — 53,367 — GNMA Certificates 111 — 111 — Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at fair value 10,070 — 10,070 — $ 133,790 $ 3,428 $ 130,362 $ — December 31, 2022 Description Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities, at fair value: U.S. Government Bonds $ 2,689 $ 2,689 $ — $ — Corporate bonds 23,359 730 22,629 — Mortgage-Backed Securities: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 37,777 — 37,777 — FHLMC Certificates 9,634 — 9,634 — FNMA Certificates 55,928 — 55,928 — GNMA Certificates 118 — 118 — Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at fair value 1,979 — 1,979 — Derivatives from interest rate lock commitments 22 — — 22 $ 131,506 $ 3,419 $ 128,065 $ 22 Management’s assessment and classification of an investment within a level can change over time based upon maturity or liquidity of the investment and would be reflected at the beginning of the quarter in which the change occurred.

There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 assets or liabilities in the fair value hierarchy at June 30, 2023 and one security transferred out of Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2022. Fair value for Level 3 securities was determined using a third-party pricing service with limited levels of activity and price transparency. Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments : Loan commitments on which the committed interest rate is less than the current market rate are insignificant at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The fair value information about financial instruments are disclosed, whether or not recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. The estimated fair value amounts for 2023 and 2022 have been measured as of their respective period-ends and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these consolidated financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than amounts reported at each period. The information presented should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only required for a limited portion of the Company's assets and liabilities. Due to the wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company's disclosures and those of other banks may not be meaningful. Note 14. Regulatory Capital Requirements The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain 42 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s operations and financial statements. Under the regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total risk-based and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (as defined), common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined), and Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets (as defined) adjusted total assets (as defined). As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the applicable capital adequacy requirements specified below have been met. The below minimum capital requirements exclude the capital conservation buffer required to avoid limitations on capital distributions including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The applicable capital buffer for the Bank was 18.30 % at June 30, 2023 and 22.53 % at December 31, 2022. The most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Company and the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, common equity risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There were no conditions or events since then that have changed the Bank's category. The Company's and the Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 as compared to regulatory requirements are as follows: To Be Well Capitalized Under For Capital Prompt Corrective Actual Adequacy Purposes Action Provisions Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (Dollars in thousands) June 30, 2023 Ponce Financial Group, Inc.

Failure to maintain minimum capital requirements could result in the Bank’s Mortgage World division being unable to originate and service loans, and, therefore, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. (the “Company”). The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in Part I, Item 1, of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""intend,"" ""anticipate,"" ""assume,"" ""plan,"" ""seek,"" ""expect,"" ""will,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""indicate,"" ""would,"" ""believe,"" ""contemplate,"" ""continue,"" ""target"" and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: These forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company’s control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 45 Additional factors that may affect the Company’s results are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 under the heading “Risk Factors” filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 21, 2023. Because of these and other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. The Company is under no duty to and does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following discussion contains certain non-GAAP financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide the reader with additional supplemental perspective on operating results, performance trends, and financial condition. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial information. The Company’s non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP information which may be presented by other companies. In all cases, it should be understood that non-GAAP operating measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders. An item that management excludes when computing non-GAAP adjusted earnings can be of substantial importance to the Company’s results and condition for any particular year. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided below. The SEC has exempted from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on GAAP. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. However, the information should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The table below includes references to the Company's net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 before the Company’s contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation. In management's view, that information, which is considered non-GAAP information, may be useful to investors as it will improve an understanding of core operations for the current and future periods. The non-GAAP net income (loss) amount and earnings (loss) per share reflect adjustments related to the non-recurring gain on sale of real property and the Company’s contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation, net of tax effect. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP information to GAAP net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share is provided below. 46 Non-GAAP Reconciliation – Net Income (Loss) before the Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation (Unaudited) Six Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net income (loss) - GAAP $ 244 $ (6,049 ) Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation — 4,995 Income tax (benefit) provision — (1,049 ) Net income (loss) - non-GAAP $ 244 $ (2,103 ) Earnings (loss) per common share (GAAP) (1) $ 0.01 $ (0.27 ) Earnings (loss) per common share (non-GAAP) (1) $ 0.01 $ (0.09 ) The CARES Act On March 27, 2020, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) to address the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act appropriated $349.0 billion for PPP loans and on April 24, 2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) received another $310.0 billion in PPP funding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act appropriated $284.0 billion for both first and second draw PPP loans, bringing the total appropriations for PPP loans to $943.0 billion. PPP ended on May 31, 2021. Loans under the PPP that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The Company had received SBA approval and originated 5,340 PPP loans, of which 8 loans totaling $3.2 million were outstanding at June 30, 2023. PPP loans have a two-year or five-year term, provide for fees of up to 5% of the loan amount and earn interest at a rate of 1% per annum. It is our expectation that a significant portion of these remaining loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. Federal Economic Relief Funds To Aid Lending On June 7, 2022, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. (the “Company”), the holding company for Ponce Bank,‎ closed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 225,000 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A‎, par value $0.01 (the “Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price equal to $225,000,000 in cash, to the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) pursuant to the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”).‎ The holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a dividend payable in cash quarterly at an annual rate dependent on certain factors as reported by the Company to Treasury in a quarterly supplemental report. The initial dividend rate is zero percent for the first two years after issuance, and thereafter the floor dividend rate is 0.50% and the ceiling dividend rate is 2.00%. After 10 years of issuance, the perpetual dividend rate in effect, will be determined based on said floor and ceiling. The actual dividend rate that will be paid by the Company on the Preferred Stock cannot be determined at this time. The ECIP investment by the Treasury is part of a program to invest over $8.7 billion into Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) or ‎Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), of which Ponce Bank is both. The ECIP is intended to incentivize CDFIs and MDIs to provide loans, grants, ‎and forbearance to small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers in low-income and underserved communities that may have been ‎disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. 47 CDFI Equitable Recovery Program The Bank has been awarded a $3.7 million grant from the U.S. Treasury as part of the Community Development Financial Institutions (""CDFI"") Equitable Recovery Program (""ERP"") which aims to help CDFI's further their mission of helping low and low-to-moderate income communities recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bank expects that the grant will be disbursed during the third quarter of 2023 and its utilization would be subject to eligible activities and reporting in accordance with the ERP program. Critical Accounting Policies Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management and that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets, liabilities or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is established as probable incurred losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. Credit losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. See Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the accompanying Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. Factors Affecting the Comparability of Results Ponce De Leon Foundation. On January 27, 2022, the Company made a $5.0 million contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation as part of the conversion and reorganization, which is included in non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Write-off and Write-Down. In 2020, the Company entered into a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain. Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to $1,500 and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originates and services these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan is found to be fraudulent, becomes 90 days delinquent upon 90 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.” The Bank, pursuant to its agreement with Grain, at December 31, 2022, had 27,886 microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with credit extensions aggregating $18.2 million. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had 19,701 Grain microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $11.2 million and which were performing, in management’s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by an $9.8 million allowance for credit losses, resulting in $1.4 million in Grain microloans. Since the beginning of the Bank’s agreement with Grain and through June 30, 2023, 45,322 microloans amounting to $24.3 million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain. The Company has written-down a total of $15.7 million, net of recoveries, of the Grain Receivable and received $6.8 million in cash from Grain and through the application of security deposits connected to fraudulent loan accounts. The Bank also opted to use the $1.8 million grant it received from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Rapid Response ‎Program to defray the Grain Receivable. The application of those amounts resulted in no net receivable. Additionally, the Company wrote-off its equity investment in Grain of $1.0 million during the 48 year ended December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, the Company’s total exposure to Grain was $1.4 million of the remaining microloans, net of allowance for credit losses, excluding $2.4 million of unused commitments available to Grain borrowers and $1.3 million of security deposits by Grain borrowers. The $1.3 million of recoveries for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the $9.6 million write-off for the six months ended June 30, 2022 related to Grain is included in non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $1.3 million of recoveries for the six months ended June 30, 2023, $0.6 million were payments received from Grain on the Grain Receivable and the remainder were payments from Grain borrowers.

Excludes $1.3 million of security deposits by Grain originated borrowers reported in deposits in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Conditions. Grain has been victimized by cyber fraud using synthetic and other forms of fraudulent identifications, a phenomenon that has become prevalent with Fintechs. Grain remains a pre-profit startup highly dependent on earnings from its relationship with the Bank, a new relationship with another financial institution, and further capital raises which may not materialize. The Company continues to closely monitor its portfolio of consumer loans originated by Grain as well as Grain’s refinement of solutions for detecting and preventing cyber fraud in the application for microloans. The Company has requested, and Grain has agreed, that no new microloans be originated until further notice and that further extensions of credit to an existing microloan borrower only be made upon confirmation that such borrower is not fraudulent. Further, like other start-up companies, there is a higher level of risk that Grain may not be able to execute its business plan and may fail. In the event Grain were to cease operations, and although it has considered contingency plans, the Bank may have greater difficulty in servicing and collecting the microloan portfolio. In such a case, the level the Bank has provided for in its allowance for credit losses for its microloan portfolio may be inadequate and it may need to increase its provision for credit losses, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. As a consequence of such events, the Bank may determine it appropriate to terminate its relationship with Grain. Vision 2025 Evolves The Company has deployed a Fintech-based small business automated lending technology in partnership with LendingFront Technologies, Inc. The technology is a mobile application that digitizes the lending workflow from pre-approval to servicing and enables the Company to originate, close and fund small business loans within very short spans of time, without requiring a physical presence within banking offices and with automated underwriting using both traditional and non-traditional methods. The application has full loan origination and servicing capabilities and is integrated with Salesforce. All Commercial Relationship Officers and Business Development Managers will utilize these capabilities. The Company is seeking to establish loan origination partnerships with non-profit and community-based organizations to ensure penetration in underserved and underbanked markets. The Company also established a relationship with SaveBetter, LLC, a fintech startup focusing on brokered deposits. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had $377.1 million in such deposits. The recent regulatory easing of brokered deposit rules may enable the Company to classify such deposits as core deposits. 49 On October 1, 2022, the Bank entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Bamboo Payment Holding LLC (""Bamboo""). Under the agreement, the Bank purchased from Bamboo 180 Membership Interest Units representing an aggregate amount equal to up to 18% of total issued and outstanding Membership Interest in Bamboo for a purchase price of $2.5 million. During the first six months of 2023, the Bank made two additional contributions for a total of $0.8 million for a total investment in Bamboo of $3.3 million. With over a decade processing payments in Latin America, Bamboo has a diverse network connects Latin American local payment processing to global companies as well as domestic solutions to locally based organizations. At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $1.06 billion in assets, $918.5 million in loans and $809.8 million in deposits. The Company has since grown to $2.67 billion in assets, $1.70 billion in loans receivables, net of allowance for credit losses of $28.2 million, and $1.44 billion in deposits at June 30, 2023, all while investing in infrastructure, implementing digital banking, acquiring Mortgage World, adopting GPS, diversifying its product offering and partnering with Fintech companies. The Company raised over $132.0 million in additional capital through our conversion and reorganization and realized approximately $20.0 million in net gain while freeing up approximately $40.0 million in investable funds through our sale-and-leaseback initiative. Now, the Company believes that it is poised to enhance its presence, locally and in similar communities outside New York, as a leading CDFI and MDI financial institution holding company. On June 7, 2022, the Company issued 225,000 shares of the Company’s Preferred Stock‎, par value $0.01 for an aggregate purchase price equal to $225.0 million in cash to the Treasury, pursuant to the Treasury’s ECIP‎. Under the ECIP, Treasury provided investment capital directly to depository institutions that are CDFIs or MDIs or their holding companies, to provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers, in low-income and underserved communities. Treasury has indicated that the investment will qualify as Tier 1 capital. No dividends will accrue or be due for the first two years after issuance. For years three through ten, depending upon the level of qualified and/or deep impact lending made in targeted communities, as defined in the ECIP guidelines, dividends will be at an annual rate of either 2.0%, 1.25% or 0.5% and, thereafter, will be fixed at one of the foregoing rates. Holders of Preferred Stock generally do not have any voting rights, with the exception of voting rights on certain matters as outlined in the Certificate of Designations. The Company has the option to redeem the shares of Preferred Stock (i) in whole or in part on any dividend payment date on or after June 15, 2027, or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within ninety days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, as defined below, in each case at a cash redemption price equal to the liquidation amount, with an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not paid prior to the redemption date. The Company may not redeem shares of Preferred Stock without having received the prior approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency for the Company, as defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, to the extent required under applicable capital rules. Such redemptions are subject to certain conditions and limitations. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. A “Regulatory Capital Treatment Event” means a good-faith determination that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws, rules or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any agency or instrumentality of the United States, including the Federal Reserve and other appropriate federal bank regulatory agencies) that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any share of the Preferred Stock; (ii) any proposed change in those laws, rules or regulations that is announced after the initial issuance of any share of the Preferred Stock; or (iii) any official administrative or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws, rules or regulations or policies with respect thereto that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of the Preferred Stock, there is more than an insubstantial risk that we will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation preferences of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding as “Additional Tier 1 Capital” (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy standards of Federal Reserve Regulation Q, 12 C.F.R. Part 217 (or, as and if applicable, the successor capital adequacy guidelines, rules or regulations of the Federal Reserve or the capital adequacy guidelines, rules or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency), as then in effect and applicable, for as long as any share of Preferred Stock is outstanding. Comparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 Total Assets . Total consolidated assets increased $360.0 million, or 15.6%, to $2.67 billion at June 30, 2023 from $2.31 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in total assets is largely attributable to increases of $202.0 million in net loans receivable, $189.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $8.0 million in mortgage loans held for sale and $2.0 million in other assets, offset by decreases of $28.9 million in held-to-maturity securities, $5.8 million in available-for-sale securities, and $5.5 million in Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock. Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents increased $189.4 million, or 348.5%, to $243.8 million at June 30, 2023, compared to $54.4 million at December 31, 2022. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of increases of 50 $189.6 million in net deposits and $164.7 million in net borrowings and proceeds of $33.8 million from maturities/calls of securities, offset by an increase of $201.3 million in net loans. Securities.

The decrease was primarily due to a call on one of the securities in the amount of $10.0 million and changes in principal. 51 Gross Loans Receivable. The composition of gross loans receivable at June 30, 2023 and at December 31, 2022 and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows: June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Increase (Decrease) Amount Percent Amount Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential Investor-Owned $ 351,754 20.4 % $ 343,968 22.6 % $ 7,786 2.3 % Owner-Occupied 154,116 8.9 % 134,878 8.8 % 19,238 14.3 % Multifamily residential 550,033 31.9 % 494,667 32.4 % 55,366 11.2 % Nonresidential properties 317,416 18.4 % 308,043 20.2 % 9,373 3.0 % Construction and land 315,843 18.3 % 185,018 12.1 % 130,825 70.7 % Total mortgage loans 1,689,162 98.1 % 1,466,574 96.1 % 222,588 15.2 % Nonmortgage loans: Business loans (1) 21,041 1.2 % 39,965 2.6 % (18,924 ) (47.4 %) Consumer loans (2) 11,958 0.7 % 19,129 1.3 % (7,171 ) (37.5 %) 32,999 1.9 % 59,094 3.9 % (26,095 ) (44.2 %) Total $ 1,722,161 100.0 % $ 1,525,668 100.0 % $ 196,493 12.9 % Based on current internal loan reviews, the Company believes that the quality of our underwriting, our weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 58.7% and our customer selection processes have served us well and provided us with a reliable base with which to maintain a well-protected loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans, as defined by applicable banking regulations, include multifamily residential, nonresidential properties, and construction and land mortgage loans. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximately 5.4% and 6.4%, respectively, of the outstanding principal balance of the Bank’s commercial real estate mortgage loans were secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses predominantly on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on valuation of the real estate. Banking regulations have established guidelines relating to the amount of construction and land mortgage loans and investor- owned commercial real estate mortgage loans of 100% and 300% of total risk-based capital, respectively. Should a bank’s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. The Bank’s policy is to operate within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and up to 400% for investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank’s total risk-based capital. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Bank’s construction and land mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 65.7% and 38.5%, respectively. Investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 245.4% and 194.0% as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. At June 30, 2023, the Bank was within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and the 300% guideline for investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans established by banking regulators. Management believes that it has established the appropriate level of controls to monitor the Bank’s lending in these areas. Loans Held For Sale . Loans held for sale, at fair value, at June 30, 2023 increased $8.1 million, or 408.8%, to $10.1 million from $2.0 million at December 31, 2022. 52 Deposits. The composition of deposits at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and changes in dollars and percentages are summarized as follows: June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Increase (Decrease) Percent Percent Amount of Total Amount of Total Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Demand $ 266,545 18.4 % $ 289,149 23.1 % $ (22,604 ) (7.8 %) Interest-bearing deposits: NOW/IOLA accounts 22,754 1.6 % 24,349 1.9 % (1,595 ) (6.6 %) Money market accounts 538,520 37.3 % 317,815 25.4 % 220,705 69.4 % Reciprocal deposits 100,919 7.0 % 114,049 9.1 % (13,130 ) (11.5 %) Savings accounts 119,635 8.3 % 130,432 10.4 % (10,797 ) (8.3 %) Total NOW, money market, reciprocal and savings 781,828 54.2 % 586,645 46.8 % 195,183 33.3 % Certificates of deposit of $250K or more 83,646 5.8 % 70,113 5.6 % 13,533 19.3 % Brokered certificates of deposit (1) 98,729 6.9 % 98,754 7.9 % (25 ) (0.0 %) Listing service deposits (1) 20,258 1.4 % 35,813 2.9 % (15,555 ) (43.4 %) Certificates of deposit less than $250K 191,007 13.3 % 171,938 13.7 % 19,069 11.1 % Total certificates of deposit 393,640 27.4 % 376,618 30.1 % 17,022 4.5 % Total interest-bearing deposits 1,175,468 81.6 % 963,263 76.9 % 212,205 22.0 % Total deposits $ 1,442,013 100.0 % $ 1,252,412 100.0 % $ 189,601 15.1 % When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the Company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk and interest rate risk in line with management objectives. The Company’s Interest Rate Risk Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding and noncore funding reliance. The overall reliance on wholesale funding and noncore funding were within those policy limitations as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Management Asset/Liability Committee generally meets on a bi-weekly basis to review funding needs, if any, and to ensure the Company operates within the approved limitations. Borrowings . The Bank had outstanding borrowings at June 30, 2023 of $682.1 million in term advances from the FHLBNY and FRBNY and $511.4 million of outstanding term advances from the FHLBNY at December 31, 2022. The Bank also had $6.0 million of overnight line of credit advance from the FHLBNY at December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Bank had two unsecured lines of credit in the amount of $90.0 million with two correspondent banks, under which there was nothing outstanding at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Bank had no overnight line of credit advance at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Stockholders’ Equity . The Company’s consolidated stockholders’ equity decreased $2.2 million, or 0.45%, to $490.5 million at June 30, 2023 from $492.7 million at December 31, 2022. This decrease in stockholders’ equity was largely attributable to $5.2 million in share repurchases, partially offset by increases in equity of $1.1 million as a result of implementation of CECL, $0.8 million in share-based compensation, $0.6 million in ESOP, $0.3 million in other comprehensive loss related to improved valuation of securities and $0.2 million in net income. Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 The discussion of the Company’s results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 are presented below. The results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of future results. Overview. Net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was $0.1 million compared to net income of $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Loss per basic and diluted share was $0.00 for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.03 for three months ended June 30, 2022. The $0.9 million decrease of net income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 was due to a decrease $0.7 million of non-interest income, an increase of $0.5 million in non-interest expenses and a decrease of $0.3 million in benefit for income taxes, offset by an increase of $0.8 million in net interest income. 53 The following table presents the results of operations for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended June 30, Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Interest and dividend income $ 31,055 $ 17,167 $ 13,888 80.9 % Interest expense 14,773 1,679 13,094 779.9 % Net interest income 16,282 15,488 794 5.1 % Provision for loan losses 987 817 170 20.8 % Net interest income after provision for loan losses 15,295 14,671 624 4.3 % Non-interest income 1,492 2,179 (687 ) (31.5 %) Non-interest expense 17,089 16,567 522 3.2 % Loss income before income taxes (302 ) 283 (585 ) (206.7 %) Benefit for income taxes (215 ) (488 ) 273 (55.9 %) Net (loss) income $ (87 ) $ 771 $ (858 ) (111.3 %) Earnings per share: Basic $ (0.00 ) $ 0.03 $ (0.04 ) (111.3 %) Diluted $ (0.00 ) $ 0.03 $ (0.04 ) (111.3 %) Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $13.9 million, or 80.9%, to $31.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 from $17.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Interest income on loans receivable, which is the Company’s primary source of income, increased $7.0 million, or 43.3%, to $23.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 from $16.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks increased $6.9 million, or 624.3%, to $8.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 from $1.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The following table presents interest income on loans receivable for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended June 30, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) 1-4 Family residential $ 7,594 $ 4,970 $ 2,624 52.8 % Multifamily residential 6,726 4,134 2,592 62.7 % Nonresidential properties 3,783 2,863 920 32.1 % Construction and land 4,196 2,318 1,878 81.0 % Business loans 350 1,241 (891 ) (71.8 %) Consumer loans 366 531 (165 ) (31.1 %) Total interest income on loans receivable $ 23,015 $ 16,057 $ 6,958 43.3 % The following table presents interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended June 30, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Interest on deposits due from banks $ 1,817 $ 131 $ 1,686 1,287.0 % Interest on securities 5,731 909 4,822 530.5 % Dividend on FHLBNY stock 492 70 422 602.9 % Total interest and dividend income $ 8,040 $ 1,110 $ 6,930 624.3 % Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $13.1 million, or 779.9%, to $14.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 from $1.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase average cost of funds. The following table presents interest expense for the periods indicated: 54 For the Three Months Ended June 30, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Certificates of deposit $ 2,381 $ 678 $ 1,703 251.2 % Money market $ 5,874 $ 472 5,402 1,144.5 % Savings $ 29 $ 33 (4 ) (12.1 %) NOW/IOLA $ 8 $ 14 (6 ) (42.9 %) Advance payments by borrowers $ 2 $ 1 1 100.0 % Borrowings $ 6,479 $ 481 5,998 1,247.0 % Total interest expense $ 14,773 $ 1,679 $ 13,094 779.9 % Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $0.8 million, or 5.1%, to $16.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 from $15.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The $0.8 million increase in net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 was attributable to an increase of $13.9 million in interest and dividend income primarily due to increases in average loans receivable and interest and dividend on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks, offset by an increase of $13.1 million in interest expense due primarily to a higher average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest rate spread decreased by 201 basis point to 1.66% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 from 3.67% for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in the net interest rate spread for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 272 basis points to 3.40% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 from 0.68% for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and an increase in the average yields on interest-earning assets of 71 basis points to 5.06% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 from 4.35% for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Net interest margin decreased 127 basis points for the three months ended June 30, 2023, to 2.65% from 3.92% for three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting an increase in our securities portfolio and our organic loan growth. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%-5.50% during its July 26, 2023 meeting, pushing borrowing costs to the highest level in 22 years. The Federal Reserve has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income decreased $0.7 million, or 31.5%, to $1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 from $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in non-interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 was attributable to decreases of $0.7 million in loan origination fees, $0.2 million in brokerage commission and $0.1 million in income on sale of mortgage loans, partially offset by increases of $0.2 million in late and prepayment charges and $0.1 million in other non-interest income.

Non-interest expense increased $0.5 million, or 3.2%, to $17.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 from $16.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The $0.5 million increase in non-interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily attributable to increases of $0.5 million 55 in compensation and benefits, $0.5 million in occupancy and equipment, $0.5 million in provision for contingencies, $0.4 million in data processing expenses, $0.3 million in marketing and promotional expenses and $0.2 million in professional fees, partially offset by a $1.5 million charge in the prior year period and a $0.4 million recovery in the current year period related to Grain.

The results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of future results. Overview. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $0.2 million compared to net loss of $6.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Earnings per basic and diluted share was $0.01 for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to loss per basic and diluted share of ($0.27) for six months ended June 30, 2022. The $6.3 million increase of net income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was due to decreases of $11.2 million in non-interest expenses and $1.3 million in provision for loan losses, partially offset by an increase of a $3.8 million in provision for income taxes and decreases of $1.3 million in net interest income and $1.1 million of non-interest income. The following table presents the results of operations for the periods indicated: For the Six Months Ended June 30, Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Interest and dividend income $ 57,411 $ 36,185 $ 21,226 58.7 % Interest expense 25,884 3,359 22,525 670.6 % Net interest income 31,527 32,826 (1,299 ) (4.0 %) Provision for loan losses 813 2,075 (1,262 ) (60.8 %) Net interest income after provision for loan losses 30,714 30,751 (37 ) (0.1 %) Non-interest income 3,311 4,405 (1,094 ) (24.8 %) Non-interest expense 33,450 44,641 (11,191 ) (25.1 %) Income (loss) before income taxes 575 (9,485 ) 10,060 (106.1 %) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 331 (3,436 ) 3,767 (109.6 %) Net income (loss) $ 244 $ (6,049 ) $ 6,293 (104.0 %) Earnings (loss) per share: Basic $ 0.01 $ (0.27 ) $ 0.28 (103.9 %) Diluted $ 0.01 $ (0.27 ) $ 0.28 (103.9 %) 58 Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $21.2 million, or 58.7%, to $57.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 from $36.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Interest income on loans receivable, which is the Company’s primary source of income, increased $8.5 million, or 24.7%, to $42.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 from $34.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks increased $12.8 million, or 662.2%, to $14.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 from $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022.

Interest expense increased $22.5 million, or 670.6%, to $25.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 from $3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in the average cost of funds. For the Six Months Ended June 30, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Certificates of deposit $ 4,252 $ 1,480 $ 2,772 187.3 % Money market 9,999 708 9,291 1,312.3 % Savings 59 65 (6 ) (9.2 %) NOW/IOLA 17 30 (13 ) (43.3 %) Advance payments by borrowers 4 2 2 100.0 % Borrowings 11,553 1,074 10,479 975.7 % Total interest expense $ 25,884 $ 3,359 $ 22,525 670.6 % Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased $1.3 million, or 4.0%, to $31.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 from $32.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The $1.3 million decrease in net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022 was attributable to an increase of $22.5 million in interest expense due primarily to a higher average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities, offset by an increase of $21.2 million in interest and dividend income primarily due to increases in average loans receivable, interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks. Net interest rate spread decreased by 225 basis point to 1.71% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 from 3.96% for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in the net interest rate spread for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 253 basis points to 3.20% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 from 0.67% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and an increase in the average yields on interest-earning assets of 28 basis points to 4.91% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 from 4.63% for the six months ended June 30, 2022. 59 Net interest margin decreased 150 basis points for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to 2.70% from 4.20% for six months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting an increase in cost of funds. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%-5.50% during its July 26, 2023 meeting, pushing borrowing costs to the highest level in 22 years. The Federal Reserve has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income decreased $1.1 million, or 24.8%, to $3.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 from $4.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022 was attributable to decreases of $1.3 million in loan origination, $0.5 million in brokerage commission and $0.4 million in income on sale of mortgage loans, offset by increases of $0.9 million in late and prepayment charges, $0.2 million in other non-interest income and $0.1 million in service charges and fees.

The $11.2 million decrease in non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022 was attributable to a $9.6 million consumer microloan write-off during the corresponding period last year, compared with $1.3 million of consumer microloan recoveries during the six months ending June 30, 2023 and a $5.0 million contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation during the six months ended June 30, 2022.

The most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of the Bank’s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of its financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. The Bank’s Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in the Bank’s assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given the business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with policies and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank currently utilizes a third-party modeling solution that is prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate its sensitivity to changing interest rates, given the Bank’s business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank does not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities. Mortgage World did not engage in hedging activities to cover the risks of interest rate movements while it held mortgages for sale. The then low mortgage interest rates and their limited volatility had effectively mitigated such risks. Net Interest Income Simulation Models . Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software that measures the Bank’s earnings through simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, the Bank has policy guidelines for earnings risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest 62 rates. As of June 30, 2023, in the event of an instantaneous upward and downward change in rates from management's interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated: Net Interest Income Year 1 Change Rate Shift (1) Year 1 Forecast from Level (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 60,089 (13.02%) +300 62,169 (10.01%) +200 64,397 (6.78%) +100 66,715 (3.43%) Level 69,082 — % -100 72,010 4.24% Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The behavior of the deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in the projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the benefit in those scenarios. At June 30, 2023, the earnings simulation model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Economic Value of Equity Model . While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to net interest income, the Economic Value of Equity Model (“EVE”) measures estimated changes to the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. Rates are then shocked as prescribed by the Interest Rate Risk Policy to measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Interest Rate Risk Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At June 30, 2023, the EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: EVE as a Percentage of Present Value of Assets (3) Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Increase Change in Interest Estimated EVE EVE (Decrease) Rates (basis points) (1) EVE (2) Amount Percent Ratio (4) (basis points) (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 372,334 $ (110,797 ) (22.93 %) 15.58 % (2,293 ) +300 396,020 (87,111 ) (18.03 %) 16.23 % (1,803 ) +200 425,426 (57,705 ) (11.94 %) 17.04 % (1,194 ) +100 455,979 (27,152 ) (5.62 %) 17.85 % (562 ) Level 483,131 — — % 18.51 % — -100 509,730 26,599 5.51 % 19.10 % 551 Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 63 At June 30, 2023, the EVE model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors’ approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Most Likely Earnings Simulation Models . Management also analyzes a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress the balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management and weighted to determine the most likely result. These processes assist management to better anticipate financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to review other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. The Asset/Liability Committee reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing and capital policies. Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in the Bank’s regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behaviors that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from the Bank’s historical studies of financial instruments and the best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into Bank’s asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare its results to other banks. The Asset/Liability Management Committee may determine that the Company should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and its conclusions regarding interest rate fluctuations in future periods. The historically low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response the turmoil resulting from COVID-19 pandemic has ended. The Federal Reserve Board increased the benchmark federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.25% - 5.50% at its July 26, 2023 mee ting . The Federal Reserve Board has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. GAP Analysis . In addition, management analyzes interest rate sensitivity by monitoring the Bank’s interest rate sensitivity ""gap."" The interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing-liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period, and a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period. The following table sets forth the Company’s interest-earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities at June 30, 2023, which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown based upon certain assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at June 30, 2023, on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments. The loan amounts in 64 the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable-rate loans.

Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and EVE tables presented assume that the composition of the interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income and EVE tables provide an indication of the interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and EVE and will differ from actual results. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar 65 maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table. Interest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of loans, deposits and borrowings. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity describes the ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Company’s customers and to fund current and future planned expenditures. The primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and available-for-sale securities and proceeds from the sale of loans. The Bank also has access to borrow from the FHLBNY and the FRBNY. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Bank had $682.1 million and $517.4 million, respectively, of term and overnight outstanding advances from the FHLBNY and the FRBNY, and also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through letters of credit of up to $9.3 million as of June 30, 2023 and $21.5 million as of December 31, 2022. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there was eligible collateral of approximately $843.1 million and $478.8 million, respectively, in mortgage loans available to secure advances from the FHLBNY. The Bank also has two unsecured lines of credit of $90.0 million with two correspondent banks, of which there was none outstanding at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Bank did not have any outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements with brokers as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Although maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The most liquid assets are cash and interest-bearing deposits in banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $0.3 million and $26.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations, purchases of new securities, and purchase of equipment offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from maturities, calls and principal repayments on securities was ($160.0) million and ($286.6) million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting of activities in borrowing and deposit accounts, was $349.1 million and $381.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Bank’s management took steps to enhance the Company’s liquidity position by increasing its on balance sheet cash and cash equivalents position in order to meet unforeseen liquidity events and to fund upcoming funding needs. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, all regulatory capital requirements were met, resulting in the Company and the Bank being categorized as well capitalized at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change this categorization. Material Cash Requirements Commitments . As a financial services provider, the Company routinely is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. Although these contractual obligations represent the Company’s future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans originated. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans and extend credit of $450.5 million and $281.3 million, respectively. It is anticipated that the Company will have sufficient funds available to meet its current lending commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in 2023 totaled $134.6 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing time deposits will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits are not retained, the Company may utilize FHLBNY advances, unsecured credit lines with correspondent banks, or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. The Company adopted a share repurchase program effective May 16, 2023 which expires on May 15, 2024. Under the repurchase program, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to 1,235,000 shares of the Company's stock or approximately 5% of the Company's then current issued and outstanding shares. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company repurchased a total 66 of 615,948 shares of the Company's common stock. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 617,924 and 1,976 shares, respectively, were held as treasury stock as a result of share buy-back during 2023 and restricted stock units vested during 2022, respectively Contractual Obligations . In the ordinary course of its operations, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. There have been no material changes in the Company’s material cash requirements under its contractual obligations as discussed in its most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Other Material Cash Requirements. In addition to contractual obligations, the Company’s material cash requirements also includes compensation and benefits expenses for its employees, which were $14.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The Company also has material cash requirements for occupancy and equipment expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization of $0.9 million, related to rental expenses, general maintenance and cleaning supplies, guard services, software licenses and other miscellaneous expenses, which were $6.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part I, Item 2 of this report under “Management of Market Risk”. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of June 30, 2023. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, there were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting. 67 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. The Company is not involved in any pending legal proceedings as a plaintiff or a defendant other than routine legal proceeding occurring in the ordinary course of business.

1. Nature of Business and Summa ry of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Consolidation: Ponce Financial Group, Inc. (hereafter referred to as “we,” “our,” “us,” “Ponce Financial Group, Inc.,” or the “Company”) is the holding company of Ponce Bank (“Ponce Bank” or the “Bank”), a federally chartered stock savings association. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary Ponce Bank (the “Bank”) and the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Ponce De Leon Mortgage Corp., which is a mortgage banking entity. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Nature of Operations: The Company is a savings and loan holding company. The Company is subject to the regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Company’s business is conducted through the administrative office and 13 full service banking and 6 mortgage loan offices. The banking offices are located in New York City – the Bronx ( 4 branches), Queens ( 3 branches), Brooklyn ( 3 branches), Manhattan ( 2 branches) and Union City ( 1 branch), New Jersey. The mortgage loan offices are located in Queens ( 4 ) and Brooklyn ( 1 ), New York and Bergenfield ( 1 ), New Jersey. The Company’s primary market area currently consists of the New York City metropolitan area. The Bank is a federally chartered stock savings association headquartered in the Bronx, New York. It was originally chartered in 1960 as a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association under the name Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1985, the Bank changed its name to “Ponce De Leon Federal Savings Bank.” In 1997, the Bank changed its name again to “Ponce De Leon Federal Bank.” Upon the completion of its reorganization into a mutual holding company structure in September of 2017, the assets and liabilities of Ponce De Leon Federal Bank were transferred to and assumed by the Bank. The Bank is a Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), a Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”), and a certified Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lender. The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). The Bank’s business primarily consists of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in mortgage loans, consisting of one-to-four family residential (both investor-owned and owner-occupied), multifamily residential, nonresidential properties and construction and land, and, to a lesser extent, in business and consumer loans. The Bank also invests in securities, which have historically consisted of U.S. government and federal agency securities and securities issued by government-sponsored or owned enterprises, mortgage-backed securities and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the “FHLBNY”) stock. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts, including demand, savings, money markets and certificates of deposit accounts. Risks and Uncertainties: With the continuation of the sustained conflict and disruption in the Ukraine, the impact to Ukraine as well as actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions imposed by Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U.S. and other countries and companies and organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Russia, and actions taken by Russia in response to such sanctions, and each country’s potential response to such sanctions, tensions, and military actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Inflation and interest rates may continue to adversely impact several industries within our geographic footprint and impair the ability of the Company’s customers to fulfill their contractual obligations to the Company. This could cause the Company to experience adverse effects on its business operations, loan portfolio, financial condition, and results of operations. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the benefit for credit losses amounted to $ 0.2 million primarily due to a net benefit of $ 0.3 million related to loans originated by Grain Technology, Inc. (""Grain"") (see Note 4 for additional information related to Grain reserves) countered by increases in the loan portfolio and a provisions of $ 0.1 million related to held-to-maturity securities. 6 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Use of Estimates : In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, the valuation of loans held for sale, the valuation of deferred tax assets and investment securities and the estimates relating to the valuation for share-based awards. Interim Financial Statements : The interim consolidated financial statements at March 31, 2023, and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 are unaudited and reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 , are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2023, or any other period. Significant Group Concentrations of Credit Risk : Most of the Bank's activities are with customers located within New York City. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the Bank's loan portfolio and the ability of Mortgage World, a division of the Bank, to sell originated loans in the secondary markets are susceptible to changes in the local market conditions. Note 3 discusses the types of securities in which the Bank invests. Notes 4 and 12 discuss the types of lending that the Bank engages in, and other concentrations. Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts due from banks (including items in process of clearing). For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash flows from loans originated by the Company, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions, and deposits are reported net. Included in cash and cash equivalents are restricted cash from escrows and good faith deposits. Escrows consist of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) upfront mortgage insurance premiums and escrows on unsold mortgages that are held on behalf of borrowers. Good faith deposits consist of deposits received from commercial loan customers for use in various disbursements relating to the closing of a commercial loan. Securities : Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the date individual investment securities are acquired, and the appropriateness of such classification is reassessed at each statement of financial condition date. Debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as ""held-to-maturity"" and recorded at amortized cost. Trading securities, if any, are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings. Securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading, are classified as ""available-for-sale"" and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. Held-to maturity securities : Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Topic 326, ""Financial Instruments - Credit Losses"" which replaced the previously existing U.S. GAAP ""incurred loss"" approach to ""expected credit losses"" approach, which is referred as Current Expected Credit Losses (""CECL""). CECL modifies the accounting of impairment on held-for-sale debt securities by recognizing a credit loss through an allowance for credit losses. The Company methodology to measure the allowance for credit loss (""ACL"") incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information to assess lifetime expected credit losses at the portfolio level. The quantitative component includes the calculation of loss rates using an open pool method. The Company differentiates its loss-rate method for a pool of held-to-maturity corporate securities by looking to publicly available historical default and recovery statistics based on the attributes of issuer type, rating category and time to maturity. The Company measures expected credit losses of these financial assets by applying loss rates to the amortized cost basis of each asset taking into consideration amortization, prepayment and default assumptions. The Company considers qualitative adjustments to expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. Qualitative factor adjustments may increase or decrease management's estimate of expected credit losses. Adjustments will not be made for information that has already been considered and included in the quantitative allowance. Available-for-sale securities : The impairment model for available-for-sale (""AFS"") debt securities differs from the CECL approach utilized by held-to-maturity (""HTM"") debt securities since AFS debt securities are measured at fair value rather than amortized cost. For AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Bank first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. 7 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the available-for-sale securities for impairment. Securities that are in an unrealized loss position are reviewed to determine if a securities credit loss exists based on certain quantitative and qualitative factors. The primary factors considered in evaluating whether an impairment exists include: (a) the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, (b) the financial condition, credit rating and future prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, and (d) whether the Company intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not the Company will not be required to sell the security. If a determination is made that a security is impaired, the Company will estimate the amount of the unrealized loss that is attributable to credit and all other non-credit related factors. The credit related component will be recognized as a securities credit loss as a provision expense through the establishment of an allowance for available for sale securities. The securities credit loss expense will be limited to the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and fair value and any future changes may be reversed, limited to the amount previously expensed in the period they occur. The non-credit related component will be recorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The evaluation of securities for impairment is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the estimated fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include change in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition and/or future prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads, and the expected recovery period. See Note 3 (""Securities"") of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock : The Bank is a member of the FHLBNY. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. FHLBNY stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. Loans Receivable : Loans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at current unpaid principal balances, net of the allowance for credit losses on loans and including net deferred loan origination fees and costs. Interest income is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the interest method without anticipating prepayments. A loan is moved to nonaccrual status in accordance with the Company’s policy typically after 90 days of non-payment. The accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is generally discontinued at the time the loan becomes 90 days past due unless the loan is well-secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than 90 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All nonaccrual loans are considered impaired loans. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual are reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash basis or recorded against principal balances, until qualifying for return to accrual. Cash basis interest recognition is only applied on nonaccrual loans with a sufficient collateral margin to ensure no doubt with respect to the collectability of principal. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and remain current for a period of time (typically six months) and future payments are reasonably assured. Accrued interest receivable is closely monitored for collectability and will be charged-off in a timely manner if deemed uncollectable. In the event that collection of principal becomes uncertain, the Company has policies in place to write-off accrued interest receivable by reversing interest income in a timely manner. Therefore, the Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis and therefore excludes it from the measurement of the ACL. Allowance for Credit Losses : The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on loans is management's estimate of expected credit losses over the expected life of the loans at the reporting date. The ACL on loans is increased through a provision for credit losses (“PCL”) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and by recoveries of amounts previously charged off. The ACL on loans is reduced by charge-offs on loans. Loan charge-offs are recognized when Management believes the collectability of the principal balance outstanding is unlikely. Full or partial charge-offs on collateral-dependent individually analyzed loans are generally recognized when the collateral is deemed to be insufficient to support the carrying value of the loan. According to ASC 326-20-30-9, estimating expected credit losses is highly judgmental and generally will require Ponce Bank to make specific judgments. One of these specific judgments around how Ponce Bank will make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts of expected credit losses. Ponce Bank uses Federal Open Market Committee to obtain various forecasts for unemployment rate, national gross domestic product and the National Consumer Price Index. Ponce Bank has elected to forecast the first four quarters of the credit loss estimate and revert to a long-run average of each considered economic factor as permitted in ASC 326-20-30-9. 8 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The level of the ACL on loans is based on Management's ongoing review of all relevant information, from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions and reasonable forecast. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for calculation of probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default and the estimation of expected credit losses. As discussed further below, adjustments to historical information are made for differences in specific risk characteristics, such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term, as well as for changes in environmental conditions, that may not be reflected in historical loss rates. Management employs a process and methodology to estimate the ACL on loans that evaluates both quantitative and qualitative factors. Under ASC 326-20-30-2 and 326-20-55-5, Ponce Bank should aggregate financial assets on the basis of similar risk characteristics. Management selected a Call Code segmentation, as based on the Bank's call report. Management’s criteria for determining an appropriate segmentation (1) groups loans based on similar risk characteristics; (2) allows for mapping and utilization/application of publicly available external information (Call Report Filings); (3) allows for mapping and utilization/application of publicly available external information; (4) federal call code is granular enough to accommodate enough to accommodate a “like-kind” notion, yet broad enough to maintain statistical relevance and/or a meaningful number of loan observations within material segments and (5) federal call code designation is identifiable throughout historical data sets, which is critical component of segmentation selection. Quantitative loss factors are also supplemented by certain qualitative risk factors reflecting Management's view of how losses may vary from those represented by quantitative loss rates. These qualitative risk factors include: (1) changes in lending policies, procedures and strategies including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses; (2) economic conditions such as the Bank’s market area, customer demographics, portfolio composition, along with national indicators considered impactful to the model; (3) changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio; (4) credit and lending staff/administration; (5) problem with loan trends; (6) concentrations; (7) loan review results; (8) collateral values and regulatory and business environment. Because the methodology is based upon historical experience and trends, current economic data, reasonable and supportable forecasts, as well as Management's judgment, factors may arise that result in different estimations. Deteriorating conditions or assumptions could lead to further increases in the ACL on loans. The ACL on loans is determined by an estimate of future credit losses, and ultimate losses may vary from Management's estimate.. Allowances for Credit Losses on Unfunded Commitments : The ACL on unfunded commitments is Management's estimate of expected credit losses over the expected credit losses over the expected contractual term (or life) in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditional cancellable by the Company. For each portfolio, estimated loss rates and funding factors are applied to the corresponding balance of unfunded commitments and the estimated loss rates applied to unfunded commitments are the same quantitative and qualitative loss rates applied to the corresponding on-balance sheet amounts in determining the ACL on loans. The estimated funding factor applied to unfunded commitments represents the likelihood that the funding will occur and is based upon the Company's average historical utilization rate each portfolio. The ACL on unfunded commitments in included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Conditions. The ACL on unfunded commitments is adjusted through non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value : Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, include residential mortgages that were originated in accordance with secondary market pricing and underwriting standards. These loans are loans originated by the Bank’s Mortgage World division and the Company intends to sell these loans on the secondary market. Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. The gains or losses for the changes in fair value of these loans are included in income on sale of mortgage loans on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale measured under the fair value option is calculated based on the principal amount of the loan and is included in interest loans receivable on the consolidated statements of operations. Derivative Financial Instruments : The Company, through the Bank’s Mortgage World division, uses derivative financial instruments as a part of its price risk management activities. All such derivative financial instruments are designated as free-standing derivative instruments. In accordance with FASB ASC 815-25, Derivatives and Hedging , all derivative instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their fair value. Change in the fair value of these derivatives is reported in current period earnings. Additionally, to facilitate the sale of mortgage loans, the Bank, through its Mortgage World division, may enter into forward sale positions on securities, and mandatory delivery positions. Exposure to losses or gains on these positions is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid. As of March 31, 2023 , the Company did not enter into any forward sale or mandatory delivery positions on their financial instruments. 9 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The Company’s revenue from contracts with customers in the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contract with Customers , is recognized within noninterest income. ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Management determined the revenue streams impacted by ASC 606 included those related to service charges on deposit accounts, ATM and card fees and other services fees. The Company’s revenue recognition pattern for these revenue streams did not change from current practice. The Company's primary sources of revenue are interest income on financial assets and income from mortgage banking activities, which are explicitly excluded from the scope of ASC 606. Transfers of Financial Assets : Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when all of the components meet the definition of a participating interest and when control over the assets has been surrendered. A participating interest generally represents (1) a proportionate (pro rata) ownership interest in an entire financial asset, (2) a relationship where from the date of transfer all cash flows received from the entire financial asset are divided proportionately among the participating interest holders in an amount equal to their share of ownership, (3) the priority of cash flows has certain characteristics, including no reduction in priority, subordination of interest, or recourse to the transferor other than standard representation or warranties, and (4) no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Bank, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Bank does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either (a) an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity or (b) the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a clean-up call. Premises and Equipment : Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed and charged to operations using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows: Years Buildings 39 Building improvements 15 - 39 Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 3 - 10 Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated economic lives or the related lease terms, including extensions expected to be exercised. Gains and losses on dispositions are recognized upon realization. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and improvements are capitalized. Leasehold improvements in process are not amortized until the assets are placed in operation. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets : Long-lived assets, including premises and leasehold improvements, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated by that review, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to noninterest expense. Leases : The Company leases office space and certain equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements and determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company does not currently have any financing lease arrangements. Right of use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right of use assets are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term adjusted for initial direct costs, if any, and lease incentives received or deemed probable of being received. The Company uses the rate implicit in the lease if it is readily determinable or otherwise the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The implicit rates of Company leases are not readily determinable and accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date for all leases. The Company's incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms and in a similar economic environment. The Company uses its FHLBNY borrowing rate based on the information available on the commencement date plus a spread of 2.50 % in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in “Occupancy and equipment” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Some of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation which are accounted for as variable lease amounts but are not reflected as a component of the Company’s lease liability. Certain leases also require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises or equipment which are also not reflected as a component of the Company’s lease liability 10 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Other Real Estate Owned : Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) represents properties acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure or other proceedings. OREO is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated disposal costs, at the date of foreclosure, which establishes a new cost basis. After foreclosure, the properties are held for sale and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs of disposal. Any write-down to fair value, at the time of transfer to OREO, is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Properties are evaluated regularly to ensure that the recorded amounts are supported by current fair values and charges against earnings are recorded as necessary to reduce the carrying amount to fair value, less estimated costs to dispose. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property are capitalized, subject to the limit of fair value of the OREO, while costs relating to holding the property are expensed. Gains or losses are included in operations upon disposal. Income Taxes : The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income, in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 % likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, would be classified as additional provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. Related Party Transactions : Directors and officers of the Company and their affiliates have been customers of and have had transactions with the Company, and it is expected that such persons will continue to have such transactions in the future. Management believes that all deposit accounts, loans, services and commitments comprising such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other customers who are not directors or officers. In the opinion of management, the transactions with related parties did not involve more than normal risk of collectability, nor favored treatment or terms, nor present other unfavorable features. Note 16 contains details regarding related party transactions. Employee Benefit Plans: The Company maintains a KSOP, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) provisions incorporated, a Long-Term Incentive Plan that includes grants of restricted stock units and stock options, and a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”). KSOP, the Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions: Compensation expense is recorded as shares are committed to be released with a corresponding credit to unearned KSOP equity account at the average fair market value of the shares during the period and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the service period based upon management’s estimate of the number of shares expected to be allocated by the KSOP. The difference between the average fair market value and the cost of the shares allocated by the KSOP is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in-capital. Unallocated common shares held by the Company’s KSOP are shown as a reduction in stockholders’ equity and are excluded from weighted-average common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted earnings per share calculations until they are committed to be released. The 401(k) provisions provide for elective employee/participant deferrals of income. Discretionary matching, profit-sharing, and safe harbor contributions, not to exceed 4 % of employee compensation and profit-sharing contributions may be provided. Stock Options: The Company recognizes the value of shared-based payment transactions as compensation costs in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. The fair value of the share-based payments for 11 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur during the period. Restricted Stock Units: The Company recognizes compensation cost related to restricted stock units based on the market price of the stock units at the grant date over the vesting period. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determines the fair value of restricted stock units. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Comprehensive Income (Loss): Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss), which are both recognized as separate components of stockholder’s equity. Other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale. Loss Contingencies : Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are any such matters that will have a material effect on the operations and financial position of the Company. Fair Value of Financial Instruments : Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in Note 13. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates. Segment Reporting : Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the “CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment and one reportable segment. Loan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments : Financial instruments include off‑balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. Earnings (Loss) per Share (“EPS”) : Basic EPS represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding, plus the effect of potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Basic weighted common shares outstanding is weighted average common shares outstanding less weighted average unallocated ESOP shares. Treasury Stock : Shares repurchased under the Company’s share repurchase programs were purchased in open-market transactions and are held as treasury stock. The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of stockholders’ equity. Reclassification of Prior Periods Presentation : Certain prior periods amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reporting results of operations and did not affect previously reported amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations 12 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Updates (""ASU""): In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” This ASU requires all lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset, measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, at the lease commencement date. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged under the new guidance. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, for public business entities. The Company took advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards as an EGC, and it adopted the amendments in this update for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022.. The Company has evaluated the amended guidance including the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Company has identified its leased office spaces and equipment as within the scope of the guidance. The Company currently leases its administrative office and 15 branches and mortgage offices and the new guidance resulted in the establishment of a right to use asset of $ 36.2 million and corresponding lease obligations of $ 36.7 million as of January 1, 2022. The Company has adopted this standard on December 31, 2022, effective January 1, 2022 . In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “ Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This ASU significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The standard is to replace today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model. The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model, is to apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments and financial guarantees. The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities. For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. As a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time, as they do today. The ASU also reportedly simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt, securities and loans. ASU 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity’s assumptions, models and methods for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, entities will need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, for public business entities, that are not deemed to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC as of November 15, 2019. The Company has adopted the amendments in this update on January 1, 2023. Entities have to apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings (i.e., modified retrospective approach). As a result of the required change in approach toward determining estimated credit losses from the current “incurred loss” model to one based on estimated cash flows over a loan’s contractual life, adjusted for prepayments (a “life of loan” model), the Company recognized, net of taxes, a reduction of $ 2.4 million in the allowance credit for losses on loans, countered by increases of $ 0.8 million in unfunded commitments and $ 0.5 million in the allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, "" Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) . ” This ASU eliminates troubled debt restructuring guidance for organizations that adopted the amendments in ASU 2016-13 while providing for additional disclosures for loan modifications. This new guidance introduces new disclosure requirements for modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Creditors should evaluate all modifications as either a new loan or continuation of an existing loan under the general guidance on loan refinancing and restructuring in ASC 310-20-35-9 through 35-11. The Company has adopted the amendments in this update on January 1, 2023. The Company has evaluated the impact of this guidance and it has no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 13 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted: In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) . ” This ASU provides optional means and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or other reference rates expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU were initially effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, ""Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date (Topic 848) . "" This ASU extends the sunset (or expiration) date of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 848 to December 31, 2024. This gives reporting entities two additional years to apply the accounting relief provided under ASC Topic 848 for matters related to reference rate reform. ASU 2022-06 is effective for all reporting entities immediately upon issuance and must be applied on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Note 2. Preferred Stock Issuance; Plan of Conversion and Stock Offering Preferred Stock Issuance On June 7, 2022, the Company‎ closed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 225,000 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A‎, par value $ 0.01 (the “Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price equal to $ 225.0 million in cash, to the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) pursuant to the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”).‎ The holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a dividend payable in cash quarterly at an annual rate dependent on certain factors as reported by the Company to Treasury in a quarterly supplemental report. The initial dividend rate is zero percent for the first two years after issuance, and thereafter the floor dividend rate is 0.50 % and the ceiling dividend rate is 2.00 %. After 10 years of issuance, the perpetual dividend rate in effect, will be determined based on said floor and ceiling. The actual dividend rate that will be paid by the Company on the Preferred Stock cannot be determined at this time. The ECIP investment by the Treasury is part of a program to invest over $ 8.7 billion into Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) or ‎Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), of which Ponce Bank is both. The ECIP is intended to incentivize CDFIs and MDIs to provide loans, grants, ‎and forbearance to small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers in low-income and underserved communities that may have been ‎disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.‎ In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $ 1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. Plan of Conversion and Common Stock Offering On May 25, 2021, Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company and PDL Community Bancorp, the then holding company for Ponce Bank and Mortgage World Bankers, Inc., announced that their Boards of Directors had unanimously adopted a Plan of Conversion and Reorganization (the “Plan”) pursuant to which Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company and PDL Community Bancorp reorganized into a new stock holding company and conducted a second-step stock offering of new shares of common stock. On January 26, 2022, Mortgage World transferred its assets and liabilities to Ponce Bank and ceased operating as an independent mortgage banking entity. Mortgage World’s business is now conducted as a division of Ponce Bank. On January 27, 2022, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and PDL Community Bancorp announced that the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from the mutual to stock form of organization and related stock offering was consummated at the close of business. As a result of the closing of the conversion and reorganization and stock offering, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. is now the holding company for Ponce Bank. Ponce Bank’s former mutual holding companies, PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, have ceased to exist. PDL Community Bancorp’s stock ceased trading at the close of the market on January 27, 2022. Ponce Financial Group, Inc.’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the same trading symbol “PDLB” on January 28, 2022. As a result of the conversion and reorganization, each issued and outstanding share of PDL Community Bancorp common stock was converted into the right to receive 1.3952 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. Cash was paid in lieu of any fractional shares based on the sale price in the offering of $ 10.00 per share. Ponce Financial Group Inc.’s total issued and outstanding shares on January 28, 2022 was 24,711,834 shares. All shares of treasury stock of PDL Community Bancorp were eliminated on January 27, 2022. 14 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) On January 27, 2022, the Company made a $ 5.0 million in contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation as part of the conversion and reorganization, which is included in the non-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Note 3. Securities Adoption of Topic 326 Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the provisions of Topic 326 using the modified retrospective method.

Management reviewed the financial condition of the entities underlying the securities at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The unrealized losses related to the Company debt securities were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies. The Company does not believe that the debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2023 represents a credit loss impairment. The gross unrealized loss positions related to mortgage-backed securities and other obligations issued by the U.S government agencies or U.S. 17 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) government-sponsored enterprises carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. Total gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities. Management reviewed the collectability of the corporate bonds taking into consideration of such factors as the financial condition of the issuers, reported regulatory capital ratios of the issuers, credit ratings, including ratings in effect as of the reporting date. Management believes the unrealized losses on the corporate bonds are primarily attributable to changes in the interest rates and not changes in the credit quality of the issuers of the corporate bonds. The following is a summary of maturities of securities at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Amounts are shown by contractual maturity.

The Company primarily grants loans secured by real estate to individuals and businesses pursuant to an established credit policy applicable to each type of lending activity in which it engages. Although collateral provides assurance as a secondary source of repayment, the Company ordinarily requires the primary source of repayment to be based on the borrowers’ ability to generate continuing cash flows. The Company also evaluates the collateral and creditworthiness of each customer. The credit policy provides that depending on the borrowers’ creditworthiness and type of collateral, credit may be extended up to predetermined percentages of the market value of the collateral or on an unsecured basis. Real estate is the primary form of collateral. Other important forms of collateral are time deposits and marketable securities. For disclosures related to the allowance for credit losses and credit quality, the Company does not have any disaggregated classes of loans below the segment level. Credit-Quality Indicators : Internally assigned risk ratings are used as credit-quality indicators, which are reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. The objectives of the Company’s risk-rating system are to provide the Board of Directors and senior management with an objective assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio, to promptly and accurately identify loans with well-defined credit weaknesses so that timely action can be taken to minimize credit loss, to identify relevant trends affecting the collectability of the loan portfolio, to isolate potential problem areas and to provide essential information for determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Below are the definitions of the internally assigned risk ratings: 20 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Loans within the top four categories above are considered pass rated, as commonly defined. Risk ratings are assigned as necessary to differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised to reflect changes in the borrowers’ financial condition and outlook, debt service coverage capability, repayment performance, collateral value and coverage as well as other considerations.

1,525,668 Loans are considered impaired when current information and events indicate all amounts due may not be collectable according to the contractual terms of the related loan agreements. Impaired loans, including troubled debt restructurings, are identified by applying normal loan review procedures in accordance with the allowance for credit losses methodology. Management periodically assesses loans to determine whether impairment exists. Any loan that is, or will potentially be, no longer performing in accordance with the terms of the original loan contract is evaluated to determine impairment. 23 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following information relates to impaired loans as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022: Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized As of and For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on a Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential $ 11,212 $ 9,452 $ 1,358 $ 10,810 $ 160 $ 10,197 $ 83 Multifamily residential 1,437 1,439 — 1,439 — 720 — Nonresidential properties 833 452 340 792 37 796 7 Construction and land 11,905 11,905 — 11,905 — 9,736 — Nonmortgage loans: Business 40 — 40 40 40 20 — Consumer — — — — — — Total $ 25,427 $ 23,248 $ 1,738 $ 24,986 $ 237 $ 21,469 $ 90 Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized As of and For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on a Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential $ 11,131 $ 8,386 $ 2,412 $ 10,798 $ 207 $ 11,970 $ 76 Multifamily residential — — — — — 1,104 — Nonresidential properties 2,023 1,636 355 1,991 38 3,399 20 Construction and land 7,567 7,567 — 7,567 — 1,568 17 Nonmortgage loans: Business — — — — — 12 — Consumer — — — — — 24 — Total $ 20,721 $ 17,589 $ 2,767 $ 20,356 $ 245 $ 18,077 $ 113 Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized As of and for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on a Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential $ 9,986 $ 7,827 $ 1,757 $ 9,584 $ 159 $ 11,072 $ 307 Multifamily residential — — — — — 630 — Nonresidential properties 843 457 344 801 37 1,930 30 Construction and land 7,567 7,567 — 7,567 — 6,408 — Nonmortgage loans: Business — — — — — 3 — Consumer — — — — — — — Total $ 18,396 $ 15,851 $ 2,101 $ 17,952 $ 196 $ 20,043 $ 337 Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, the Company classified certain loans as troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) loans when credit terms to a borrower in financial difficulty were modified, in accordance with ASC 310-40. With the adoption of ASU 2022-02 as of January 1, 2023, the Company has ceased to recognize or measure for new TDRs but those existing at December 31, 2022 will remain until settled. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 , and for the year ended December 31, 2022, there were no loans restructured as a troubled debt restructuring. 24 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) At March 31, 2023 , there were 23 troubled debt restructured loans totaling $ 6.5 million of which $ 4.2 million are on accrual status. At December 31, 2022, there were 23 troubled debt restructured loans totaling $ 6.6 million of which $ 4.2 million are on accrual status. There were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. The financial impact from the concessions made represents specific impairment reserves on these loans, which aggregated to $ 0.2 million both at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale at Fair Value At March 31, 2023 and at December 31, 2022 , 5 loans and 4 loans related to Mortgage World in the amount of $ 3.0 million and $ 2.0 million, respectively, were held for sale and accounted for under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. Write-off and write-down of Microloans In 2020, the Company entered into a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain. Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to $ 1,500 and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originates and services these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan is found to be fraudulent, becomes 90 days delinquent upon 90 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.” At December 31, 2022, the Bank had 27,886 Grain microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $ 18.2 million and which were performing, in management's opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by a $ 15.4 million allowance for loan losses, resulting in $ 2.8 million in Grain microloans, net of allowance for loan losses. At March 31, 2023, the Bank had 22,859 Grain microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $ 13.4 million and which were performing, in management’s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by an $ 11.6 million allowance for credit losses, resulting in $ 1.8 million in Grain microloans. Since the beginning of the Bank’s agreement with Grain and through March 31, 2023, 45,322 microloans amounting to $ 25.1 million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain. The Company has written-down a total of $ 16.5 million, net of recoveries, of the Grain Receivable and received $ 6.7 million in cash from Grain and through the application of security deposits connected to fraudulent loan accounts. The Bank also opted to use the $ 1.8 million grant it received from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Rapid Response ‎Program to defray the Grain Receivable. The application of those amounts resulted in no net receivable. Additionally, the Company wrote-off its equity investment in Grain of $ 1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2023, the Company’s total exposure to Grain was $ 1.8 million of the remaining microloans, net of allowance for credit losses, excluding $ 2.4 million of unused commitments available to Grain borrowers and $ 1.4 million of security deposits by Grain borrowers. The $ 0.9 million of recoveries for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and the $ 8.1 million write-off for the three months ended March 31, 2022 related to Grain is included in non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $ 0.9 million of recoveries for the three months ended March 31, 2023, $ 0.5 million were payments received from Grain on the Grain Receivable and the remainder were payments from Grain borrowers. 25 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Grain Technology, Inc.

Excludes $ 1.2 million of security deposits by Grain originated borrowers reported in deposits in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Conditions. Off-Balance Sheet Credit Losses Also included within the scope of the CECL standard are off-balance sheet loan commitments, which includes the unfunded portion of committed lines of credit and construction loans. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the company is exposed to credit risk through a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The Company uses similar assumptions and risk factors that are developed for collectively evaluated financing receivables. This estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments to be funded over its estimated life. At March 31, 2023, the allowance for off-balance sheet credit losses was $ 2.3 million, which is included in the ""Other liabilities"" on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company had $ 1.0 million in credit loss provision for off-balance-sheet items, which are included in ""Provision for contingencies"" on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The following table presents the activity in the allowance for off-balance-sheet credit losses: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Balance at beginning of period $ 354 $ 229 Impact on CECL adoption 948 — Provision 985 17 Allowance for credit losses $ 2,287 $ 246 26 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 5.

Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 consists of the following: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 (in thousands) Federal: Current $ 40 $ ( 1,053 ) Deferred 105 ( 1,715 ) 145 ( 2,768 ) State and local: Current 430 195 Deferred ( 152 ) ( 543 ) 278 ( 348 ) Valuation allowance 123 168 Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 546 $ ( 2,948 ) 30 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Total income tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21 % for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to income before income taxes as a result of the following: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 (in thousands) Income tax, at federal rate $ 184 $ ( 2,051 ) State and local tax, net of federal taxes 220 ( 275 ) Valuation allowance, net of the federal benefit 123 168 Other 19 ( 790 ) $ 546 $ ( 2,948 ) Management maintains a valuation allowance against its net New York State and New York City deferred tax assets as it is unlikely these deferred tax assets will be utilized to reduce the Company's tax liability in future years. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the valuation allowance increased by $ 0.1 million and $ 0.2 million, respectively. In 2022, the Company generated large net operating losses in New York State and New York City which in turn increased the 2022 valuation allowance. Management has determined that it is not required to establish a valuation allowance against any other deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully utilized in future periods. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers the scheduled reversal of the deferred tax liabilities, the level of historical taxable income, and the projected future taxable income over the periods that the temporary differences comprising the deferred tax assets will be deductible. For federal income tax purposes, a financial institution may carry net operating losses (“NOLs”) to forward tax years indefinitely. The use of NOLs to offset income is limited to 80 %. At March 31, 2023 , the Bank had a federal NOL carryforward of $ 12.7 million. The state and city of New York allow for a three-year carryback period and carryforward period of twenty years on NOLs generated on or after tax year 2015. For tax years prior to 2015, no carryback period is allowed. Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, has pre-2015 carryforwards of $ 0.6 million for New York State purposes and $ 0.5 million for New York City purposes. Furthermore, there are post-2015 carryforwards available of $ 63.6 million for New York State purposes and $ 35.5 million for New York City purposes. Finally, for New Jersey purposes, losses may only be carried forward 20 years, with no allowable carryback period. At March 31, 2023 , the Bank had a New Jersey NOL carryforward of $ 0.4 million. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits recorded. The Company does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase in the next twelve months. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax, New York State income tax, Connecticut income tax, New Jersey income tax, Florida income tax, Pennsylvania income tax and New York City income tax. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2019. 31 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are presented below: March 31, December 31, 2023 2022 (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan losses $ 9,485 $ 11,324 Interest on nonaccrual loans 537 317 Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities 4,444 4,777 Amortization of intangible assets 27 32 Operating lease liabilities 11,230 11,304 Net operating losses 9,296 9,119 Charitable contribution carryforward 1,872 1,859 Compensation and benefits 788 562 Other 1,418 478 Total gross deferred tax assets 39,097 39,772 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation of premises and equipment 1,049 1,049 Right of use assets 10,850 10,941 Deferred loan fees 687 671 Other 29 29 Total gross deferred tax liabilities 12,615 12,690 Valuation allowance 11,069 10,945 Net deferred tax assets $ 15,413 $ 16,137 Note 10. Compensation and Benefit Plans Ponce Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions (the “KSOP”) . Effective January 1, 2021, Ponce Bank amended and restated the terms of the Ponce Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “ESOP”) and merged the Ponce Bank 401(k) Plan into the ESOP to form the KSOP. There were no changes to the provisions of the ESOP as discussed below. The KSOP is for eligible employees of Ponce Bank and those of its affiliates. The named executive officers are eligible to participate in the KSOP just like other employees. An employee must attain the age of 21 and will be eligible to participate in the 401(k) features of the KSOP in the quarter following thirty days of service and the ESOP feature of the KSOP upon the first entry date commencing on or after the eligible employee’s completion of one year of service. Employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan at the beginning of each quarter (January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1). 401(k) Component : Under the 401(k) features of the KSOP (“401(k) Component”), a participant may elect to defer, on a pre-tax basis, the maximum amount as permitted by the Internal Revenue Code. For 2023, the salary deferral contribution limit was $ 22,500 ; provided, however, that a participant over age 50 may contribute an additional $ 7,500 to the 401(k) for a total of $ 30,000 . In addition to salary deferral contributions, Ponce Bank may make discretionary matching contributions, discretionary profit sharing contributions or safe harbor contributions to the 401(k) Component. Discretionary matching contributions are allocated on the basis of salary deferral contributions. Discretionary profit sharing contributions are based on three classifications set forth in the 401(k) feature (i) Class A — Chairman, President, and Executive Vice Presidents; (ii) Class B — Senior Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents and Assistant Vice Presidents; and (iii) Class C — all other eligible employees. The contribution for a class will be the same percentage of compensation for all participants in that class. If Ponce Bank decides to make a safe harbor contribution for a plan year, each participant will receive a contribution equal to 3 % of his or her compensation for the plan year. 32 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) A participant is always 100 % vested in his or her salary deferral contributions and safe harbor contributions. Discretionary matching and profit sharing contributions are 20 % vested after two years of service, plus an additional 20 % for each additional year of service; so all participants are fully vested in such contributions after six years of service. Participants also will become fully vested in his or her account balance in the 401(k) Component automatically upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the KSOP. Generally, participants will receive distributions from the KSOP upon separation from service in accordance with the terms of the governing document. ESOP Component: On September 29, 2017, in connection with the Bank’s reorganization into the mutual holding company form of organization, the ESOP trustee purchased, on behalf of the ESOP, 723,751 shares of PDL Community Bancorp common stock. The ESOP funded its stock purchase with a loan (“First ESOP loan”) from PDL Community Bancorp in the amount of $ 7.2 million, which was equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The First ESOP loan is being repaid principally through Ponce Bank’s contributions to the ESOP over the 15 -year term of such loan. The interest rate for the First ESOP loan is 2.60 %. On January 27, 2022, concurrent with the completion of the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from a mutual form to a stock form of organization and the merger of PDL Community Bancorp with and into Ponce Financial Group, Inc., the shares of PDL Community Bancorp common stock held by the KSOP were converted into 977,880 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. On January 27, 2022, the KSOP trustee purchased, on behalf of the ESOP feature of the KSOP (“ESOP Component”), an additional 1,097,353 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock, or 4.44 % of the total number of shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock outstanding on January 27, 2022 (including shares issued to the Foundation). The KSOP funded this stock purchase with a loan (“Second ESOP loan”) from Ponce Financial Group, Inc. in the amount of $ 11.0 million, which was equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The Second ESOP loan is being repaid principally through Ponce Bank’s contributions to the ESOP Component over the 15 -year term of such loan. The interest rate for the Second ESOP loan is 1.82 %. The trustee of the trust funding the KSOP holds the shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock purchased by the KSOP in an unallocated suspense account, and shares will be released from the suspense account on a pro-rata basis as the loans are repaid. The trustee will allocate the shares released among participants on the basis of each participant’s proportional share of qualifying compensation relative to all participants participating in the ESOP Component. A participant will become 100 % vested in his or her account balance in the ESOP Component after three years of service. In addition, participants will become fully vested in his or her account balance in the ESOP Component automatically upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the KSOP. Generally, participants will receive distributions from the KSOP upon separation from service in accordance with the terms of the plan document. The KSOP reallocates any unvested shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock forfeited upon termination of employment among the remaining participants in the ESOP Component. Contributions to the ESOP are to be sufficient to pay principal and interest currently due under the loan agreement. Under applicable accounting requirements, Ponce Bank will record a compensation expense for the ESOP at the average market price of the shares as they are committed to be released from the unallocated suspense account to participants’ accounts, which may be more or less than the original issue price. The compensation expense resulting from the release of the common stock from the suspense account and allocation to plan participants will result in a corresponding reduction in the earnings of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. The ESOP shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations (see Note 11). As of March 31, 2023 , the combined outstanding balance of both the First ESOP loan and Second ESOP loan was $ 13.9 million. A summary of the ESOP shares as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows: March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Shares committed-to-be released 167,180 133,744 Shares allocated to participants 358,630 354,227 Unallocated shares 1,536,040 1,569,475 Total 2,061,850 2,057,446 Fair value of unallocated shares $ 12,058 $ 14,628 The Company recognized ESOP related compensation expense, including ESOP equalization expense, of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 33 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan: The Bank maintains a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) for the benefit of two key executive officers. The SERP expense recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 0.02 million each for one key executive officer. 2018 Incentive Plan The Company’s stockholders approved the PDL Community Bancorp 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2018 Incentive Plan”) at the Special Meeting of Stockholders on October 30, 2018. The maximum number of shares of common stock which can be issued under the 2018 Incentive Plan is 1,248,469 . Of the 1,248,469 shares, the maximum number of shares that may be awarded under the 2018 Incentive Plan pursuant to the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) is 891,764 shares (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options), and the number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units is 356,705 shares. However, the 2018 Incentive Plan contains a flex feature that provides that awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units in excess of the 356,705 share limitation may be granted but each share of stock covered by such excess award shall reduce the 891,764 share limitation for awards of stock options and SARs by 3.0 shares of common stock. The Company converted 462,522 awards of stock options into 154,174 restricted stock units in 2018, 45,000 awards of stock options into 15,000 restricted stock units in 2020 and 191,145 awards of stock options into 63,715 restricted stock units in 2022. Under the 2018 Incentive Plan, the Company made grants equal to 674,645 shares on December 4, 2018 which include 119,176 incentive options to executive officers, 44,590 non-qualified options to outside directors, 322,254 restricted stock units to executive officers, 40,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers and 148,625 restricted stock units to outside directors. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company awarded 40,000 incentive options and 15,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers under the 2018 Incentive Plan. Awards to directors generally vest 20 % annually beginning with the first anniversary of the date of grant. Awards to a director with fewer than five years of service at the time of grant vest over a longer period and will not become fully vested until the director has completed ten years of service. Awards to the executive officer who is not a director vest 20 % annually beginning on December 4, 2020. On April 1, 2022, the Company awarded 23,718 incentive options to an executive officer, 30,659 incentive options to non-executive officers and 13,952 non-qualified options to an outside director. In addition, on April 1, 2022 the Company awarded 40,460 restricted stock units to executive officers and 23,255 restricted stock units to outside directors. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023 , the maximum number of stock options and SARs remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan for both periods was 4,883 , after the conversion from PDL Community Bancorp common stock to Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock or restricted stock units remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was none , for both periods. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determine the fair value of restricted stock units under the Company’s 2018 Incentive Plan. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. 34 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) A summary of the Company’s restricted stock unit awards activity and related information for three months ended March 31, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022 are as follows: March 31, 2023 Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested, beginning of year 245,840 $ 9.40 Granted — — Vested ( 4,147 ) 9.27 Forfeited — — Non-vested at March 31 241,693 $ 9.40 December 31, 2022 Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested, beginning of year 237,687 $ 12.65 Conversion and reorganization 93,933 — Granted 63,715 10.44 Vested ( 149,495 ) 9.11 Forfeited — — Non-vested at December 31 245,840 $ 9.40 Compensation expense related to restricted stock units was $ 0.4 million and $ 0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.

Earnings Per Share The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 (Dollars in thousands except share data) Net income (loss) $ 331 $ ( 6,820 ) Common shares outstanding for basic EPS: Weighted average common shares outstanding 24,862,118 22,744,101 Less: Weighted average unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) shares 1,569,105 1,022,988 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 23,293,013 21,721,113 Basic earnings (loss) per common share $ 0.01 $ ( 0.31 ) Potential dilutive common shares: Add: Dilutive effect of restricted stock awards and stock options 31,519 — Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 23,324,532 21,721,113 Diluted earnings (loss) per common share $ 0.01 $ ( 0.31 ) Note 12. Commitments, Contingencies and Credit Risk Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk : In the normal course of business, financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk may be used to meet the financing needs of customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized 36 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement in particular classes of financial instruments. The contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit represent the amounts of potential accounting loss should the contract be fully drawn upon, the customer default, and the value of any existing collateral become worthless. The same credit policies are used in making commitments and contractual obligations as for on-balance-sheet instruments. Financial instruments whose contractual amounts represent credit risk at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows: March 31, December 31, 2023 2022 (in thousands) Commitments to grant mortgage loans $ 306,709 $ 207,105 Commitments to sell loans at lock-in rates 4,888 1,676 Unfunded commitments under lines of credit 67,228 72,530 $ 378,825 $ 281,311 Commitments to Grant Mortgage Loans : Commitments to grant mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as all terms and conditions are met as established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties. Material losses are not anticipated as a result of these transactions. Commitments to Sell Loans at Lock-in Rates: In order to assure itself of a marketplace to sell its loans, Mortgage World has agreements with investors who will commit to purchase loans at locked-in rates. Mortgage World has off-balance sheet market risk to the extent that Mortgage World does not obtain matching commitments from these investors to purchase the loans. This will expose Mortgage World to the lower of cost or market valuation environment. Repurchases, Indemnifications and Premium Recaptures : Loans sold by Mortgage World under investor programs are subject to repurchase or indemnification if they fail to meet the origination criteria of those programs. In addition, loans sold to investors are also subject to repurchase or indemnifications if the loan is two or three months delinquent during a set period which usually varies from six months to a year after the loan is sold. There are no open repurchase or indemnification requests for loans sold as a correspondent lender or where the Company acted as a broker in the transaction as of March 31, 2023. Unfunded Commitments Under Lines of Credit : Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extension of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit are uncollateralized and usually contain a specified maturity date and, ultimately, may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed. Unfunded Commitments with Bamboo : On October 1, 2022, the Bank entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Bamboo Payment Holding LLC (""Bamboo""). Under the agreement, the Bank purchased from Bamboo 180 Membership Interest Units representing an aggregate amount equal to up to 18 % of total issued and outstanding Membership Interest in Bamboo for a purchase price of $ 2.5 million. During the first quarter of 2023, the Bank made an additional contribution of $ 0.5 million for a total investment in Bamboo of $ 3.0 million. With over a decade processing payments in Latin America, Bamboo has a diverse network connects Latin American local payment processing to global companies as well as domestic solutions to locally based organizations. Unfunded Commitments with Oaktree : In December of 2021, the Bank committed to invest $ 5.0 million in Oaktree SBIC Fund, L.P. (""Oaktree""). As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total unfunded commitment was $ 2.4 million and $ 2.8 million, respectively. Unfunded Commitments with Silvergate : In April of 2022, the Bank committed to invest $ 5.0 million in EJF Silvergate Ventures Fund LP (""Silvergate""). As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total unfunded commitment was $ 2.7 million and $ 3.3 million, respectively. Letters of Credit : Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Letters of credit are largely cash secured. 37 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Concentration by Geographic Location : Loans, commitments to extend credit and letters of credit have been granted to customers who are located primarily in the New York City metropolitan area. Generally, such loans most often are secured by one-to-four family residential properties. The loans are expected to be repaid from the borrowers' cash flows. Legal Matters : The Company is involved in various legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal course of business. Management believes that resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Note 13. Fair Value The following fair value hierarchy is used based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2 – Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: Cash and Cash Equivalents, Placements with Banks, Accrued Interest Receivable, Advance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance, and Accrued Interest Payable : The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. These assets and liabilities are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Available-for-Sale Securities : These financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models (e.g., matrix pricing) or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Examples of such instruments include government agency bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Level 3 securities are securities for which significant unobservable inputs are utilized. There were no changes in valuation techniques used to measure similar assets during the period. FHLBNY Stock : The carrying value of FHLBNY stock approximates fair value since the Bank can redeem such stock with FHLBNY at cost. As a member of the FHLBNY, the Company is required to purchase this stock, which is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. Loans Receivable : For variable rate loans, which reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, carrying values are a reasonable estimate of fair values, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using estimated market rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. Impaired loans are valued using a present value discounted cash flow method, or the fair value of the collateral. Loans are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale : Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, consists of mortgage loans originated for sale by Mortgage World and accounted for under the fair value option. These assets are valued using stated investor pricing for substantially equivalent loans as Level 2. In determining fair value, such measurements are derived based on observable market data, including whole-loan transaction pricing and similar market transactions adjusted for portfolio composition, servicing value and market conditions. Loans held for sale by the Bank are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by investor bid prices. Under the fair value option, management has elected, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, fair value for substantially all forms of mortgage loans originated for sale on a recurring basis. The fair value carrying amount of mortgages held for sale measured under the fair value option was $ 3.0 million and the aggregate unpaid principal amounted to $ 3.0 million. Interest Rate Lock Commitments : The Bank, through its Mortgage World division, enters into rate lock commitments to extend credit to borrowers for generally up to a 60 day period for origination and/or purchase of loans. To the extent that a loan is ultimately granted and the borrower ultimately accepts the terms of the loan, these loan commitments expose the Bank’s Mortgage World division to variability in its fair value due to changes in interest rates. 38 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The FASB determined that loan commitments related to the origination or acquisition of mortgage loans that will be held for sale must be accounted for as derivative instruments. Such commitments, along with any related fees received from potential borrowers, are recorded at fair value in derivative assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in income on sale of mortgage loans. Fair value is based on active market pricing for substantially similar underlying mortgage loans commonly referred to as best execution pricing or investment commitment pricing, if the loan is committed to an investor through a best efforts contract. In valuing interest rate lock commitments, there are several unobservable inputs such as the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights, estimated remaining cost to originate the loans, and the pull through rate of the open pipeline. Accordingly, such derivative is classified as Level 3. The approximate notional amounts of Mortgage World’s derivative instruments were $ 4.9 million and $ 1.7 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The fair value of derivatives related to interest rate lock commitments not subject to a forward loan sale commitment, amounted to $ 0.1 million and $ 0.02 million as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and is included in other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The table below presents the changes in derivatives from interest rate lock commitments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: (in thousands) Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 22 Change in fair value of derivative instrument reported in earnings 97 Balance as of March 31, 2023 $ 119 Other Real Estate Owned : Other real estate owned represents real estate acquired through foreclosure, and is recorded at fair value less estimated disposal costs on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the asset is classified as Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the asset is classified as Level 3. Deposits : The fair values of demand deposits, savings, NOW and money market accounts equal their carrying amounts, which represent the amounts payable on demand at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-term, fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates on certificates of deposit to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on such deposits. Deposits are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. FHLBNY Advances : The fair value of the advances is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current market-based FHLBNY interest rates for advances of similar maturity to a schedule of maturities of such advances. These borrowings are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Warehouse Lines of Credit : The carrying amounts of warehouse lines of credit and mortgage loan funding payable approximate fair value and due to their short-term nature are classified as Level 2. One of the warehouse lines of credit was terminated on March 31, 2022 and one was terminated on February 7, 2023 Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments : Fair values for off-balance-sheet instruments (lending commitments and standby letters of credit) are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit standing. Off-balance-sheet instruments are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 39 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following tables detail the assets that are carried at fair value and measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and indicate the level within the fair value hierarchy utilized to determine the fair value: March 31, 2023 Description Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities, at fair value: U.S. Government Bonds $ 2,746 $ 2,746 $ — $ — Corporate bonds 23,177 649 22,528 — Mortgage-Backed Securities: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 37,391 — 37,391 — FHLMC Certificates 9,546 9,546 FNMA Certificates 55,345 — 55,345 — GNMA Certificates 115 — 115 — Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at fair value 2,987 — 2,987 — Derivatives from interest rate lock commitments 119 — — 119 $ 131,426 $ 3,395 $ 127,912 $ 119 December 31, 2022 Description Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities, at fair value: U.S. Government Bonds $ 2,689 $ 2,689 $ — $ — Corporate bonds 23,359 730 22,629 — Mortgage-Backed Securities: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 37,777 — 37,777 — FHLMC Certificates 9,634 9,634 FNMA Certificates 55,928 — 55,928 — GNMA Certificates 118 — 118 — Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at fair value 1,979 — 1,979 — Derivatives from interest rate lock commitments 22 — — 22 $ 131,506 $ 3,419 $ 128,065 $ 22 Management’s assessment and classification of an investment within a level can change over time based upon maturity or liquidity of the investment and would be reflected at the beginning of the quarter in which the change occurred.

There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 assets or liabilities in the fair value hierarchy at March 31, 2023 and one security transferred out of Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2022. Fair value for Level 3 securities was determined using a third-party pricing service with limited levels of activity and price transparency. Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments : Loan commitments on which the committed interest rate is less than the current market rate are insignificant at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The fair value information about financial instruments are disclosed, whether or not recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. The estimated fair value amounts for 2023 and 2022 have been measured as of their respective period-ends and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these consolidated financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than amounts reported at each period. The information presented should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only required for a limited portion of the Company's assets and liabilities. Due to the wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company's disclosures and those of other banks may not be meaningful. Note 14. Regulatory Capital Requirements The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain 42 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s operations and financial statements. Under the regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total risk-based and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (as defined), common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined), and Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets (as defined) adjusted total assets (as defined). As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the applicable capital adequacy requirements specified below have been met. The below minimum capital requirements exclude the capital conservation buffer required to avoid limitations on capital distributions including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The applicable capital buffer for the Bank was 19.54 % at March 31, 2023 and 22.53 % at December 31, 2022. The most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Company and the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, common equity risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There were no conditions or events since then that have changed the Bank's category. The Company's and the Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 as compared to regulatory requirements are as follows: To Be Well Capitalized Under For Capital Prompt Corrective Actual Adequacy Purposes Action Provisions Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (Dollars in thousands) March 31, 2023 Ponce Financial Group, Inc.

Failure to maintain minimum capital requirements could result in the Bank’s Mortgage World division being unable to originate and service loans, and, therefore, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Aggregate loan transactions with related parties for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 (in thousand) Beginning balance (1) $ 8,318 $ 5,631 Originations (1) 578 4,048 Payments ( 65 ) ( 1,475 ) Ending balance $ 8,831 $ 8,204 The Company held deposits in the amount of $ 7.9 million and $ 8.0 million from directors, executive officers and non-executive officers at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. 44 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. (the “Company”). The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in Part I, Item 1, of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""intend,"" ""anticipate,"" ""assume,"" ""plan,"" ""seek,"" ""expect,"" ""will,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""indicate,"" ""would,"" ""believe,"" ""contemplate,"" ""continue,"" ""target"" and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: These forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company’s control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 45 Additional factors that may affect the Company’s results are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 under the heading “Risk Factors” filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 21, 2023. Because of these and other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. The Company is under no duty to and does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following discussion contains certain non-GAAP financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide the reader with additional supplemental perspective on operating results, performance trends, and financial condition. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial information. The Company’s non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP information which may be presented by other companies. In all cases, it should be understood that non-GAAP operating measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders. An item that management excludes when computing non-GAAP adjusted earnings can be of substantial importance to the Company’s results and condition for any particular year. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided below. The SEC has exempted from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on GAAP. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. However, the information should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The table below includes references to the Company's net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 before the Company’s contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation. In management's view, that information, which is considered non-GAAP information, may be useful to investors as it will improve an understanding of core operations for the current and future periods. The non-GAAP net income (loss) amount and earnings (loss) per share reflect adjustments related to the non-recurring gain on sale of real property and the Company’s contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation, net of tax effect. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP information to GAAP net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share is provided below. Non-GAAP Reconciliation – Net Income (Loss) before the Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net income (loss) - GAAP $ 331 $ (6,820 ) Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation — 4,995 Income tax (benefit) provision — (1,049 ) Net income (loss) - non-GAAP $ 331 $ (2,874 ) Earnings (loss) per common share (GAAP) (1) $ 0.01 $ (0.31 ) Earnings (loss) per common share (non-GAAP) (1) $ 0.01 $ (0.13 ) 46 The CARES Act On March 27, 2020, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) to address the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act appropriated $349.0 billion for PPP loans and on April 24, 2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) received another $310.0 billion in PPP funding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act appropriated $284.0 billion for both first and second draw PPP loans, bringing the total appropriations for PPP loans to $943.0 billion. PPP ended on May 31, 2021. Loans under the PPP that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The Company had received SBA approval and originated 5,340 PPP loans, of which 9 loans totaling $3.6 million were outstanding at March 31, 2023. PPP loans have a two-year or five-year term, provide for fees of up to 5% of the loan amount and earn interest at a rate of 1% per annum. It is our expectation that a significant portion of these remaining loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. Federal Economic Relief Funds To Aid Lending On June 7, 2022, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. (the “Company”), the holding company for Ponce Bank,‎ closed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 225,000 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A‎, par value $0.01 (the “Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price equal to $225,000,000 in cash, to the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) pursuant to the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”).‎ The holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a dividend payable in cash quarterly at an annual rate dependent on certain factors as reported by the Company to Treasury in a quarterly supplemental report. The initial dividend rate is zero percent for the first two years after issuance, and thereafter the floor dividend rate is 0.50% and the ceiling dividend rate is 2.00%. After 10 years of issuance, the perpetual dividend rate in effect, will be determined based on said floor and ceiling. The actual dividend rate that will be paid by the Company on the Preferred Stock cannot be determined at this time. The ECIP investment by the Treasury is part of a program to invest over $8.7 billion into Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) or ‎Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), of which Ponce Bank is both. The ECIP is intended to incentivize CDFIs and MDIs to provide loans, grants, ‎and forbearance to small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers in low-income and underserved communities that may have been ‎disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. CDFI Equitable Recovery Program The Bank has been awarded a $3.7 million grant from the U.S. Treasury as part of the Community Development Financial Institutions (""CDFI"") Equitable Recovery Program (""ERP"") which aims to help CDFI's further their mission of helping low and low-to-moderate income communities recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. Treasury indicated that the grant would be disbursed in June 2023 and its utilization would be subject to eligible activities and reporting in accordance with the ERP program. Critical Accounting Policies Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management and that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets, liabilities or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is established as probable incurred losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under 47 different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. See Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the accompanying Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. Factors Affecting the Comparability of Results Ponce De Leon Foundation. On January 27, 2022, the Company made a $5.0 million contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation as part of the conversion and reorganization, which is included in non-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Write-off and Write-Down. In 2020, the Company entered into a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain. Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to $1,500 and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originates and services these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan is found to be fraudulent, becomes 90 days delinquent upon 90 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.” The Bank, pursuant to its agreement with Grain, at December 31, 2022, had 27,886 microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with credit extensions aggregating $18.2 million. At March 31, 2023, the Bank had 22,859 Grain microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $13.4 million and which were performing, in management’s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by an $11.6 million allowance for credit losses, resulting in $1.8 million in Grain microloans. Since the beginning of the Bank’s agreement with Grain and through March 31, 2023, 45,322 microloans amounting to $25.1 million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain. The Company has written-down a total of $16.5 million, net of recoveries, of the Grain Receivable and received $6.7 million in cash from Grain and through the application of security deposits connected to fraudulent loan accounts. The Bank also opted to use the $1.8 million grant it received from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Rapid Response ‎Program to defray the Grain Receivable. The application of those amounts resulted in no net receivable. Additionally, the Company wrote-off its equity investment in Grain of $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2023, the Company’s total exposure to Grain was $1.8 million of the remaining microloans, net of allowance for credit losses, excluding $2.4 million of unused commitments available to Grain borrowers and $1.4 million of security deposits by Grain borrowers. The $0.9 million of recoveries for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and the $8.1 million write-off for the three months ended March 31, 2022 related to Grain is included in non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the $0.9 million of recoveries for the three months ended March 31, 2023, $0.5 million were payments received from Grain on the Grain Receivable and the remainder were payments from Grain borrowers. 48 Grain Technology, Inc.

Grain has been victimized by cyber fraud using synthetic and other forms of fraudulent identifications, a phenomenon that has become prevalent with Fintechs. Grain remains a pre-profit startup highly dependent on earnings from its relationship with the Bank, a new relationship with another financial institution, and further capital raises which may not materialize. The Company continues to closely monitor its portfolio of consumer loans originated by Grain as well as Grain’s refinement of solutions for detecting and preventing cyber fraud in the application for microloans. The Company has requested, and Grain has agreed, that no new microloans be originated until further notice and that further extensions of credit to an existing microloan borrower only be made upon confirmation that such borrower is not fraudulent. Further, like other start-up companies, there is a higher level of risk that Grain may not be able to execute its business plan and may fail. In the event Grain were to cease operations, and although it has considered contingency plans, the Bank may have greater difficulty in servicing and collecting the microloan portfolio. In such a case, the level the Bank has provided for in its allowance for credit losses for its microloan portfolio may be inadequate and it may need to increase its provision for credit losses, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. As a consequence of such events, the Bank may determine it appropriate to terminate its relationship with Grain. Vision 2025 Evolves The Company has deployed a Fintech-based small business automated lending technology in partnership with LendingFront Technologies, Inc. The technology is a mobile application that digitizes the lending workflow from pre-approval to servicing and enables the Company to originate, close and fund small business loans within very short spans of time, without requiring a physical presence within banking offices and with automated underwriting using both traditional and non-traditional methods. The application has full loan origination and servicing capabilities and is integrated with Salesforce. All Commercial Relationship Officers and Business Development Managers will utilize these capabilities. The Company is seeking to establish loan origination partnerships with non-profit and community-based organizations to ensure penetration in underserved and underbanked markets. The Company also established a relationship with SaveBetter, LLC, a fintech startup focusing on brokered deposits. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had $152.9 million in such deposits. The recent regulatory easing of brokered deposit rules may enable the Company to classify such deposits as core deposits. On October 1, 2022, Ponce Bank entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Bamboo Payment Holding LLC (""Bamboo""). Under this agreement, Ponce Bank purchased from Bamboo 180 Membership Interest Units representing an aggregate amount equal to up to 18% of total issued and outstanding Membership Interest in Bamboo for a purchase price of $2.5 million. During the first quarter of 2023, the Bank made an additional contribution of $0.5 million for a total investment in Bamboo of $3.0 million. With over a decade processing payments in Latin America, Bamboo has a diverse network connects Latin American local payment processing to global companies as well as domestic solutions to locally based organizations. 49 At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $1.06 billion in assets, $918.5 million in loans and $809.8 million in deposits. The Company has since grown to $2.54 billion in assets, $1.61 billion in loans receivables, net of allowance for credit losses of $29.0 million, and $1.34 billion in deposits at March 31, 2023, all while investing in infrastructure, implementing digital banking, acquiring Mortgage World, adopting GPS, diversifying its product offering, partnering with Fintech companies and assisting its communities with 5,340 PPP loans totaling $261.4 million. The Company raised over $132.0 million in additional capital through our conversion and reorganization and realized approximately $20.0 million in net gain while freeing up approximately $40.0 million in investable funds through our sale-and-leaseback initiative. Now, the Company believes that it is poised to enhance its presence, locally and in similar communities outside New York, as a leading CDFI and MDI financial institution holding company. On June 7, 2022, the Company issued 225,000 shares of the Company’s Preferred Stock‎, par value $0.01 for an aggregate purchase price equal to $225.0 million in cash to the Treasury, pursuant to the Treasury’s ECIP‎. Under the ECIP, Treasury provided investment capital directly to depository institutions that are CDFIs or MDIs or their holding companies, to provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers, in low-income and underserved communities. Treasury has indicated that the investment will qualify as Tier 1 capital. No dividends will accrue or be due for the first two years after issuance. For years three through ten, depending upon the level of qualified and/or deep impact lending made in targeted communities, as defined in the ECIP guidelines, dividends will be at an annual rate of either 2.0%, 1.25% or 0.5% and, thereafter, will be fixed at one of the foregoing rates. Holders of Preferred Stock generally do not have any voting rights, with the exception of voting rights on certain matters as outlined in the Certificate of Designations. The Company has the option to redeem the shares of Preferred Stock (i) in whole or in part on any dividend payment date on or after June 15, 2027, or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within ninety days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, as defined below, in each case at a cash redemption price equal to the liquidation amount, with an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not paid prior to the redemption date. The Company may not redeem shares of Preferred Stock without having received the prior approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency for the Company, as defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, to the extent required under applicable capital rules. Such redemptions are subject to certain conditions and limitations. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. A “Regulatory Capital Treatment Event” means a good-faith determination that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws, rules or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any agency or instrumentality of the United States, including the Federal Reserve and other appropriate federal bank regulatory agencies) that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any share of the Preferred Stock; (ii) any proposed change in those laws, rules or regulations that is announced after the initial issuance of any share of the Preferred Stock; or (iii) any official administrative or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws, rules or regulations or policies with respect thereto that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of the Preferred Stock, there is more than an insubstantial risk that we will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation preferences of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding as “Additional Tier 1 Capital” (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy standards of Federal Reserve Regulation Q, 12 C.F.R. Part 217 (or, as and if applicable, the successor capital adequacy guidelines, rules or regulations of the Federal Reserve or the capital adequacy guidelines, rules or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency), as then in effect and applicable, for as long as any share of Preferred Stock is outstanding. Comparison of Financial Condition at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 Total Assets . Total consolidated assets increased $227.5 million, or 9.8%, to $2.54 billion at March 31, 2023 from $2.31 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in total assets is largely attributable to increases of $130.3 million in cash and cash equivalent, $121.3 million in net loans receivable, $1.8 million in other assets and $1.0 million in mortgage loans held for sale. The increase in total assets is partially offset by decreases of $19.2 million in held-to-maturity securities, $5.5 million in FHLBNY stock and $1.2 million in available-for-sale securities. Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents increased $130.3 million, or 239.7%, to $184.7 million at March 31, 2023, compared to $54.4 million at December 31, 2022. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of an increase of $131.0 million in net borrowings, an increase of $84.5 million in net deposits and proceeds of $21.1 million from maturities/calls of securities, offset by an increase of $117.9 million in net loans. 50 Securities.

The decrease was primarily due to a call on one of the securities and changes in principal. 51 Gross Loans Receivable. The composition of gross loans receivable at March 31, 2023 and at December 31, 2022 and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows: March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Increase (Decrease) Amount Percent Amount Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential Investor-Owned $ 354,559 21.6 % $ 343,968 22.6 % $ 10,591 3.1 % Owner-Occupied 149,481 9.1 % 134,878 8.8 % 14,603 10.8 % Multifamily residential 553,430 33.7 % 494,667 32.4 % 58,763 11.9 % Nonresidential properties 314,560 19.2 % 308,043 20.2 % 6,517 2.1 % Construction and land 235,157 14.3 % 185,018 12.1 % 50,139 27.1 % Total mortgage loans 1,607,187 97.9 % 1,466,574 96.1 % 140,613 9.6 % Nonmortgage loans: Business loans (1) 19,890 1.2 % 39,965 2.6 % (20,075 ) (50.2 %) Consumer loans (2) 14,227 0.9 % 19,129 1.3 % (4,902 ) (25.6 %) 34,117 2.1 % 59,094 3.9 % (24,977 ) (42.3 %) Total $ 1,641,304 100.0 % $ 1,525,668 100.0 % $ 115,636 7.6 % Based on current internal loan reviews, the Company believes that the quality of our underwriting, our weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 58.8% and our customer selection processes have served us well and provided us with a reliable base with which to maintain a well-protected loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans, as defined by applicable banking regulations, include multifamily residential, nonresidential properties, and construction and land mortgage loans. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximately 5.7% and 6.4%, respectively, of the outstanding principal balance of the Bank’s commercial real estate mortgage loans were secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses predominantly on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on valuation of the real estate. Banking regulations have established guidelines relating to the amount of construction and land mortgage loans and investor- owned commercial real estate mortgage loans of 100% and 300% of total risk-based capital, respectively. Should a bank’s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. The Bank’s policy is to operate within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and up to 400% for investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank’s total risk-based capital. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Bank’s construction and land mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 48.6% and 38.5%, respectively. Investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 229.2% and 194.0% as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. At March 31, 2023, the Bank was within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and the 300% guideline for investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans established by banking regulators. Management believes that it has established the appropriate level of controls to monitor the Bank’s lending in these areas. Mortgage Loans Held For Sale . Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, at March 31, 2023 increased $1.0 million, or 50.9%, to $3.0 million from $2.0 million at December 31, 2022. 52 Deposits. The composition of deposits at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and changes in dollars and percentages are summarized as follows: March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Increase (Decrease) Percent Percent Amount of Total Amount of Total Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Demand $ 282,741 21.1 % $ 289,149 23.1 % $ (6,408 ) (2.2 %) Interest-bearing deposits: NOW/IOLA accounts 21,735 1.6 % 24,349 1.9 % (2,614 ) (10.7 %) Money market accounts 408,404 30.5 % 317,815 25.4 % 90,589 28.5 % Reciprocal deposits 109,649 8.2 % 114,049 9.1 % (4,400 ) (3.9 %) Savings accounts 127,731 9.6 % 130,432 10.4 % (2,701 ) (2.1 %) Total NOW, money market, reciprocal and savings 667,519 49.9 % 586,645 46.8 % 80,874 13.8 % Certificates of deposit of $250K or more 76,893 5.8 % 70,113 5.6 % 6,780 9.7 % Brokered certificates of deposit (1) 98,754 7.4 % 98,754 7.9 % - 0.0 % Listing service deposits (1) 28,417 2.1 % 35,813 2.9 % (7,396 ) (20.7 %) Certificates of deposit less than $250K 182,553 13.7 % 171,938 13.7 % 10,615 6.2 % Total certificates of deposit 386,617 29.0 % 376,618 30.1 % 9,999 2.7 % Total interest-bearing deposits 1,054,136 78.9 % 963,263 76.9 % 90,873 9.4 % Total deposits $ 1,336,877 100.0 % $ 1,252,412 100.0 % $ 84,465 6.7 % When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the Company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk and interest rate risk in line with management objectives. The Company’s Interest Rate Risk Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding and noncore funding reliance. The overall reliance on wholesale funding and noncore funding were within those policy limitations as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Management Asset/Liability Committee generally meets on a bi-weekly basis to review funding needs, if any, and to ensure the Company operates within the approved limitations. Borrowings . The Bank had outstanding borrowings at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 of $648.4 million and $517.4 million in term advances from the FHLBNY and FRBNY, respectively. The Bank had no overnight line of credit advance at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Stockholders’ Equity . The Company’s consolidated stockholders’ equity increased $3.3 million, or 0.7%, to $496.0 million at March 31, 2023 from $492.7 million at December 31, 2022. This increase in stockholders’ equity was largely attributable to the $1.2 million in other comprehensive income and $1.1 million in adoption of CECL. Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 The discussion of the Company’s results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 are presented below. The results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of future results. Overview. Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $0.3 million compared to net loss of ($6.8) million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Earnings per basic and diluted share was $0.01 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to loss per basic and diluted share of ($0.31) for three months ended March 31, 2022. The $7.2 million increase of net income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was due to decreases of $11.7 million in non-interest expenses and $1.4 million in provision for loan losses, offset by an increase of a $3.5 million in provision for income taxes and decreases of $2.1 million in net interest income and $0.4 million of non-interest income. 53 The following table presents the results of operations for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended March 31, Increase (Decrease) 2023 2022 Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Interest and dividend income $ 26,356 $ 19,018 $ 7,338 38.6 % Interest expense 11,111 1,680 9,431 561.4 % Net interest income 15,245 17,338 (2,093 ) (12.1 %) Provision for loan losses (174 ) 1,258 (1,432 ) (113.8 %) Net interest income after provision for loan losses 15,419 16,080 (661 ) (4.1 %) Non-interest income 1,819 2,226 (407 ) (18.3 %) Non-interest expense 16,361 28,074 (11,713 ) (41.7 %) Income (loss) before income taxes 877 (9,768 ) 10,645 (109.0 %) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 546 (2,948 ) 3,494 (118.5 %) Net income (loss) $ 331 $ (6,820 ) $ 7,151 (104.9 %) Earnings (loss) per share: Basic $ 0.01 $ (0.31 ) $ 0.33 (104.5 %) Diluted $ 0.01 $ (0.31 ) $ 0.33 (104.5 %) Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $7.3 million, or 38.6%, to $26.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from $19.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Interest income on loans receivable, which is the Company’s primary source of income, increased $1.5 million, or 8.2%, to $19.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from $18.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks increased $5.8 million, or 713.7%, to $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The following table presents interest income on loans receivable for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) 1-4 Family residential $ 6,053 $ 5,180 $ 873 16.9 % Multifamily residential 6,096 3,839 2,257 58.8 % Nonresidential properties 3,673 3,084 589 19.1 % Construction and land 2,762 2,099 663 31.6 % Business loans 588 2,470 (1,882 ) (76.2 %) Consumer loans 528 1,528 (1,000 ) (65.4 %) Total interest income on loans receivable $ 19,700 $ 18,200 $ 1,500 8.2 % The following table presents interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Interest on deposits due from banks $ 197 $ 37 $ 160 432.4 % Interest on securities 6,075 716 5,359 748.5 % Dividend on FHLBNY stock 384 65 319 490.8 % Total interest and dividend income $ 6,656 $ 818 $ 5,838 713.7 % Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $9.4 million, or 561.4%, to $11.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase average cost of funds. 54 For the Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Certificates of deposit $ 1,871 $ 802 $ 1,069 133.3 % Money market 4,125 236 3,889 1,647.9 % Savings 30 32 (2 ) (6.3 %) NOW/IOLA 9 16 (7 ) (43.8 %) Advance payments by borrowers 2 1 1 100.0 % Borrowings 5,074 593 4,481 755.6 % Total interest expense $ 11,111 $ 1,680 $ 9,431 561.4 % Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased $2.1 million, or 12.1%, to $15.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from $17.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The 2.1 million decrease in net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was attributable to an increase of $9.4 million in interest expense due primarily to a higher average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities, offset by an increase of $7.3 million in interest and dividend income primarily due to increases in average loans receivable and interest and dividend on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks . Net interest rate spread decreased by 269 basis point to 1.79% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from 4.48% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease in the net interest rate spread for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 231 basis points to 2.97% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from 0.66% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and a decrease in the average yields on interest-earning assets of 37 basis points to 4.76% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from 5.14% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Net interest margin decreased 193 basis points for the three months ended March 31, 2023, to 2.75% from 4.68% for three months ended March 31, 2022, reflecting an increase in our securities portfolio and our organic loan growth. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.00%-5.25% during its May 4, 2023 meeting, pushing borrowing costs to the highest level since 2007. The Federal Reserve has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. The Bank believes it is well positioned to withstand this rising interest rate environment in the near term as it is asset sensitive. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income decreased 0.4 million, or 18.3%, to $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease in non-interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was attributable to decreases of $0.6 million in loan origination fees, $0.3 million in income on sale of mortgage loans and $0.3 million in brokerage commission, partially offset by an increase of $0.7 million in late and prepayment charges.

The most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of the Bank’s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of its financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. The Bank’s Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in the Bank’s assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given the business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with policies and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank currently utilizes a third-party modeling solution that is prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate its sensitivity to changing interest rates, given the Bank’s business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank does not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities. Mortgage World did not engage in hedging activities to cover the risks of interest rate movements while it held mortgages for sale. The then low mortgage interest rates and their limited volatility had effectively mitigated such risks. Net Interest Income Simulation Models . Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software that measures the Bank’s earnings through simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, the Bank has policy guidelines for earnings risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest 58 rates. As of March 31, 2023, in the event of an instantaneous upward and downward change in rates from management's interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated: Net Interest Income Year 1 Change Rate Shift (1) Year 1 Forecast from Level (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 67,461 (0.21%) +300 67,404 (0.29%) +200 67,380 (0.33%) +100 67,429 (0.26%) Level 67,602 — % -100 68,230 0.93% Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The behavior of the deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in the projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the benefit in those scenarios. At March 31, 2023, the earnings simulation model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Economic Value of Equity Model . While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to net interest income, the Economic Value of Equity Model (“EVE”) measures estimated changes to the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. Rates are then shocked as prescribed by the Interest Rate Risk Policy to measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Interest Rate Risk Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At March 31, 2023, the EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: EVE as a Percentage of Present Value of Assets (3) Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Increase Change in Interest Estimated EVE EVE (Decrease) Rates (basis points) (1) EVE (2) Amount Percent Ratio (4) (basis points) (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 409,410 $ (63,600 ) (13.45 %) 17.87 % (1,345 ) +300 425,593 (47,417 ) (10.02 %) 18.20 % (1,002 ) +200 441,444 (31,566 ) (6.67 %) 18.50 % (667 ) +100 458,445 (14,565 ) (3.08 %) 18.82 % (308 ) Level 473,010 — — % 19.03 % — -100 502,675 29,665 6.27 % 19.69 % 627 Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 59 At March 31, 2023, the EVE model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors’ approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Most Likely Earnings Simulation Models . Management also analyzes a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress the balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management and weighted to determine the most likely result. These processes assist management to better anticipate financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to review other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. The Asset/Liability Committee reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing and capital policies. Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in the Bank’s regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behaviors that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from the Bank’s historical studies of financial instruments and the best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into Bank’s asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare its results to other banks. The Asset/Liability Management Committee may determine that the Company should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and its conclusions regarding interest rate fluctuations in future periods. The historically low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response the turmoil resulting from COVID-19 pandemic has ended. The Federal Reserve Board increased the benchmark federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.00% - 5.25% at its May 4, 2023 mee ting . The Federal Reserve Board has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. The Bank believes it is well positioned to withstand this rising interest rate environment in the near term as it is asset sensitive. GAP Analysis . In addition, management analyzes interest rate sensitivity by monitoring the Bank’s interest rate sensitivity ""gap."" The interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing-liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period, and a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period. The following table sets forth the Company’s interest-earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities at March 31, 2023, which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown based upon certain assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities 60 at March 31, 2023, on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments. The loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable-rate loans.

Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and EVE tables presented assume that the composition of the interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income and EVE tables provide an indication of the interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on 61 net interest income and EVE and will differ from actual results. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table. Interest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of loans, deposits and borrowings. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity describes the ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Company’s customers and to fund current and future planned expenditures. The primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and available-for-sale securities and proceeds from the sale of loans. The Bank also has access to borrow from the FHLBNY and the FRBNY. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Bank had $648.4 million and $517.4 million, respectively, of term and overnight outstanding advances from the FHLBNY and the FRBNY, and also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through letters of credit of up to $9.3 million as of March 31, 2023 and $21.5 million as of December 31, 2022. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there was eligible collateral of approximately $529.7 million and $478.8 million, respectively, in mortgage loans available to secure advances from the FHLBNY. The Bank also has two unsecured lines of credit of $90.0 million with two correspondent banks, of which there was none outstanding at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Bank did not have any outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements with brokers as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Although maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The most liquid assets are cash and interest-bearing deposits in banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $6.1 million and $12.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations, purchases of new securities, and purchase of equipment offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed securities, and proceeds from the sale of real estate was ($91.3) million and ($44.8) million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting of activities in borrowing and deposit accounts, was $215.5 million and ($51.8) million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Based on the Company’s current assessment of the economic impact of rising interest rates, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and current global and regional market conditions on its borrowers, management has determined that these may be a detriment to borrowers’ ability to repay in the short-term and that the likelihood of long-term detrimental effects will depend significantly on the resolution of these factors and the resumption of normalized economic activities, a factor not yet determinable. The Bank’s management also took steps to enhance the Company’s liquidity position by increasing its on balance sheet cash and cash equivalents position in order to meet unforeseen liquidity events and to fund upcoming funding needs. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, all regulatory capital requirements were met, resulting in the Company and the Bank being categorized as well capitalized at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change this categorization. Material Cash Requirements Commitments . As a financial services provider, the Company routinely is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. Although these contractual obligations represent the Company’s future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans originated. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans and extend credit of $378.8 million and $281.3 million, respectively. It is anticipated that the Company will have sufficient funds available to meet its current lending commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in 2023 totaled $160.1 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing time deposits will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits are not retained, the Company may utilize FHLBNY 62 advances, unsecured credit lines with correspondent banks, or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. Contractual Obligations . In the ordinary course of its operations, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. There have been no material changes in the Company’s material cash requirements under its contractual obligations as discussed in its most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Other Material Cash Requirements. In addition to contractual obligations, the Company’s material cash requirements also includes compensation and benefits expenses for its employees, which were $7.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The Company also has material cash requirements for occupancy and equipment expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization of $0.5 million, related to rental expenses, general maintenance and cleaning supplies, guard services, software licenses and other miscellaneous expenses, which were $3.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part I, Item 2 of this report under “Management of Market Risk”. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of March 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, there were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting. 63 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. The Company is not involved in any pending legal proceedings as a plaintiff or a defendant other than routine legal proceeding occurring in the ordinary course of business. At March 31, 2023, the Company was not involved in any legal proceedings the outcome of which management believes would be material to its financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A.

Nature of Business and Summa ry of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Consolidation: Ponce Financial Group, Inc., as the successor by merger with PDL Community Bancorp pursuant to the completion of the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from the mutual holding company to the stock holding company form of organization that was effective on January 27, 2022 (hereafter referred to as “we,” “our,” “us,” “Ponce Financial Group, Inc.,” or the “Company”), is the holding company of Ponce Bank (“Ponce Bank” or the “Bank”), a federally chartered stock savings association. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary Ponce Bank (the “Bank”) and the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Ponce De Leon Mortgage Corp., which is a mortgage banking entity. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Nature of Operations: The Company is a savings and loan holding company. The Company is subject to the regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Company’s business is conducted through the administrative office and 13 full service banking and 5 mortgage loan offices. The banking offices are located in New York City – the Bronx ( 4 branches), Manhattan ( 2 branches), Queens ( 4 branches), Brooklyn ( 3 branches) and Union City ( 1 branch), New Jersey. The mortgage loan offices are located in Queens ( 3 ) and Brooklyn ( 1 ), New York and Bergenfield ( 1 ), New Jersey. The Company’s primary market area currently consists of the New York City metropolitan area. The Bank is a federally chartered stock savings association headquartered in the Bronx, New York. It was originally chartered in 1960 as a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association under the name Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1985, the Bank changed its name to “Ponce De Leon Federal Savings Bank.” In 1997, the Bank changed its name again to “Ponce De Leon Federal Bank.” Upon the completion of its reorganization into a mutual holding company structure in September of 2017, the assets and liabilities of Ponce De Leon Federal Bank were transferred to and assumed by the Bank. The Bank is a Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), a Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”), and a certified Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lender. The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). The Bank’s business primarily consists of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in mortgage loans, consisting of one-to-four family residential (both investor-owned and owner-occupied), multifamily residential, nonresidential properties and construction and land, and, to a lesser extent, in business and consumer loans. The Bank also invests in securities, which have historically consisted of U.S. government and federal agency securities and securities issued by government-sponsored or owned enterprises, mortgage-backed securities and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the “FHLBNY”) stock. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts, including demand, savings, money markets and certificates of deposit accounts. On July 10, 2020 , the Company completed its acquisition of Mortgage World Bankers, Inc. (“Mortgage World”). During the year ended December 31, 2021, Mortgage World was a mortgage banking entity subject to the regulation and examination of the New York State Department of Financial Services. The primary business of Mortgage World was the taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they were sold to investors. Although Mortgage World was permitted to do business in various states (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and Connecticut), it primarily operated in the New York City metropolitan area. On January 26, 2022, Mortgage World transferred its assets and liabilities to Ponce Bank and ceased operating as an independent mortgage banking entity. Mortgage World’s business is now conducted as a division of Ponce Bank. Risks and Uncertainties: On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched significant military action against Ukraine, and sustained conflict and disruption in the region continues. The impact to Ukraine as well as actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions imposed by Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U.S. and other countries and companies and organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Russia, and actions taken by Russia in response to such sanctions, and each country’s potential response to such sanctions, tensions, and military actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 6 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic continues to disrupt the global and U.S. economies and as well as the lives of individuals throughout the world. The New York City Metropolitan area continues to experience, although to a much lesser extent, cases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the lessening of government regulations related to COVID-19, it still impacts macroeconomic conditions. The financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely impact several industries within our geographic footprint and impair the ability of the Company’s customers to fulfill their contractual obligations to the Company. This could cause the Company to experience adverse effects on its business operations, loan portfolio, financial condition, and results of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the provision for loan losses amounted to $ 11.4 million primarily due to reserves related to loans originated by Grain Technologies, LLC (""Grain"") (see Note 5 for additional information related to Grain reserves) as well as increases in the loan portfolio. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Use of Estimates : In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, the valuation of loans held for sale, the valuation of deferred tax assets and investment securities and the estimates relating to the valuation for share-based awards. Interim Financial Statements : The interim consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2022, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 are unaudited and reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 , are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2022, or any other period. Significant Group Concentrations of Credit Risk : Most of the Bank's activities are with customers located within New York City. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the Bank's loan portfolio and the ability of Mortgage World, a division of the Bank, to sell originated loans in the secondary markets are susceptible to changes in the local market conditions. Note 4 discusses the types of securities in which the Bank invests. Notes 5 and 12 discuss the types of lending that the Bank engages in, and other concentrations. Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts due from banks (including items in process of clearing). For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash flows from loans originated by the Company, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions, and deposits are reported net. Included in cash and cash equivalents are restricted cash from escrows and good faith deposits. Escrows consist of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) upfront mortgage insurance premiums and escrows on unsold mortgages that are held on behalf of borrowers. Good faith deposits consist of deposits received from commercial loan customers for use in various disbursements relating to the closing of a commercial loan. Restricted cash are included in cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows. Securities : Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the date individual investment securities are acquired, and the appropriateness of such classification is reassessed at each statement of financial condition date. Debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, if any, are classified as ""held-to-maturity"" and recorded at amortized cost. Trading securities, if any, are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings. Securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading, are classified as ""available-for-sale"" and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: 1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and 2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. The credit loss is defined as the difference between the discounted present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. For equity securities, the entire amount of impairment is recognized through earnings. 7 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific-identification method. The sale of a held-to-maturity security within three months of its maturity date or after collection of at least 85 % of the principal outstanding at the time the security was acquired is considered a maturity for purposes of classification and disclosure. Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock : The Bank is a member of the FHLBNY. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. FHLBNY stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. Loans Receivable : Loans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at current unpaid principal balances, net of the allowance for loan losses and including net deferred loan origination fees and costs. Interest income is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the interest method without anticipating prepayments. A loan is moved to nonaccrual status in accordance with the Company’s policy typically after 90 days of non-payment. The accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is generally discontinued at the time the loan becomes 90 days past due unless the loan is well-secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than 90 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All nonaccrual loans are considered impaired loans. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual are reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash basis or recorded against principal balances, until qualifying for return to accrual. Cash basis interest recognition is only applied on nonaccrual loans with a sufficient collateral margin to ensure no doubt with respect to the collectability of principal. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and remain current for a period of time (typically six months) and future payments are reasonably assured. Accrued interest receivable is closely monitored for collectability and will be charged-off in a timely manner if deemed uncollectable. Allowance for Loan Losses : The allowance for loan losses (“ALLL”) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged-off. The Company’s assessment of its loan portfolio with Grain and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and interest rates on borrowers indicates that it is likely that such conditions will be a detriment to their ability to repay in the short-term and that the likelihood of long-term detrimental effects depends significantly on the resumption of normalized economic activities, a factor not yet determinable. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. 8 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Impaired loans are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral, present value of cash flows, or the observable market price of the note. Impairment measurement for all collateral dependent loans, excluding accruing troubled debt restructurings, is based on the fair value of collateral, less costs to sell, if necessary. A loan is considered collateral dependent if repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the sale or the operation of the underlying collateral. When a loan is modified to troubled debt restructuring, management evaluates for any possible impairment using either the discounted cash flows method, where the value of the modified loan is based on the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, or by using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs, if repayment under the modified terms becomes doubtful. The general component covers non‑impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced over a rolling 12 quarter average period, except for loans originated by Grain where the Bank uses one quarter. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These economic factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and, effects of changes in credit concentrations. When establishing the allowance for loan losses, management categorizes loans into risk categories reflecting individual borrower earnings, liquidity, leverage and cash flow, as well as the nature of underlying collateral. These risk categories and relevant risk characteristics are as follows: Residential and Multifamily Mortgage Loans : Residential and multifamily mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages. These loans are typically underwritten with loan-to-value ratios ranging from 65 % to 90 %. The primary risks involved in residential mortgages are the borrower’s loss of employment, or other significant event, that negatively impacts the source of repayment. Additionally, a serious decline in home values could jeopardize repayment in the event that the underlying collateral needs to be liquidated to pay-off the loan. Nonresidential Mortgage Loans : Nonresidential mortgage loans are primarily secured by commercial buildings, office and industrial buildings, warehouses, small retail shopping centers and various special purpose properties, including hotels, restaurants and nursing homes. These loans are typically underwritten at no more than 75 % loan-to-value ratio. Although terms vary, commercial real estate loans generally have amortization periods of 15 to 30 years , as well as balloon payments of 10 to 15 years , and terms which provide that the interest rates are adjusted on a 5 -year schedule. Construction and Land Loans : Construction real estate loans consist of vacant land and property that is in the process of improvement. Repayment of these loans can be dependent on the sale of the property to third parties or the successful completion of the improvements by the builder for the end user. In the event a loan is made on property that is not yet improved for the planned development, there is the risk that government approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Construction loans also run the risk that improvements will not be completed on time or in accordance with specifications and projected costs. Construction real estate loans generally have terms of six months to two years during the construction period with fixed rates or interest rates based on a designated index. Business Loans : Business loans are loans for commercial, corporate and business purposes, including issuing letters of credit. These loans are secured by business assets or may be unsecured and repayment is directly dependent on the successful operation of the borrower’s business and the borrower’s ability to convert the assets to operating revenue. They possess greater risk than most other types of loans because the repayment capacity of the borrower may become inadequate. Business loans generally have terms of five to seven years or less and interest rates that float in accordance with a designated published index. Substantially all such loans are backed by the personal guarantees of the owners of the business. Consumer Loans : Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates than mortgage loans. The risk involved in consumer loans is the type and nature of the collateral and, in certain cases, the absence of collateral. Consumer loans include passbook loans and other secured and unsecured loans that have been made for a variety of consumer purposes. Included in consumer loans are loans originated by Grain. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value : Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, include residential mortgages that were originated in accordance with secondary market pricing and underwriting standards. These loans are loans originated by the Bank’s Mortgage World division and the Company intends to sell these loans on the secondary market. Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. The gains or losses for the changes in fair value of these loans are included in income on sale of mortgage loans on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale measured under the fair value option is calculated based on the principal amount of the loan and is included in interest loans receivable on the consolidated statements of operations . Derivative Financial Instruments : The Company, through the Bank’s Mortgage World division, uses derivative financial instruments as a part of its price risk management activities. All such derivative financial instruments are designated as free-standing derivative instruments. In accordance with FASB ASC 815-25, Derivatives and Hedging , all derivative instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their fair value. Change in the fair value of these derivatives is reported in current period earnings. 9 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Additionally, to facilitate the sale of mortgage loans, the Bank, through its Mortgage World division, may enter into forward sale positions on securities, and mandatory delivery positions. Exposure to losses or gains on these positions is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid. As of September 30, 2022 , the Company did not enter into any forward sale or mandatory delivery positions on their financial instruments. Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The Company’s revenue from contracts with customers in the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contract with Customers , is recognized within noninterest income. ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Management determined the revenue streams impacted by ASC 606 included those related to service charges on deposit accounts, ATM and card fees and other services fees. The Company’s revenue recognition pattern for these revenue streams did not change from current practice. The Company's primary sources of revenue are interest income on financial assets and income from mortgage banking activities, which are explicitly excluded from the scope of ASC 606. COVID-19 Pandemic and the CARES Act: On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law. Section 4013 of the CARES Act, “Temporary Relief from Troubled Debt Restructurings,” provides banks the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings (“TDR”) for a limited period of time to account for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, on April 7, 2020, the banking agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, issued a statement, “Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working With Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised)” (“Interagency Statement”), to encourage banks to work prudently with borrowers and to describe the agencies’ interpretation of how accounting rules under ASC 310-40, “Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors,” apply to certain of the COVID-19 pandemic related modifications. Further, on August 3, 2020, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council issued a Joint Statement on Additional Loan Accommodations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, to provide prudent risk management and consumer protection principles for financial institutions to consider while working with borrowers as loans near the end of initial loan accommodation periods. Under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, modifications of loan terms do not automatically result in TDRs and the Company generally does not need to categorize the COVID-19 pandemic-related modifications as TDRs. The Company may elect not to categorize loan modifications as TDRs if they are (1) related to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (A) 60 days after the date of termination of the National Emergency or (B) December 31, 2020. This relief was extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act enacted on December 27, 2020 to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the termination of the national emergency. This relief was not extended beyond January 1, 2022 and the Bank has made appropriate adjustments which are not material. Federal banking agencies were required to defer to the determination of the banks making such election. This includes short-term (e.g., six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. Borrowers considered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented. Financial institutions accounting for eligible loans under Section 4013 are not required to apply ASC Subtopic 310-40 to the Section 4013 loans for the term of the loan modification. Financial institutions do not have to report Section 4013 loans as TDRs in regulatory reports, including this Form 10-Q for periods prior to the expiration date. Transfers of Financial Assets : Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when all of the components meet the definition of a participating interest and when control over the assets has been surrendered. A participating interest generally represents (1) a proportionate (pro rata) ownership interest in an entire financial asset, (2) a relationship where from the date of transfer all cash flows received from the entire financial asset are divided proportionately among the participating interest holders in an amount equal to their share of ownership, (3) the priority of cash flows has certain characteristics, including no reduction in priority, subordination of interest, or recourse to the transferor other than standard representation or warranties, and (4) no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Bank, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Bank does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either (a) an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity or (b) the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a clean-up call. 10 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Premises and Equipment : Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed and charged to operations using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows: Years Buildings 39 Building improvements 15 - 39 Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 3 - 10 Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated economic lives or the related lease terms, including extensions expected to be exercised. Gains and losses on dispositions are recognized upon realization. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and improvements are capitalized. Leasehold improvements in process are not amortized until the assets are placed in operation. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets : Long-lived assets, including premises and leasehold improvements, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated by that review, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to noninterest expense. Other Real Estate Owned : Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) represents properties acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure or other proceedings. OREO is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated disposal costs, at the date of foreclosure, which establishes a new cost basis. After foreclosure, the properties are held for sale and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs of disposal. Any write-down to fair value, at the time of transfer to OREO, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Properties are evaluated regularly to ensure that the recorded amounts are supported by current fair values and charges against earnings are recorded as necessary to reduce the carrying amount to fair value, less estimated costs to dispose. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property are capitalized, subject to the limit of fair value of the OREO, while costs relating to holding the property are expensed. Gains or losses are included in operations upon disposal. Income Taxes : The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income, in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 % likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, would be classified as additional provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. Related Party Transactions : Directors and officers of the Company and their affiliates have been customers of and have had transactions with the Company, and it is expected that such persons will continue to have such transactions in the future. Management believes that all deposit accounts, loans, services and commitments comprising such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other customers who are not directors or officers. In the opinion of management, the transactions with related parties did not involve more than normal risk of collectability, nor favored treatment or terms, nor present other unfavorable features. Note 16 contains details regarding related party transactions. 11 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Employee Benefit Plans: The Company maintains a KSOP, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) provisions incorporated, a Long-Term Incentive Plan that includes grants of restricted stock units and stock options, and a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”). KSOP, the Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions: Compensation expense is recorded as shares are committed to be released with a corresponding credit to unearned KSOP equity account at the average fair market value of the shares during the period and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the service period based upon management’s estimate of the number of shares expected to be allocated by the KSOP. The difference between the average fair market value and the cost of the shares allocated by the KSOP is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in-capital. Unallocated common shares held by the Company’s KSOP are shown as a reduction in stockholders’ equity and are excluded from weighted-average common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted earnings per share calculations until they are committed to be released. The 401(k) provisions provide for elective employee/participant deferrals of income. Discretionary matching, profit-sharing, and safe harbor contributions, not to exceed 4 % of employee compensation and profit-sharing contributions may be provided. Stock Options: The Company recognizes the value of shared-based payment transactions as compensation costs in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. The fair value of the share-based payments for stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur during the period. Restricted Stock Units: The Company recognizes compensation cost related to restricted stock units based on the market price of the stock units at the grant date over the vesting period. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determines the fair value of restricted stock units. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Comprehensive (Loss) Income: Comprehensive (loss) income consists of net (loss) income and other comprehensive (loss) income, which are both recognized as separate components of stockholder’s equity. Other comprehensive (loss) income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale. Loss Contingencies : Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are any such matters that will have a material effect on the operations and financial position of the Company. Fair Value of Financial Instruments : Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in Note 13. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates. Segment Reporting : The Company has two reportable segments: the Bank and, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, Mortgage World, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 , Mortgage World as a division of the Bank. Income from the Bank consists primarily of interest and fees earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts. Income from Mortgage World consists primarily of taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they are sold to investors. Loan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments : Financial instruments include off‑balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. Earnings (Loss) per Share (“EPS”) : Basic EPS represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding, plus the effect of potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Basic weighted common shares outstanding is weighted average common shares outstanding less weighted average unallocated ESOP shares. Treasury Stock : Shares repurchased under the Company’s share repurchase programs were purchased in open-market transactions and are held as treasury stock. The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of stockholders’ equity. Reclassification of Prior Periods Presentation : Certain prior periods amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reporting results of operations and did not affect previously reported amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations 12 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements: As an emerging growth company (“EGC”) as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, the Company has elected to use the extended transition period to delay the adoption of new or reissued accounting pronouncements applicable to public business entities until such pronouncements are made applicable to nonpublic business entities. The Company will be exiting the EGC status as of December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2022, there is no significant difference in the comparability of the consolidated financial statements as a result of this extended transition period. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” This ASU requires all lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset, measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, at the lease commencement date. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged under the new guidance. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, for public business entities. As the Company is taking advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards assuming it remains an EGC, it will adopt the amendments in this update for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company has evaluated the amended guidance including the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. To date, the Company has identified its leased office spaces as within the scope of the guidance. The Company currently leases its administrative office and 17 branches and mortgage offices and the new guidance will result in the establishment of a right to use asset and corresponding lease obligations. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance, including determining whether other contracts exist that are deemed to be in scope and subsequent related accounting standard updates. The Company has established a project committee and has initiated training on ASU 2016-02. The Company is performing preliminary computations of its right to use asset and corresponding lease obligations for the operating leases of its administrative office and 17 leased branches and mortgage offices. The Company is utilizing a new lease accounting tool to assist in the computations of its right to use asset and corresponding lease obligations for the operating leases. The Company will adopt this standard at the end of December 2022 and anticipates recognizing approximately $ 35.0 million of a right of use asset and an operating lease liability. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “ Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This ASU significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The standard is to replace today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model. The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model, is to apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments and financial guarantees. The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities. For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. As a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time, as they do today. The ASU also reportedly simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt, securities and loans. ASU 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity’s assumptions, models and methods for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, entities will need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, for public business entities, that are not deemed to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC as of November 15, 2019. As the Company has taking advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards assuming it remains an EGC, it will adopt the amendments in this update for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities have to apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach). The Company has evaluated the amended guidance including the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. As a result of the required change in approach toward determining estimated credit losses from the current “incurred loss” model to one based on estimated cash flows over a loan’s contractual life, adjusted for prepayments (a “life of loan” model), the Company expects that the new guidance might result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses, particularly for longer duration loan portfolios. The Company also notes that the new guidance may result in an allowance for available-for-sale debt securities. The Company has selected the CECL model and assembled a project team. The project team meets on a regular basis to determine the approach for implementation. This includes assessing the adequacy of existing loan and loss data, assessing models for default and loss estimates, conducting limited trial runs and analytical review through December 31, 2022, and to complete independent model valuation and documentation of processes and controls in the first quarter of 2023. 13 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) . ” This ASU provides optional means and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or other reference rates expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company believes this update will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2. Preferred Stock Issuance; Plan of Conversion and Stock Offering Preferred Stock Issuance On June 7, 2022, the Company‎ closed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 225,000 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A‎, par value $ 0.01 (the “Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price equal to $ 225.0 million in cash, to the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) pursuant to the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”).‎ The holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a dividend payable in cash quarterly at an annual rate dependent on certain factors as reported by the Company to Treasury in a quarterly supplemental report. The initial dividend rate is zero percent for the first two years after issuance, and thereafter the floor dividend rate is 0.50 % and the ceiling dividend rate is 2.00 %. After 10 years of issuance, the perpetual dividend rate in effect, will be determined based on said floor and ceiling. The actual dividend rate that will be paid by the Company on the Preferred Stock cannot be determined at this time. The ECIP investment by the Treasury is part of a program to invest over $ 8.7 billion into Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) or ‎Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), of which Ponce Bank is both. The ECIP is intended to incentivize CDFIs and MDIs to provide loans, grants, ‎and forbearance to small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers in low-income and underserved communities that may have been ‎disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.‎ In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $ 1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. Plan of Conversion and Common Stock Offering On May 25, 2021, Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company and PDL Community Bancorp, the then holding company for Ponce Bank and Mortgage World Bankers, Inc., announced that their Boards of Directors had unanimously adopted a Plan of Conversion and Reorganization (the “Plan”) pursuant to which Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company and PDL Community Bancorp reorganized into a new stock holding company and conducted a second-step stock offering of new shares of common stock. On January 26, 2022, Mortgage World transferred its assets and liabilities to Ponce Bank and ceased operating as an independent mortgage banking entity. Mortgage World’s business is now conducted as a division of Ponce Bank. On January 27, 2022, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and PDL Community Bancorp announced that the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from the mutual to stock form of organization and related stock offering was consummated at the close of business. As a result of the closing of the conversion and reorganization and stock offering, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. is now the holding company for Ponce Bank. Ponce Bank’s former mutual holding companies, PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, have ceased to exist. PDL Community Bancorp’s stock ceased trading at the close of the market on January 27, 2022. Ponce Financial Group, Inc.’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the same trading symbol “PDLB” on January 28, 2022. As a result of the conversion and reorganization, each issued and outstanding share of PDL Community Bancorp common stock was converted into the right to receive 1.3952 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. Cash was paid in lieu of any fractional shares based on the sale price in the offering of $ 10.00 per share. Ponce Financial Group Inc.’s total issued and outstanding shares on January 28, 2022 was 24,711,834 shares. All shares of treasury stock of PDL Community Bancorp were eliminated on January 27, 2022. At December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents included $ 122.0 million received in connection with the conversion and reorganization and was reflected as a separate liability on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. As of January 27, 2022, these funds were reclassified as proceeds from the sale of the Company’s common stock. 14 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) On January 27, 2022, the Company made a $ 5.0 million in contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation as part of the conversion and reorganization, which is included in the non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Note 3. Restrictions on Cash and Due from Banks The Bank was previously required to maintain reserve balances in cash or on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank, based on a percentage of deposits. Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board eliminated reserve requirement for depository institutions to support lending to households and businesses. Note 4.

Management reviewed the financial condition of the entities underlying the securities at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The unrealized losses related to the Company debt securities were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies. The Company does not believe that the debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2022 represents a credit loss impairment. The gross unrealized loss positions related to mortgage-backed securities and other obligations issued by the U.S government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. Total gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities. 17 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Management reviewed the collectability of the corporate bonds taking into consideration of such factors as the financial condition of the issuers, reported regulatory capital ratios of the issuers, credit ratings, including ratings in effect as of the reporting date. Management believes the unrealized losses on the corporate bonds are primarily attributable to changes in the interest rates and not changes in the credit quality of the issuers of the corporate bonds. The following is a summary of maturities of securities at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Amounts are shown by contractual maturity. Because borrowers for mortgage-backed securities have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties, at any time, these securities are included as a total within the table.

The Company primarily grants loans secured by real estate to individuals and businesses pursuant to an established credit policy applicable to each type of lending activity in which it engages. Although collateral provides assurance as a secondary source of repayment, the Company ordinarily requires the primary source of repayment to be based on the borrowers’ ability to generate continuing cash flows. The Company also evaluates the collateral and creditworthiness of each customer. The credit policy provides that depending on the borrowers’ creditworthiness and type of collateral, credit may be extended up to predetermined percentages of the market value of the collateral or on an unsecured basis. Real estate is the primary form of collateral. Other important forms of collateral are time deposits and marketable securities. For disclosures related to the allowance for loan losses and credit quality, the Company does not have any disaggregated classes of loans below the segment level. Credit-Quality Indicators : Internally assigned risk ratings are used as credit-quality indicators, which are reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. The objectives of the Company’s risk-rating system are to provide the Board of Directors and senior management with an objective assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio, to promptly and accurately identify loans with well-defined credit weaknesses so that timely action can be taken to minimize credit loss, to identify relevant trends affecting the collectability of the loan portfolio, to isolate potential problem areas and to provide essential information for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Below are the definitions of the internally assigned risk ratings: 20 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Loans within the top four categories above are considered pass rated, as commonly defined. Risk ratings are assigned as necessary to differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised to reflect changes in the borrowers’ financial condition and outlook, debt service coverage capability, repayment performance, collateral value and coverage as well as other considerations.

Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Loans are considered impaired when current information and events indicate all amounts due may not be collectable according to the contractual terms of the related loan agreements. Impaired loans, including troubled debt restructurings, are identified by applying normal loan review procedures in accordance with the allowance for loan losses methodology. Management periodically assesses loans to determine whether impairment exists. Any loan that is, or will potentially be, no longer performing in accordance with the terms of the original loan contract is evaluated to determine impairment. The following information relates to impaired loans as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021: Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized As of and For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on a Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential $ 13,100 $ 11,015 $ 1,777 $ 12,792 $ 168 $ 11,440 $ 164 Multifamily residential — — — — — 789 — Nonresidential properties 1,630 1,239 348 1,587 37 2,268 38 Construction and land 10,660 10,660 — 10,660 — 5,147 16 Nonmortgage loans: Business 359 359 — 359 — 93 — Consumer — — — — 24 — Total $ 25,749 $ 23,273 $ 2,125 $ 25,398 $ 205 $ 19,761 $ 218 Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized As of and For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on a Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential $ 11,107 $ 8,701 $ 2,014 $ 10,715 $ 214 $ 12,166 $ 189 Multifamily residential 2,555 2,577 — 2,577 — 939 — Nonresidential properties 2,716 1,866 362 2,228 39 4,404 38 Construction and land 922 922 — 922 — 154 — Nonmortgage loans: Business — — — — — — — Consumer — — — — — 24 — Total $ 17,300 $ 14,066 $ 2,376 $ 16,442 $ 253 $ 17,687 $ 227 Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized As of and for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on a Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential $ 13,333 $ 10,535 $ 1,991 $ 12,526 $ 205 $ 12,145 $ 189 Multifamily residential 1,200 1,200 — 1,200 — 1,139 63 Nonresidential properties 3,494 2,637 358 2,995 38 3,941 38 Construction and land 917 917 — 917 — 307 17 Nonmortgage loans: Business 13 13 — 13 — 13 — Consumer — — — — — 24 — Total $ 18,957 $ 15,302 $ 2,349 $ 17,651 $ 243 $ 17,569 $ 307 24 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The loan portfolio also includes certain loans that have been modified to troubled debt restructurings. Under applicable standards, loans are modified to troubled debt restructurings when a creditor, for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor’s financial condition, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider, unless it results in a delay in payment that is insignificant. These concessions could include a reduction of interest rate on the loan, payment and maturity extensions, forbearance, or other actions intended to maximize collections. When a loan is modified to a troubled debt restructuring, management evaluates for any possible impairment using either the discounted cash flows method, where the value of the modified loan is based on the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, or by using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs if repayment under the modified terms becomes doubtful. If management determines that the value of the modified loan in a troubled debt restructuring is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized through a specific allowance estimate or charge-off against the allowance for loan losses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 , and for the year ended December 31, 2021, there were no loans restructured as a troubled debt restructuring. At September 30, 2022 , there were 23 troubled debt restructured loans totaling $ 6.7 million of which $ 4.2 million are on accrual status. At December 31, 2021, there were 30 troubled debt restructured loans totaling $ 8.7 million of which $ 6.2 million are on accrual status. There were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. The financial impact from the concessions made represents specific impairment reserves on these loans, which aggregated to $ 205,000 and $ 243,000 at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale at Fair Value At September 30, 2022 and at December 31, 2021 , 8 loans and 27 loans related to Mortgage World in the amount of $ 3.4 million and $ 15.5 million, respectively, were held for sale and accounted for under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. Write-off and write-down of Microloans In 2020, the Company entered into a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain. Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to $ 1,000 and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originates and services these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan is found to be fraudulent, becomes 90 days delinquent upon 90 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.” The Bank, pursuant to its agreement with Grain, at December 31, 2021, had 59,180 microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with credit extensions aggregating $ 33.9 million. Of these microloans, the Bank estimates that 80 percent have been made in low- and low-to-moderate income census tracts with an estimated 56 percent made to minority borrowers. At September 30, 2022, the Bank had 47,470 Grain microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $ 21.5 million and which were performing, in management’s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by an $ 8.2 million allowance for loan losses, resulting in $ 13.3 million in Grain microloans, net of allowance for loan losses. Since the beginning of the Bank’s agreement with Grain and through September 30, 2022, 45,322 microloans amounting to $ 25.5 million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain. The Company has written-down a total of $ 17.5 million of the Grain Receivable for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and received $ 6.2 million in cash from Grain and through the application of security deposits connected to fraudulent loan accounts. The Bank also opted to use the $ 1.8 million grant it received from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Rapid Response ‎Program to defray the Grain Receivable. The application of those amounts resulted in no net receivable. Additionally, the Company has written-off its equity investment in Grain of $ 1.0 million. As of September 30, 2022, the Company’s total exposure to Grain was $ 13.3 million of the remaining microloans, net of allowance for loan losses and a $ 15.3 million of unused commitments available to Grain borrowers. The $ 7.9 million and $ 17.5 million write-off and write-down for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, is included in non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 25 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Grain Technologies, Inc.

As of December 31, 2021, Mortgage World was in full compliance with all financial covenants. Warehouse Line of Credit #1 The interest rate is based on the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 3.25 %. The effective rate as of December 31, 2021 was 3.35 %. The line of credit is an evergreen agreement that terminates upon request by either the financial institution or the borrower. Warehouse Line of Credit #2 The interest rate is based on the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 3.00 % for loans funded. The effective rate as of December 31, 2021 was 3.10 %. This warehouse line of credit was terminated on March 31, 2022 . There was no interest expense on warehouse lines of credit for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Total interest expense on warehouse lines of credit totaled $ 72,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2021, and $ 70,000 and $ 284,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. December 31, 2021 Credit Line Unused Line Maximum of Credit Balance (in thousands) Warehouse Line of Credit #1 $ 15,000 $ 8,636 $ 6,364 Warehouse Line of Credit #2 15,000 $ 6,274 $ 8,726 Total long-term debt $ 30,000 $ 14,910 $ 15,090 Mortgage Loan Funding Payable: Mortgage loan funding payable consists of liabilities to borrowers in connection with the origination of residential loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market, that remain unfunded by the Company because there is typically a three day period from when the loans close to when they are funded by the warehouse line of credit. This liability is presented at cost and fully offsets the principal balance of the related loans included in mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value on the consolidated 28 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) statement of financial condition. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , there were no mortgage loan funding payable for both periods. Note 9. Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 consists of the following: For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (in thousands) Federal: Current $ 2,265 $ 322 $ 370 $ 3,378 Deferred ( 2,750 ) 455 ( 4,047 ) ( 478 ) ( 485 ) 777 ( 3,677 ) 2,900 State and local: Current 274 179 847 570 Deferred ( 2,963 ) ( 1,275 ) ( 5,487 ) ( 574 ) ( 2,689 ) ( 1,096 ) ( 4,640 ) ( 4 ) Valuation allowance 2,354 1,637 4,061 1,068 (Benefit) provision for income taxes $ ( 820 ) $ 1,318 $ ( 4,256 ) $ 3,964 29 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Total income tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21 % for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to income before income taxes as a result of the following: For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (in thousands) Income tax, at federal rate $ ( 3,267 ) $ 708 $ ( 5,259 ) $ 3,024 State and local tax, net of federal taxes ( 2,125 ) ( 1,501 ) ( 3,666 ) ( 638 ) Valuation allowance, net of the federal benefit 2,354 1,637 4,061 1,068 Other 2,218 474 608 510 $ ( 820 ) $ 1,318 $ ( 4,256 ) $ 3,964 Management maintains a valuation allowance against its net New York State and New York City deferred tax assets as it is unlikely these deferred tax assets will be utilized to reduce the Company's tax liability in future years. The valuation allowance increased by $ 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and $ 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Management has determined that it is not required to establish a valuation allowance against any other deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully utilized in future periods. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers the scheduled reversal of the deferred tax liabilities, the level of historical taxable income, and the projected future taxable income over the periods that the temporary differences comprising the deferred tax assets will be deductible. For federal income tax purposes, a financial institution may carry net operating losses (“NOLs”) to forward tax years indefinitely. The use of NOLs to offset income is limited to 80 %. The CARES Act allows NOLs generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding tax years. The Company did not generate NOLs in 2018, 2019 or 2020 so no carryback is available. At September 30, 2022 , the Bank had a federal NOLs carryforward of $ 9.9 million. The state and city of New York allow for a three-year carryback period and carryforward period of twenty years on NOLs generated on or after tax year 2015. For tax years prior to 2015, no carryback period is allowed. Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, has pre-2015 carryforwards of $ 572,000 for New York State purposes and $ 528,000 for New York City purposes. Furthermore, there are post-2015 carryforwards available of $ 55.0 million for New York State purposes and $ 30.9 million for New York City purposes. Finally, for New Jersey purposes, losses may only be carried forward 20 years, with no allowable carryback period. At September 30, 2022 , the Bank had a New Jersey NOLs carryforward of $ 354,000 . At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits recorded. The Company does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase in the next twelve months. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax, New York State income tax, Connecticut income tax, New Jersey income tax, Florida income tax, Pennsylvania income tax and New York City income tax. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2018. 30 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are presented below: September 30, December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan losses $ 8,219 $ 5,254 Deferred loan fees — 214 Interest on nonaccrual loans 165 102 Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities 4,928 399 Amortization of intangible assets 37 50 Deferred rent payable 240 152 Net operating losses 7,837 3,280 Charitable contribution carryforward 1,748 366 Compensation and benefits 1,135 456 Other 1,063 264 Total gross deferred tax assets 25,372 10,537 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation of premises and equipment 1,323 1,301 Deferred loan fees 749 — Other 64 63 Total gross deferred tax liabilities 2,136 1,364 Valuation allowance 9,414 5,353 Net deferred tax assets $ 13,822 $ 3,820 Note 10. Compensation and Benefit Plans Ponce Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions (the “KSOP”) . Effective January 1, 2021, Ponce Bank amended and restated the terms of the Ponce Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “ESOP”) and merged the Ponce Bank 401(k) Plan into the ESOP to form the KSOP. There were no changes to the provisions of the ESOP as discussed below. The KSOP is for eligible employees of Ponce Bank and those of its affiliates. The named executive officers are eligible to participate in the KSOP just like other employees. An employee must attain the age of 21 and will be eligible to participate in the 401(k) features of the KSOP in the quarter following thirty days of service and the ESOP feature of the KSOP upon the first entry date commencing on or after the eligible employee’s completion of one year of service. Employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan at the beginning of each quarter (January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1). 401(k) Component : Under the 401(k) features of the KSOP (“401(k) Component”), a participant may elect to defer, on a pre-tax basis, the maximum amount as permitted by the Internal Revenue Code. For 2022, the salary deferral contribution limit was $ 20,500 ; provided, however, that a participant over age 50 may contribute an additional $ 6,500 to the 401(k) for a total of $ 27,000 . In addition to salary deferral contributions, Ponce Bank may make discretionary matching contributions, discretionary profit sharing contributions or safe harbor contributions to the 401(k) Component. Discretionary matching contributions are allocated on the basis of salary deferral contributions. Discretionary profit sharing contributions are based on three classifications set forth in the 401(k) feature (i) Class A — Chairman, President, and Executive Vice Presidents; (ii) Class B — Senior Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents and Assistant Vice Presidents; and (iii) Class C — all other eligible employees. The contribution for a class will be the same percentage of compensation for all participants in that class. If Ponce Bank decides to make a safe harbor contribution for a plan year, each participant will receive a contribution equal to 3 % of his or her compensation for the plan year. The 401(k) expenses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations amounted to $ 64,000 and $ 96,000 for both the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 and $ 256,000 and $ 279,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. 31 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) A participant is always 100 % vested in his or her salary deferral contributions and safe harbor contributions. Discretionary matching and profit sharing contributions are 20 % vested after two years of service, plus an additional 20 % for each additional year of service; so all participants are fully vested in such contributions after six years of service. Participants also will become fully vested in his or her account balance in the 401(k) Component automatically upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the KSOP. Generally, participants will receive distributions from the KSOP upon separation from service in accordance with the terms of the governing document. ESOP Component: On September 29, 2017, in connection with the Bank’s reorganization into the mutual holding company form of organization, the ESOP trustee purchased, on behalf of the ESOP, 723,751 shares of PDL Community Bancorp common stock. The ESOP funded its stock purchase with a loan (“First ESOP loan”) from PDL Community Bancorp in the amount of $ 7.2 million, which was equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The First ESOP loan is being repaid principally through Ponce Bank’s contributions to the ESOP over the 15 -year term of such loan. The interest rate for the First ESOP loan is 2.60 %. On January 27, 2022, concurrent with the completion of the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from a mutual form to a stock form of organization and the merger of PDL Community Bancorp with and into Ponce Financial Group, Inc., the shares of PDL Community Bancorp common stock held by the KSOP were converted into 977,880 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. On January 27, 2022, the KSOP trustee purchased, on behalf of the ESOP feature of the KSOP (“ESOP Component”), an additional 1,097,353 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock, or 4.44 % of the total number of shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock outstanding on January 27, 2022 (including shares issued to the Foundation). The KSOP funded this stock purchase with a loan (“Second ESOP loan”) from Ponce Financial Group, Inc. in the amount of $ 11.0 million, which was equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The Second ESOP loan is being repaid principally through Ponce Bank’s contributions to the ESOP Component over the 15 -year term of such loan. The interest rate for the Second ESOP loan is 1.822 %. The trustee of the trust funding the KSOP holds the shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock purchased by the KSOP in an unallocated suspense account, and shares will be released from the suspense account on a pro-rata basis as the loans are repaid. The trustee will allocate the shares released among participants on the basis of each participant’s proportional share of qualifying compensation relative to all participants participating in the ESOP Component. A participant will become 100 % vested in his or her account balance in the ESOP Component after three years of service. In addition, participants will become fully vested in his or her account balance in the ESOP Component automatically upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the KSOP. Generally, participants will receive distributions from the KSOP upon separation from service in accordance with the terms of the plan document. The KSOP reallocates any unvested shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock forfeited upon termination of employment among the remaining participants in the ESOP Component. Contributions to the ESOP are to be sufficient to pay principal and interest currently due under the loan agreement. Under applicable accounting requirements, Ponce Bank will record a compensation expense for the ESOP at the average market price of the shares as they are committed to be released from the unallocated suspense account to participants’ accounts, which may be more or less than the original issue price. The compensation expense resulting from the release of the common stock from the suspense account and allocation to plan participants will result in a corresponding reduction in the earnings of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. The ESOP shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations (see Note 11). As of September 30, 2022 , the combined outstanding balance of both the First ESOP loan and Second ESOP loan was $ 14.4 million. A summary of the ESOP shares as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows: September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Shares committed-to-be released 105,357 96,500 Shares allocated to participants 363,261 170,145 Unallocated shares 1,597,863 434,251 Total 2,066,481 700,896 Fair value of unallocated shares $ 14,636 $ 6,297 The Company recognized ESOP related compensation expense, including ESOP equalization expense, of $ 330,000 and $ 182,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , and $ 1.0 million and $ 513,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 32 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan: The Bank maintains a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) for the benefit of two key executive officers. The SERP expense recognized was $ 15,000 for both the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 and was $ 45,000 for both the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. 2018 Incentive Plan The Company’s stockholders approved the PDL Community Bancorp 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2018 Incentive Plan”) at the Special Meeting of Stockholders on October 30, 2018. The maximum number of shares of common stock which can be issued under the 2018 Incentive Plan is 1,248,469 . Of the 1,248,469 shares, the maximum number of shares that may be awarded under the 2018 Incentive Plan pursuant to the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) is 891,764 shares (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options), and the number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units is 356,705 shares. However, the 2018 Incentive Plan contains a flex feature that provides that awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units in excess of the 356,705 share limitation may be granted but each share of stock covered by such excess award shall reduce the 891,764 share limitation for awards of stock options and SARs by 3.0 shares of common stock. The Company converted 462,522 awards of stock options into 154,174 restricted stock units in 2018, 45,000 awards of stock options into 15,000 restricted stock units in 2020 and 191,145 awards of stock options into 63,715 restricted stock units in 2022. Under the 2018 Incentive Plan, the Company made grants equal to 674,645 shares on December 4, 2018 which include 119,176 incentive options to executive officers, 44,590 non-qualified options to outside directors, 322,254 restricted stock units to executive officers, 40,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers and 148,625 restricted stock units to outside directors. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company awarded 40,000 incentive options and 15,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers under the 2018 Incentive Plan. Awards to directors generally vest 20 % annually beginning with the first anniversary of the date of grant. Awards to a director with fewer than five years of service at the time of grant vest over a longer period and will not become fully vested until the director has completed ten years of service. Awards to the executive officer who is not a director vest 20 % annually beginning on December 4, 2020. On April 1, 2022, the Company awarded 23,718 incentive options to an executive officer, 30,659 incentive options to non-executive officers and 13,952 non-qualified options to an outside director. In addition, on April 1, 2022 the Company awarded 40,460 restricted stock units to executive officers and 23,255 restricted stock units to outside directors. As of December 31, 2021 , the maximum number of stock options and SARs remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was 189,476 . As of September 30, 2022 , the maximum number of stock options and SARs remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was 4,883 , after the conversion from PDL Community Bancorp common stock to Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock or restricted stock units remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was none , for both periods. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determine the fair value of restricted stock units under the Company’s 2018 Incentive Plan. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. 33 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) A summary of the Company’s restricted stock unit awards activity and related information for nine months ended September 30, 2022 and year ended December 31, 2021 are as follows: September 30, 2022 Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested, beginning of year 237,687 $ 12.65 Conversion and reorganization 93,933 — Granted — — Vested ( 12,440 ) 9.27 Forfeited — — Non-vested at March 31 319,180 $ 9.06 Granted 63,715 10.44 Vested — — Forfeited — — Non-vested at June 30 382,895 $ 9.29 Granted — — Vested ( 4,186 ) 7.20 Forfeited — — Non-vested at September 30 378,709 $ 9.31 December 31, 2021 Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested, beginning of year (1) 335,919 $ 12.66 Granted — — Vested ( 98,232 ) 12.69 Forfeited — — Non-vested at December 31 237,687 $ 12.65 Compensation expense related to restricted stock units was $ 360,000 and $ 318,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 and was $ 1.0 million and $ 955,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. As of September 30, 2022 , the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units was $ 2.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next 21 quarters. 34 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) A summary of the Company’s stock option awards activity and related information for nine months ended September 30, 2022 and year ended December 31, 2021 are as follows: September 30, 2022 Options Weighted- Average Exercise Price Per Share Outstanding, beginning of year 203,766 $ 12.02 Conversion and reorganization 80,526 — Granted — — Exercised — — Forfeited — — Outstanding at March 31 284,292 8.62 Granted 68,329 10.44 Exercised — — Forfeited — — Outstanding at June 30 352,621 8.97 Granted — — Exercised — — Forfeited — — Outstanding at September 30 (1) 352,621 $ 8.97 Exercisable at September 30 (1) 147,301 $ 8.74 December 31, 2021 Options Weighted- Average Exercise Price Per Share Outstanding, beginning of year 203,766 $ 12.02 Granted — — Exercised — — Forfeited — — Outstanding at December 31 (1) 203,766 $ 12.02 Exercisable at December 31 (1) 94,904 $ 12.45 The weighted-average exercise price for the options as of September 30, 2022 was $ 8.97 per share and the weighted average remaining contractual life is 6.9 years. The weighted average period over which compensation expenses are expected to be recognized is 3.8 years. There were 147,301 shares and 94,904 shares exercisable as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , respectively. Total compensation cost related to stock options recognized was $ 45,000 and $ 33,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively and $ 124,000 and $ 99,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 , the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options was $ 493,000 , which is expected to be recognized over the next 21 quarters. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Dividend yield 0.00 % 0.00 % Expected life 6.5 years 6.5 years Expected volatility 41.34 % 38.51 % Risk-free interest rate 2.65 % 0.48 % Weighted average grant date fair value $ 3.85 $ 3.77 35 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The expected volatility is based on the Company’s historical volatility. The expected life is an estimate based on management’s review of the various factors and calculated using the simplified method for plain vanilla options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s history and expectation of dividend payouts. Treasury Stock : As a result of the conversion and reorganization, all shares of treasury stock of PDL Community Bancorp were retired on January 27, 2022. Note 11. Earnings Per Share The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (Dollars in thousands except share data) Net (loss) income $ ( 14,738 ) $ 2,052 $ ( 20,787 ) $ 10,436 Common shares outstanding for basic EPS: Weighted average common shares outstanding 24,727,459 17,330,225 24,072,543 17,222,464 Less: Weighted average unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) shares 1,632,600 506,494 1,548,066 518,467 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 23,094,859 16,823,731 22,524,477 16,703,997 Basic (loss) earnings per common share $ ( 0.64 ) $ 0.12 $ ( 0.92 ) $ 0.62 Potential dilutive common shares: Add: Dilutive effect of restricted stock awards and stock options 91,102 — 42,557 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 23,094,859 16,914,833 22,524,477 16,746,554 Diluted (loss) earnings per common share $ ( 0.64 ) $ 0.12 $ ( 0.92 ) $ 0.62 Note 12. Commitments, Contingencies and Credit Risk Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk : In the normal course of business, financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk may be used to meet the financing needs of customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement in particular classes of financial instruments. The contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit represent the amounts of potential accounting loss should the contract be fully drawn upon, the customer default, and the value of any existing collateral become worthless. The same credit policies are used in making commitments and contractual obligations as for on-balance-sheet instruments. Financial instruments whose contractual amounts represent credit risk at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows: September 30, December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Commitments to grant mortgage loans $ 236,627 $ 127,159 Commitments to sell loans at lock-in rates 13,560 13,321 Unfunded commitments under lines of credit 90,615 80,033 $ 340,802 $ 220,513 36 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Commitments to Grant Mortgage Loans : Commitments to grant mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as all terms and conditions are met as established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties. Material losses are not anticipated as a result of these transactions. Commitments to Sell Loans at Lock-in Rates: In order to assure itself of a marketplace to sell its loans, Mortgage World has agreements with investors who will commit to purchase loans at locked-in rates. Mortgage World has off-balance sheet market risk to the extent that Mortgage World does not obtain matching commitments from these investors to purchase the loans. This will expose Mortgage World to the lower of cost or market valuation environment. Repurchases, Indemnifications and Premium Recaptures : Loans sold by Mortgage World under investor programs are subject to repurchase or indemnification if they fail to meet the origination criteria of those programs. In addition, loans sold to investors are also subject to repurchase or indemnifications if the loan is two or three months delinquent during a set period which usually varies from six months to a year after the loan is sold. There are no open repurchase or indemnification requests for loans sold as a correspondent lender or where the Company acted as a broker in the transaction as of September 30, 2022. Unfunded Commitments Under Lines of Credit : Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extension of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit are uncollateralized and usually contain a specified maturity date and, ultimately, may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed. Letters of Credit : Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Letters of credit are largely cash secured. Concentration by Geographic Location : Loans, commitments to extend credit and letters of credit have been granted to customers who are located primarily in the New York City metropolitan area. Generally, such loans most often are secured by one-to-four family residential properties. The loans are expected to be repaid from the borrowers' cash flows. Loan Concentrations : As of September 30, 2022, approximately 62.4 % of Mortgage World’s, a division of the Bank, total originated loan volume was insured and approximately 95.2 % of total originated loan volume was sold to three investors. The Bank’s Mortgage World division has closed approximately 99.4 % of its loan volume in two states, New York and New Jersey. Lease Commitments : At September 30, 2022 , there are noncancelable operating leases for office space that expire on various dates through 2038 . Certain of these leases contains escalation clauses providing for increased rental based on pre-scheduled annual increases or on increases in real estate taxes. On February 11, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 3821 Bergenline Avenue, Union City, New Jersey for a sale price of $ 2.4 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $ 145,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.5 %. Under the lease agreement, the Bank has four (4) consecutive options to extend the term of the lease by five (5) years for each such option. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $ 623,000 , net of expenses, which is included in non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. On June 4, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 5560 Broadway, Bronx, New York for a sale price of $ 5.7 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $ 281,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.75 %. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $ 4.2 million, net of expenses, which is included in non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 37 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Rental expenses under operating leases, included in occupancy expense, t otaled $ 1.1 million a nd $ 495,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, and $ 3.2 mil lion and $ 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Management believes that resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Note 13. Fair Value The following fair value hierarchy is used based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2 – Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: Cash and Cash Equivalents, Placements with Banks, Accrued Interest Receivable, Advance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance, and Accrued Interest Payable : The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. These assets and liabilities are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Available-for-Sale Securities : These financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models (e.g., matrix pricing) or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Examples of such instruments include government agency bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Level 3 securities are securities for which significant unobservable inputs are utilized. There were no changes in valuation techniques used to measure similar assets during the period. FHLBNY Stock : The carrying value of FHLBNY stock approximates fair value since the Bank can redeem such stock with FHLBNY at cost. As a member of the FHLBNY, the Company is required to purchase this stock, which is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. Loans Receivable : For variable rate loans, which reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, carrying values are a reasonable estimate of fair values, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using estimated market rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. Impaired loans are valued using a present value discounted cash flow method, or the fair value of the collateral. Loans are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale : Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, consists of mortgage loans originated for sale by Mortgage World and accounted for under the fair value option. These assets are valued using stated investor pricing for substantially equivalent loans as Level 2. In determining fair value, such measurements are derived based on observable market data, including whole-loan transaction pricing and similar market transactions adjusted for portfolio composition, servicing value and market conditions. Loans held for sale by the Bank are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by investor bid prices. 38 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Under the fair value option, management has elected, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, fair value for substantially all forms of mortgage loans originated for sale on a recurring basis. The fair value carrying amount of mortgages held for sale measured under the fair value option was $ 3.4 million and the aggregate unpaid principal amounted to $ 3.4 million. Interest Rate Lock Commitments : The Bank, through its Mortgage World division, enters into rate lock commitments to extend credit to borrowers for generally up to a 60 day period for origination and/or purchase of loans. To the extent that a loan is ultimately granted and the borrower ultimately accepts the terms of the loan, these loan commitments expose the Bank’s Mortgage World division to variability in its fair value due to changes in interest rates. The FASB determined that loan commitments related to the origination or acquisition of mortgage loans that will be held for sale must be accounted for as derivative instruments. Such commitments, along with any related fees received from potential borrowers, are recorded at fair value in derivative assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in income on sale of mortgage loans. Fair value is based on active market pricing for substantially similar underlying mortgage loans commonly referred to as best execution pricing or investment commitment pricing, if the loan is committed to an investor through a best efforts contract. In valuing interest rate lock commitments, there are several unobservable inputs such as the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights, estimated remaining cost to originate the loans, and the pull through rate of the open pipeline. Accordingly, such derivative is classified as Level 3. The approximate notional amounts of Mortgage World’s derivative instruments were $ 13.6 million and $ 13.3 million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fair value of derivatives related to interest rate lock commitments not subject to a forward loan sale commitment, amounted to $ 229,000 and $ 172,000 as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and is included in other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The table below presents the changes in derivatives from interest rate lock commitments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: (in thousands) Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 172 Change in fair value of derivative instrument reported in earnings ( 20 ) Balance as of March 31, 2022 152 Change in fair value of derivative instrument reported in earnings ( 17 ) Balance as of June 30, 2022 135 Change in fair value of derivative instrument reported in earnings 94 Balance as of September 30, 2022 $ 229 Other Real Estate Owned : Other real estate owned represents real estate acquired through foreclosure, and is recorded at fair value less estimated disposal costs on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the asset is classified as Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the asset is classified as Level 3. Deposits : The fair values of demand deposits, savings, NOW and money market accounts equal their carrying amounts, which represent the amounts payable on demand at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-term, fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates on certificates of deposit to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on such deposits. Deposits are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. FHLBNY Advances : The fair value of the advances is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current market-based FHLBNY interest rates for advances of similar maturity to a schedule of maturities of such advances. These borrowings are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Warehouse Lines of Credit : The carrying amounts of warehouse lines of credit and mortgage loan funding payable approximate fair value and due to their short-term nature are classified as Level 2. Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments : Fair values for off-balance-sheet instruments (lending commitments and standby letters of credit) are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit standing. Off-balance-sheet instruments are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 39 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following tables detail the assets that are carried at fair value and measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and indicate the level within the fair value hierarchy utilized to determine the fair value: September 30, 2022 Description Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities, at fair value: U.S. Government Bonds $ 2,659 $ — $ 2,659 $ — Corporate bonds 23,358 — 18,799 4,559 Mortgage-Backed Securities: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 39,365 — 39,365 — FHLMC Certificates 9,793 9,793 FNMA Certificates 56,674 — 56,674 — GNMA Certificates 128 — 128 — Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at fair value 3,357 — 3,357 — Derivatives from interest rate lock commitments 229 — — 229 $ 135,563 $ — $ 130,775 $ 4,788 December 31, 2021 Description Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities: U.S. Government Bonds $ 2,934 $ — $ 2,934 $ — Corporate bonds 21,184 — 16,255 4,929 Mortgage-Backed Securities: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 18,348 — 18,348 — FNMA Certificates 70,699 — 70,699 — GNMA Certificates 181 — 181 — Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at fair value 15,836 — 15,836 — Derivatives from interest rate lock commitments 172 — — 172 $ 129,354 $ — $ 124,253 $ 5,101 Management’s assessment and classification of an investment within a level can change over time based upon maturity or liquidity of the investment and would be reflected at the beginning of the quarter in which the change occurred.

September 30, December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Beginning balance $ 4,929 $ 6,016 Total loss included in earnings ( 370 ) ( 87 ) Securities sold — ( 1,000 ) Ending balance $ 4,559 $ 4,929 The Company recognizes transfers between levels of the valuation hierarchy at the end of the applicable reporting periods. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 assets or liabilities in the fair value hierarchy at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Fair value for Level 3 securities was determined using a third-party pricing service with limited levels of activity and price transparency. Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments : Loan commitments on which the committed interest rate is less than the current market rate are insignificant at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The fair value information about financial instruments are disclosed, whether or not recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. The estimated fair value amounts for 2022 and 2021 have been measured as of their respective period-ends and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these consolidated financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than amounts reported at each period. The information presented should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only required for a limited portion of the Company's assets and liabilities. Due to the wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company's disclosures and those of other banks may not be meaningful. 42 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 14. Regulatory Capital Requirements The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s operations and financial statements. Under the regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total risk-based and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (as defined), common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined), and Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets (as defined) adjusted total assets (as defined). As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the applicable capital adequacy requirements specified below have been met. The below minimum capital requirements exclude the capital conservation buffer required to avoid limitations on capital distributions including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The applicable capital buffer for the Bank was 25.39 % at September 30, 2022 and 9.23 % at December 31, 2021. The most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Company and the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, common equity risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There were no conditions or events since then that have changed the Bank's category. The Company's and the Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 as compared to regulatory requirements are as follows: To Be Well Capitalized Under For Capital Prompt Corrective Actual Adequacy Purposes Action Provisions Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2022 Ponce Financial Group, Inc.

Segment Reporting The Company has two reportable segments: Ponce Bank and Mortgage World. Income from Ponce Bank consists primarily of interest earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts. Income from Mortgage World consists primarily of taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they are sold to investors. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of accounting policies. Segment profit and loss is measured by net income on an entity basis for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2021 but on an operations basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 in consolidation.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. (the “Company”). The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in Part I, Item 1, of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. On January 26, 2022, the assets and liabilities of Mortgage World Bankers, Inc. (“Mortgage World”), a wholly owned subsidiary of PDL Community Bancorp, were transferred to the Bank. Except for the winding up of its operations, Mortgage World ceased to conduct business as a separate entity and is now operated as a division of the Bank. On January 27, 2022, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and PDL Community Bancorp announced that the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from the mutual to stock form of organization and related stock offering was consummated at the close of business. As a result of the closing of the conversion and reorganization and stock offering, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. is now the holding company for Ponce Bank (“Ponce Bank” or the “Bank”). Ponce Bank’s former mutual holding companies, PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, have ceased to exist. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""intend,"" ""anticipate,"" ""assume,"" ""plan,"" ""seek,"" ""expect,"" ""will,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""indicate,"" ""would,"" ""believe,"" ""contemplate,"" ""continue,"" ""target"" and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: These forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company’s control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 48 Additional factors that may affect the Company’s results are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 under the heading “Risk Factors” filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 31, 2022, as updated in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Because of these and other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. The Company is under no duty to and does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Employees and Human Capital Resources As of September 30, 2022, the Company had 257 full time equivalent employees. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union, and management considers its relationship with employees to be good. The Company believes its ability to attract and retain employees is key to its success. Accordingly, the Company strives to offer competitive salaries and employee benefits to all employees and monitor salaries and other compensation in its market area. The Company encourages and supports the growth and development of its employees. Continual learning and career development is advanced through ongoing performance and development conversations with employees, internally developed training programs and educational reimbursement programs. The Company is responsible for creating an equitable workplace ensuring diversity at all management levels. The Company prides itself on establishing a diverse workforce that serves our diverse customer base in the New York metro area. The Company’s inclusion and diversity program focuses on its workforce, workplace, and community. The Company believes that its business is strengthened by a diverse workforce that reflects the communities in which it operates. The Company believes that all of its team members should be treated with respect and equality, regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious beliefs, or other characteristics. The Company has also broadened its focus on inclusion and diversity by including social and racial equity in its conversations and equipping and empowering its team leaders with appropriate tools and training. While it appears the COVID-19 pandemic has entered into an endemic stage, related measures taken by governments, businesses and individuals as a result of the pandemic continue to cause uncertainty, volatility and disruption in the economy, including the economies of the markets that we serve. In response to the pandemic, we adjusted our business practices, including restricting employee travel, encouraging employees to work from home when possible, implementing social distancing guidelines within our offices, and continuing to hold regular meetings of our pandemic response team. Certain of these measures remain in place due to the continued prevalence of the virus, though, as of September 30, 2022, all of our customer locations are open and the majority of our employees have schedules that include work at the office. 49 Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following discussion contains certain non-GAAP financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide the reader with additional supplemental perspective on operating results, performance trends, and financial condition. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial information. The Company’s non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP information which may be presented by other companies. In all cases, it should be understood that non-GAAP operating measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders. An item that management excludes when computing non-GAAP adjusted earnings can be of substantial importance to the Company’s results and condition for any particular year. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided below. The SEC has exempted from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on GAAP. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. However, the information should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The table below includes references to the Company's net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 before gain on sale of real property and the Company’s contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation. In management's view, that information, which is considered non-GAAP information, may be useful to investors as it will improve an understanding of core operations for the current and future periods. The non-GAAP net (loss) income amount and (loss) earnings per share reflect adjustments related to the non-recurring gain on sale of real property and the Company’s contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation, net of tax effect. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP information to GAAP net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share is provided below. Non-GAAP Reconciliation – Net (Loss) Income before Gain on Sale of Real Property and Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation (Unaudited) Nine Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net (loss) income - GAAP $ (20,787 ) $ 10,436 Loss (gain) on sale of premises and equipment 436 (4,812 ) Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation 4,995 — Income tax (benefit) provision (1,141 ) 1,011 Net (loss) income - non-GAAP $ (16,497 ) $ 6,635 (Loss) earnings per common share (GAAP) (1) $ (0.92 ) $ 0.62 (Loss) earnings per common share (non-GAAP) (1) $ (0.73 ) $ 0.40 COVID-19 Pandemic and the CARES Act On March 27, 2020, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) to address the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act appropriated $349.0 billion for PPP loans and on April 24, 2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) received another $310.0 billion in PPP funding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act appropriated $284.0 billion for both first and second draw PPP loans, bringing the total appropriations for PPP loans to $943.0 billion. PPP ended on May 31, 2021. Loans under the PPP that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The Company had received SBA approval and originated 5,340 PPP loans, of which 274 loans totaling $24.7 million were outstanding at September 30, 2022. PPP loans have a two-year or five-year term, provide for fees of up to 5% of the loan amount and earn interest at a rate of 1% per annum. It is our expectation that a significant portion of these remaining loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. As of September 30, 2022, the average authorized loan size was $90,000 and the median authorized loan size was $12,000. The Bank, which is designated as both a Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) and a Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), originated 5,340 PPP loans in the amount of $261.4 million, which, based upon information provided by the SBA, significantly exceeded the reported average performance of banks in our peer group. 50 As a result of the initial COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the Company continues to alter the way it has historically provided services to its deposit customers while seeking to maintain normal day-to-day back-office operations and lending functions. To that end, as of September 30, 2022, all back-office and lending personnel have been formed into teams which alternate between a remote and in office work environment while the branch network continues to provide traditional banking services to its communities and has for the most part returned to normal operating hours while continuing to shift service delivery to electronic and web-based products. The Company continues its extensive and intensive communications program geared to informing customers of the alternative resources provided by the Company for retaining access to financial services, closing loans and conducting banking transactions, such as ATM networks, online banking, mobile applications, remote deposits and the Company’s Contact Center. The Company proactively manages its day-to-day operations by using video and telephonic conferencing. The Company remains vigilant of the potential for other COVID-19 variant outbreaks and remains prepared to restore the necessary protocols to minimize any disruptions to its current operations and services. Federal Economic Relief Funds To Aid Lending On August 10, 2021, the Company through its subsidiary, the Bank, received from the United States Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) a grant in the amount of $1.8 million in federal Economic Relief Funds for Small Businesses under the Treasury’s Rapid Response Program for CDFIs. The Rapid Response Program grants may be used to support eligible activities of CDFIs such as financial products, financial services, development services, and certain operational activities, and to enable recipient CDFIs to build capital reserves and loan-loss reserves. On June 7, 2022, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. (the “Company”), the holding company for Ponce Bank,‎ closed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 225,000 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A‎, par value $0.01 (the “Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price equal to $225,000,000 in cash, to the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) pursuant to the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”).‎ The holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a dividend payable in cash quarterly at an annual rate dependent on certain factors as reported by the Company to Treasury in a quarterly supplemental report. The initial dividend rate is zero percent for the first two years after issuance, and thereafter the floor dividend rate is 0.50% and the ceiling dividend rate is 2.00%. After 10 years of issuance, the perpetual dividend rate in effect, will be determined based on said floor and ceiling. The actual dividend rate that will be paid by the Company on the Preferred Stock cannot be determined at this time. The ECIP investment by the Treasury is part of a program to invest over $8.7 billion into Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) or ‎Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), of which Ponce Bank is both. The ECIP is intended to incentivize CDFIs and MDIs to provide loans, grants, ‎and forbearance to small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers in low-income and underserved communities that may have been ‎disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. Critical Accounting Policies Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management and that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets, liabilities or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is established as probable incurred losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. See Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the accompanying Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. 51 Factors Affecting the Comparability of Results Sale of Real Property. On February 11, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 3821 Bergenline Avenue, Union City, New Jersey for a sale price of $2.4 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $145,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.5%. Under the lease agreement, the Bank has four (4) consecutive options to extend the term of the lease by five (5) years for each such option. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $623,000, net of expenses, which is included in non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. On June 4, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 5560 Broadway, Bronx, New York for a sale price of $5.7 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $281,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.75%. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $4.2 million, net of expenses, which is included in non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Ponce De Leon Foundation. On January 27, 2022, the Company made a $5.0 million contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation as part of the conversion and reorganization, which is included in non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Write-off and Write-Down. In 2020, the Company entered into a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain. Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to $1,000 and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originates and services these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan is found to be fraudulent, becomes 90 days delinquent upon 90 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.” The Bank, pursuant to its agreement with Grain, at December 31, 2021, had 59,180 microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with credit extensions aggregating $33.9 million. Of these microloans, the Bank estimates that 80 percent have been made in low- and low-to-moderate income census tracts with an estimated 56 percent made to minority borrowers. At September 30, 2022, the Bank had 47,470 Grain microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $21.5 million and which were performing, in management’s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by an $8.2 million allowance for loan losses, resulting in $13.3 million in Grain microloans, net of allowance for loan losses. Since the beginning of the Bank’s agreement with Grain and through September 30, 2022, 45,322 microloans amounting to $25.5 million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain. The Company has written-down a total of $17.5 million of the Grain Receivable for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and received $6.2 million in cash from Grain and through the application of security deposits connected to fraudulent loan accounts. The Bank also opted to use the $1.8 million grant it received from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Rapid Response ‎Program to defray the Grain Receivable. The application of those amounts resulted in no net receivable. Additionally, the Company has also written-off its equity investment in Grain of $1.0 million. As of September 30, 2022, the Company’s total exposure to Grain was $13.3 million of the remaining microloans, net of allowance for loan losses and a $15.3 million of unused commitments available to Grain borrowers. The $7.9 million and $17.5 million write-off and write-down for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, is included in non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 52 Grain Technologies, Inc.

Grain remains a pre-profit startup highly dependent on earnings from its relationship with the Bank, a new relationship with another financial institution, and further capital raises which may not materialize. The Company continues to closely monitor its portfolio of consumer loans originated by Grain as well as Grain’s refinement of solutions for detecting and preventing cyber fraud in the application for microloans. The Company has requested, and Grain has agreed, that no new microloans be originated until further notice and that further extensions of credit to an existing microloan borrower only be made upon confirmation that such borrower is not fraudulent. Further, like other start-up companies, there is a higher level of risk that Grain may not be able to execute its business plan and may fail. In the event Grain were to cease operations, and although it has considered contingency plans, the Bank may have greater difficulty in servicing and collecting the microloan portfolio. In such a case, the level the Bank has provided for in its allowance for loan losses for its microloan portfolio may be inadequate and it may need to increase its provision for loan losses, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. As a consequence of such events, the Bank may determine it appropriate to terminate its relationship with Grain. Additionally, the Company has written-off its $1.0 million equity investment in Grain. The $7.9 million and $17.5 million write-off and write-down is included in non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Vision 2025 Evolves The Company is now in the later stages of its multi-pronged effort to upgrade its infrastructure, adopt electronic banking services and restructure its retail business model. Dubbed internally “Vision 2020,” the effort has resulted in significant beneficial results, continues to involve significant investments and has served to ameliorate the otherwise detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of Vision 2020, the Company partnered with Salesforce to deploy applications throughout the organization, including retail services, lending processes, back-office operations, digital banking and loan underwriting. Although the full implementation of the applications, dubbed internally as “GPS, a Guided Path to Success,” was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was fully implemented by the end 2021. The infrastructure upgrade has focused primarily on implementing technology, cybersecurity and network progression while establishing a Virtual Private Network (“VPN”). To date the infrastructure upgrade has resulted in relocating and migrating network and in-house servers, replacing outdated PCs, enhancing internet capabilities, purchasing and deploying VPN-enabled laptops to a significant majority of the Bank’s personnel and the redeployment of disaster recovery capabilities. The Company has achieved certain manpower-related cost savings and enabled the uninterrupted continuity of operations by its staff working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic using its newly deployed disaster recovery capabilities. The infrastructure upgrade has added resiliency, capacity and redundancies to the Company’s technology structures and enhances the capability of the Company to increase its flexibility with alternate locations of personnel. The Company has adopted and deployed over 48 new electronic banking services, products and applications since late 2018. These services range from on-line banking, mobile banking, bill pay, positive pay, remote deposit capture, cash management services, 53 e-statements, data storage and management, ACH services, electronic document storage, a paperless environment, dual-language telephone banking service and VoIP telecommunications with an automation-based, dual-language Customer Contact Center. These services have not only enabled the Company to continue serving its customers as they, and the Company, converted to a remote work environment; the services have served to increase the product penetration and deepening relationships with customers. The Company has also added to its social media capabilities and has begun to use them in coordination with new targeted marketing campaigns now enabled by GPS and its Marketing Cloud platform. The combination of social media and targeted marketing campaigns was particularly effective with PPP loan originations using many partnerships established with non-profit groups and community-based organizations. Such efforts enabled the Company to more than triple the number of second round PPP loan applications compared to the first round, and has resulted in significant growth in retail deposits and new relationships. The Company has deployed a Fintech-based small business automated lending technology in partnership with LendingFront Technologies, Inc. The technology is a mobile application that digitizes the lending workflow from pre-approval to servicing and enables the Company to originate, close and fund small business loans within very short spans of time, without requiring a physical presence within banking offices and with automated underwriting using both traditional and non-traditional methods. The application has full loan origination and servicing capabilities and is integrated with Salesforce. All Commercial Relationship Officers and Business Development Managers will utilize these capabilities upon the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic and completion of a pilot test. The Company is seeking to establish loan origination partnerships with non-profit and community-based organizations to ensure penetration in underserved and underbanked markets. The Company also established a relationship with SaveBetter, LLC, a fintech startup focusing on brokered deposits. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had $224.1 million in such deposits. The recent regulatory easing of brokered deposit rules may enable the Company to classify such deposits as core deposits. The Company’s on-going adoption of a new retail business model has been all-encompassing. It has involved the redesign of its retail branches, the shift of branch operations to a centralized back office, the deployment of smart ITM-enabled ATMs and Teller Cash Recyclers, the automation of manual processes and, importantly, the adoption of universal bankers and retail sales. In 2019, the Company earned national recognition as Branch Innovators of the Year for its retail banking model at the 2019 Future Branches Retail Banking Summit in Austin, Texas. The Company continues to renovate its branches at costs significantly less than previous efforts largely as a result of economies of scale, design modifications and adoption of buildout techniques used by non-bank retail organizations. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company completed the drawing and engineering phases of Southern Boulevard and Smith Street branches and have completed engineering surveys of the Jackson Heights and Union City branches. The Company is now on track to begin renovation during the first quarter of 2023 at Southern Boulevard and Smith Street branches and for Jackson Heights, Westchester and Union City branches during second quarter of 2023. Surveys are completed for Forest Hills and Stuyvesant Town branches, but commencement of design and construction has not yet been scheduled at these locations. The Company continues to incorporate loan origination personnel into its retail branches including a branded Ponce Mortgage Center celebrating the comprehensive offerings made possible by our affiliate the Ponce De Leon Mortgage Corporation as well as the Bank’s new division, Mortgage World. The Company still anticipates creating a full-service branch at its mortgage office located in Flushing, Queens, New York and a banking satellite at its office in Bergenfield, New Jersey. These projects are temporarily on hold pending completion of other renovations. The Company’s mortgage office in Flushing, Queens, will expand the Company’s reach into one of the most underserved areas of Queens according to recently reported PPP loan penetration data. Vision 2020 already has had a transformational effect on the Company. The Company had approximately $1.06 billion in assets, $918.5 million in loans and $809.8 million in deposits, at December 31, 2018. The Company has since grown to $2.16 billion in assets, $1.39 billion in loans receivables, net of allowance for loan losses of $25.1 million, and $1.35 billion in deposits at September 30, 2022, all while investing in infrastructure, implementing digital banking, acquiring Mortgage World, adopting GPS, diversifying its product offering, meeting the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, partnering with Fintech companies and assisting its communities with 5,340 PPP loans totaling $261.4 million. The Company raised over $132.0 million in additional capital through our conversion and reorganization and realized approximately $20.0 million in net gain while freeing up approximately $40.0 million in investable funds through our sale-and-leaseback initiative. Now, the Company believes that it is poised to enhance its presence, locally and in similar communities outside New York, as a leading CDFI and MDI financial institution holding company. On June 7, 2022, the Company issued 225,000 shares of the Company’s Preferred Stock‎, par value $0.01 for an aggregate purchase price equal to $225,000,000 in cash to the Treasury, pursuant to the Treasury’s ECIP‎. Under the ECIP, Treasury provided investment capital directly to depository institutions that are CDFIs or MDIs or their holding companies, to provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers, in low-income and underserved communities. Treasury has indicated that the investment will qualify as Tier 1 capital . No dividends will accrue or be due for the first two years after issuance. For years three through ten, depending upon the level of qualified and/or deep impact lending made in targeted communities, as defined in the ECIP guidelines, dividends will be at an annual rate of either 2.0%, 1.25% or 0.5% and, thereafter, will be fixed at one of the foregoing rates. Holders of Preferred Stock generally do not have any voting rights, with the exception of voting rights on certain matters as outlined in the Certificate of Designations. The Company has the option to redeem the shares of Preferred Stock (i) in whole or in part on any 54 dividend payment date on or after June 15, 2027, or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within ninety days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, as defined in the Purchase Agreement, in each case at a cash redemption price equal to the liquidation amount, with an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not paid prior to the redemption date. The Company may not redeem shares of Preferred Stock without having received the prior approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency for the Company, as defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, to the extent required under applicable capital rules. Such redemptions are subject to certain conditions and limitations, as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. The Company is cementing Vision 2025, its roadmap to acquiring the resources needed to lead efforts to remediate the disparate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising costs due to inflation and the wealth and financial gaps present in its communities and similar communities outside the New York City metropolitan area. The Company traces its roots to its organization in 1960 as Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association by Latino leaders concerned that the financial needs of the Bronx and its Latino population were not being recognized and addressed. True to its roots, the Company remains committed to ensuring that the disparate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising costs due to inflation and the wealth and financial gaps present in minority communities are addressed in earnest. The following table presents the Company’s PPP loans outstanding as of September 30, 2022: Aggregate Median Average Number Amount Amount Amount State Counties of Loans of Loans of Loans of Loans (Dollars in thousands) New York Albany 1 $ 98 $ 98 $ 98 Bronx 72 2,344 12 33 Dutchess 1 10 10 10 Kings 34 15,950 18 469 Nassau 13 129 7 10 New York 39 2,414 15 62 Orange 1 11 11 11 Queens 65 1,483 14 23 Richmond 1 11 11 11 Suffolk 8 111 11 14 Westchester 7 78 9 11 Total New York 242 $ 22,639 $ 12 $ 94 New Jersey Bergen 6 $ 378 $ 14 $ 63 Camden 1 21 21 21 Essex 8 71 5 9 Hudson 7 1,003 15 143 Mercer 2 52 26 26 Monmouth 1 507 507 507 Ocean 2 11 5 6 Passaic 2 24 12 12 Union 2 16 8 8 Total New Jersey 31 $ 2,083 $ 12 $ 67 Pennsylvania Berks 1 16 16 16 Total 274 $ 24,738 $ 12 $ 90 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 Total Assets . Total consolidated assets increased $504.8 million, or 30.5%, to $2.16 billion at September 30, 2022 from $1.65 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in total assets is largely attributable to an increase of $493.4 million resulting from the purchases in held-to-maturity securities utilizing the $225.0 million received from the issuance of preferred stock to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to its Emergency Capital Investment Program. The increase in total assets is further impacted by an increase of $87.5 million in net loans receivable (inclusive of a $112.0 million net decrease in PPP loans), partially offset by a decrease of $91.4 million in cash and equivalents. Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents decreased $91.4 million, or 59.4%, to $62.5 million at September 30, 2022, compared to $153.9 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of purchases of securities, mostly held to maturity securities, net purchases of FHLBNY stock, an increase in net loans and a contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was offset from proceeds for the issuance of Preferred Stock to the Treasury, proceeds from advances from the FHLBNY, an increase in net deposits, proceeds from maturities/calls of securities, a decrease in advances of warehouse lines of credit and the sale of loans. 55 Securities. The composition of securities at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and the amounts maturing of each classification are summarized as follows: September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Amortized Fair Amortized Fair Cost Value Cost Value (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities: U.S. Government Bonds: Amounts maturing: Three months or less $ — $ — $ — $ — More than three months through one year — — — — More one year through five years 2,984 2,659 2,981 2,934 More than five years through ten years — — — — 2,984 2,659 2,981 2,934 Corporate Bonds: Amounts maturing: Three months or less — — — — More than three months through one year — — — — More one year through five years 4,000 3,684 4,445 4,381 More than five years through ten years 21,833 19,674 16,798 16,803 25,833 23,358 21,243 21,184 Mortgage-Backed Securities 126,310 105,960 90,950 89,228 Total Available-for-Sale Securities $ 155,127 $ 131,977 $ 115,174 $ 113,346 Held-to-Maturity Securities: U.S. Agency Bonds: Amounts maturing: Three months or less $ — $ — $ — $ — More than three months through one year — — — — More one year through five years 25,000 24,692 — — More than five years through ten years — — — — 25,000 24,692 — — Corporate Bonds: Amounts maturing: Three months or less $ — $ — $ — $ — More than three months through one year — — — — More one year through five years 75,000 72,119 — — More than five years through ten years 5,500 5,139 — — 80,500 77,258 — — Mortgage-Backed Securities 388,797 377,352 934 914 Total Held-to-Maturity Securities $ 494,297 $ 479,302 $ 934 $ 914 The Company securities portfolio increased $493.4 million in held-to-maturity and $18.6 million in available-for-sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase was mainly attributable to $501.9 million in held-to-maturity securities and $58.4 million in available-for-sale securities that were purchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase was offset primarily by $21.4 million in principal payments, $21.3 million in unrealized loss and two available-for-sale securities in the amount of $5.4 million that matured and/or were called during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. There were no available-for-sale securities sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. There were no held-to-maturity securities sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company invested primarily in held-to-maturity securities utilizing the $225.0 million the Company received from the issuance of preferred stock to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to its Emergency Capital Investment Program and from cash received from deposits made by its customers. 56 Gross Loans Receivable. The composition of gross loans receivable at September 30, 2022 and at December 31, 2021 and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows: September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Increase (Decrease) Amount Percent Amount Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential Investor-Owned $ 336,667 23.8 % $ 317,304 24.1 % $ 19,363 6.1 % Owner-Occupied 112,749 8.0 % 96,947 7.3 % 15,802 16.3 % Multifamily residential 421,917 29.8 % 348,300 26.3 % 73,617 21.1 % Nonresidential properties 282,642 20.0 % 239,691 18.1 % 42,951 17.9 % Construction and land 197,437 13.9 % 134,651 10.2 % 62,786 46.6 % Total mortgage loans 1,351,412 95.5 % 1,136,893 86.0 % 214,519 18.9 % Nonmortgage loans: Business loans (1) 41,398 2.9 % 150,512 11.4 % (109,114 ) (72.5 %) Consumer loans (2) 22,563 1.6 % 34,693 2.6 % (12,130 ) (35.0 %) 63,961 4.5 % 185,205 14.0 % (121,244 ) (65.5 %) Total $ 1,415,373 100.0 % $ 1,322,098 100.0 % $ 93,275 7.1 % The $93.3 million increase in the gross loan portfolio was primarily the result of an increase of $205.3 million in non-PPP loans, offset by a $112.0 million decrease in PPP loans at September 30, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. Based on current internal loan reviews, the Company believes that the quality of our underwriting, our weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 57.9% and our customer selection processes have served us well and provided us with a reliable base with which to maintain a well-protected loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans, as defined by applicable banking regulations, include multifamily residential, nonresidential properties, and construction and land mortgage loans. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximately 7.0% and 7.9%, respectively, of the outstanding principal balance of the Bank’s commercial real estate mortgage loans were secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses predominantly on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on valuation of the real estate. Banking regulations have established guidelines relating to the amount of construction and land mortgage loans and investor- owned commercial real estate mortgage loans of 100% and 300% of total risk-based capital, respectively. Should a bank’s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. The Bank’s policy is to operate within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and up to 400% for investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank’s total risk-based capital. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bank’s construction and land mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 40.4% and 79.6%, respectively. Investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 173.6% and 396.2% as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. At September 30, 2022, the Bank was within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and the 300% guideline for investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans established by banking regulators. Management believes that it has established the appropriate level of controls to monitor the Bank’s lending in these areas. Mortgage Loans Held For Sale . Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, at September 30, 2022 decreased $12.5 million, or 78.8%, to $3.4 million from $15.8 million at December 31, 2021. 57 Deposits. The composition of deposits at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and changes in dollars and percentages are summarized as follows: September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Increase (Decrease) Percent Percent Amount of Total Amount of Total Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Demand $ 288,654 21.4 % $ 274,956 22.8 % $ 13,698 5.0 % Interest-bearing deposits: NOW/IOLA accounts 28,799 2.1 % 35,280 2.9 % (6,481 ) (18.4 %) Money market accounts 360,293 26.7 % 186,893 15.5 % 173,400 92.8 % Reciprocal deposits 162,858 12.1 % 143,221 11.9 % 19,637 13.7 % Savings accounts 140,055 10.3 % 134,887 11.2 % 5,168 3.8 % Total NOW, money market, reciprocal and savings 692,005 51.2 % 500,281 41.5 % 191,724 38.3 % Certificates of deposit of $250K or more 61,900 4.6 % 78,454 6.5 % (16,554 ) (21.1 %) Brokered certificates of deposit (1) 98,760 7.3 % 79,320 6.6 % 19,440 24.5 % Listing service deposits (1) 40,964 3.0 % 66,411 5.5 % (25,447 ) (38.3 %) Certificates of deposit less than $250K 168,906 12.5 % 205,294 17.0 % (36,388 ) (17.7 %) Total certificates of deposit 370,530 27.4 % 429,479 35.6 % (58,949 ) (13.7 %) Total interest-bearing deposits 1,062,535 78.6 % 929,760 77.1 % 132,775 14.3 % Total deposits $ 1,351,189 100.0 % $ 1,204,716 100.0 % $ 146,473 12.2 % When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the Company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk and interest rate risk in line with management objectives. The Company’s Interest Rate Risk Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding and noncore funding reliance. The overall reliance on wholesale funding and noncore funding were within those policy limitations as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Management Asset/Liability Committee generally meets on a bi-weekly basis to review funding needs, if any, and to ensure the Company operates within the approved limitations. Advances from FHLBNY . The Bank had outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 of $261.4 million and $106.3 million in term advances from the FHLBNY, respectively and $25.0 million of overnight line of credit advance from the FHLBNY at September 30, 2022. The Bank had no overnight line of credit advance from the FHLBNY at December 31, 2021. Warehouse Lines of Credit . At December 31, 2021, Mortgage World had maintained two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the origination and sale of residential mortgages. At December 31, 2021, Mortgage World utilized $15.1 million for funding of mortgage loans held for sale and had unused lines of credit of $14.9 million. At September 30, 2022, there was no remaining balance on such lines of credit. During the first quarter of 2022, Mortgage World became a division of the Bank and the Bank began funding these loans. Stockholders’ Equity . The Company’s consolidated stockholders’ equity increased $311.4 million, or 164.6%, to $500.7 million at September 30, 2022 from $189.3 million at December 31, 2021. This increase in stockholders’ equity was largely attributable to the $225.0 million issuance of preferred stock to the U.S. Department of the Treasury pursuant to its Emergency Capital Investment Program and the $118.0 million received as a result of the sale of common stock in the conversion of the mutual holding company to a stock company. Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 The discussion of the Company’s results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 are presented below. The results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of future results. Ponce Financial Group, Inc., as the successor by merger with PDL Community Bancorp Consolidated Overview. Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was ($14.7) million compared to net income of $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. Earnings per basic and diluted share was ($0.64) for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.12 for three months ended September 30, 2021. The $16.8 million decrease of net income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was due to increases of $10.7 million in non-interest expenses and $8.8 million in provision for loan losses and a decrease of $1.7 million of non-interest income. The decrease in net income was offset by an increase of $2.2 million in net interest income and a $2.1 million decrease in provision for income taxes. 58 Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $4.2 million, or 24.2%, to $21.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from $17.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. Interest income on loans receivable, which is the Company’s primary source of income, increased $67,000, or 0.4%, to $17.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from $17.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. Interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks increased $4.1 million, or 954.4%, to $4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from $434,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2021. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $2.0 million, or 102.7%, to $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to an increase average cost of funds. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $2.2 million, or 14.1%, to $17.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from $15.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to three months ended September 30, 2021 was attributable to an increase of $4.2 million in interest and dividend income primarily due to increases of $3.8 million in interest and dividend on securities and FHLBNY stock, $337,000 in interest on deposits due from banks and $67,000 in interest on loans receivable, offset by an increase of $2.0 million in interest expense due primarily to a higher average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest rate spread decreased by 80 basis points to 3.12% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from 3.92% for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in the net interest rate spread for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in the average yields on interest-earning assets of 21 basis points to 4.45% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from 4.66% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, and an increase in the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 59 basis points to 1.33% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from 0.74% for the three months ended September 30, 2021. Net interest margin decreased 51 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2022, to 3.62% from 4.13% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, reflecting the increased cost of interest-bearing liabilities offset by income on securities and our organic loan growth. The historically low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response the turmoil resulting from COVID-19 pandemic is ending. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 3.75%-4.00% during its November 2022 meeting, the fifth consecutive rate hike, and pushing borrowing costs to the highest level since 2017. The Federal Reserve has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases at its next meeting in December 2022. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. The Bank believes it is well positioned to withstand this rising interest rate environment in the near term as it is asset sensitive. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income decreased $1.7 million, or 51.2%, to $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was due to a decrease of $1.1 million in income on sale of mortgage loans, a loss of $436,000 from the sales of equipment, decreases of $220,000 in late and prepayment charges and $103,000 in loan origination fee. The decrease in non-interest income was offset by an increase of $173,000 in other non-interest income. Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $10.7 million, or 72.5%, to $25.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from $14.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was attributable to an increase of $7.9 million in write-off in the third quarter of 2022 related to the receivable due from Grain for microloans originated by Grain and put back to Grain due to fraud and write-off $1.0 million of the Company investment in Grain. The increase in non-interest expense was also impacted by increases of $950,000 in compensation and benefits, $762,000 in occupancy and equipment and $467,000 in other operating expenses, offset by decreases of $514,000 in professional fees and $257,000 in office supplies, telephone and postage. The increase of $950,000 in compensation and benefits mostly related to new hires. Income Tax (Benefit) Provision. The Company had a benefit for income taxes of $820,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to a provision for income taxes of $1.3 million for three months ended September 30, 2021. Segments. The Company has two reportable segments; the Bank and, for the three months ended September 30, 2021, Mortgage World, and, for the three months ended September 30, 2022, Mortgage World as a division of the Bank. Income from the Bank consists primarily of interest and fees earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts. Income from Mortgage World consists primarily of taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they are sold to investors. 59 The table below shows the results of operations for the Company’s segments, the Bank and Mortgage World, for the periods indicated.

The Bank’s, excluding Mortgage World, total assets increased $514.7 million, or 31.6%, to $2.14 billion at September 30, 2022 from $1.6 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in the Bank’s total assets was primarily due to increases of $493.4 million in held-to-maturity securities, $87.5 million in net loans receivable (inclusive of a $112.0 million net decrease in PPP loans), $18.6 million in available-for-sale securities, $8.3 million in FHLBNY stock, $8.1 million in deferred tax assets and $1.6 million in accrued interest receivable. The increase in total assets was offset by decreases of $90.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $10.5 million in other assets and $1.8 million in premises and equipment. Net Income (Loss). The Bank’s net loss was ($10.5) million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to net income of $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to increases of $9.7 million in non-interest expenses and $8.8 million in provision in loan losses, a decrease of $526,000 in non-interest income, offset by increases of $3.2 million in benefit for income taxes and $2.1 million in net interest income. Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $4.2 million, or 24.4%, to $21.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from $17.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. This increase is attributable to increases of $3.8 million in interest on securities, $337,000 interest on deposits due from banks and $6,000 in dividend on FHLBNY stock. Interest income on loans receivable increased $84,000, or 0.5% to $17.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from $16.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. 62 The following table presents interest income on loans receivable for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) 1-4 Family residential $ 4,949 $ 5,028 $ (79 ) (1.6 %) Multifamily residential 4,472 3,566 906 25.4 % Nonresidential properties 3,142 2,524 618 24.5 % Construction and land 3,011 2,117 894 42.2 % Business loans 539 2,996 (2,457 ) (82.0 %) Consumer loans 870 668 202 30.2 % Total interest income on loans receivable $ 16,983 $ 16,899 $ 84 0.5 % The following table presents interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Interest on deposits due from banks $ 346 $ 9 $ 337 3,744.4 % Interest on securities 4,154 355 3,799 1,070.1 % Dividend on FHLBNY stock 76 70 6 8.6 % Total interest and dividend income $ 4,576 $ 434 $ 4,142 954.4 % Interest Expense.

Net interest income increased $2.1 million, or 13.7%, to $17.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from $15.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily as a result of investment in securities and organic loan growth, offset by a higher average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish the ALLL that, in management’s opinion, should be adequate to provide coverage for the inherent losses on outstanding loans. In evaluating the level of the ALLL, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. See Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —Allowance for Loan Losses” of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 63 After an evaluation of these factors, the Bank established a provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 of $9.3 million compared to $572,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The provision for loan losses during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was impacted by the change in qualitative factors during the period related to the microloans originated by Grain. The provision for loan losses during the three months ended September 30, 2022 primarily reflects the Bank’s assessment of the economic impact of inflation and to a lesser extent the COVID-19 pandemic on borrowers and their ability to repay in the short-term. Non-interest Income . Non-interest income decreased $526,000, or 37.0%, to $896,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, mainly attributable to a one-time $436,000 loss on sale of equipment in addition to a decrease of $220,000 in late and prepayment charges. The following table presents non-interest income for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Service charges and fees $ 464 $ 494 $ (30 ) (6.1 %) Brokerage commissions 164 79 85 107.6 % Late and prepayment charges 109 329 (220 ) (66.9 %) Loss on sale of premises and equipment (436 ) — (436 ) — % Other 595 520 75 14.4 % Total non-interest income $ 896 $ 1,422 $ (526 ) (37.0 %) Non-interest Expense . Non-interest expense increased $9.7 million, or 80.2%, to $21.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from $12.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an additional write-offs of $7.9 million related to the Grain Receivable due from Grain for microloans originated by Grain and put back to Grain and a $1.0 million investment in Grain. Other increases to non-interest expenses were compensation and benefits and occupancy and equipment, offset by decreases in other operating expenses and professional fees. The following table presents non-interest expense for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Compensation and benefits $ 5,729 $ 4,825 $ 904 18.7 % Occupancy and equipment 3,419 2,805 614 21.9 % Data processing expenses 976 917 59 6.4 % Direct loan expenses 547 368 179 48.6 % Insurance and surety bond premiums 259 147 112 76.2 % Office supplies, telephone and postage 324 431 (107 ) (24.8 %) Professional fees 952 1,355 (403 ) (29.7 %) Grain write-off and write-down 8,881 — 8,881 — % Marketing and promotional expenses 204 48 156 325.0 % Directors fees 89 67 22 32.8 % Regulatory assessment 99 74 25 33.8 % Other operating expenses 387 1,096 (709 ) (64.7 %) Total non-interest expense $ 21,866 $ 12,133 $ 9,733 80.2 % Mortgage World Segment Total Assets.

The decrease in Mortgage World’s total assets was primarily due to decreases of $12.5 million in mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value and $2.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Net Income (Loss). Mortgage World’s net loss was ($841,000) for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to net income of $86,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2021. 64 Non-interest Income . Non-interest income decreased $1.1 million, or 55.0%, to $937,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021.

The results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of future results. Ponce Financial Group, Inc., as the successor by merger with PDL Community Bancorp Consolidated Overview. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was ($20.8) million compared to net income of $10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Loss per basic and diluted share was ($0.92) for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.62 for nine months ended September 30, 2021. The net loss from net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was due to an increase of $28.8 million in non-interest expense (of which $17.5 million was attributable to the write-off and write-down related to the Grain Receivable and $1.0 million of the Company investments in Grain and $5.0 million was the contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation). The net loss was also impacted by an increase of $9.6 million in provision for loan losses and a decrease of $9.5 million in non-interest income, offset by increases of $8.4 million in net interest income and an $8.2 million benefit for income taxes. Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $9.4 million, or 19.4%, to $57.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from $48.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Interest income on loans receivable, which is the Company’s primary source of income, increased $3.8 million, or 8.0%, to $51.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from $47.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to an increase in loans receivable in all categories except for a decrease of $112.0 million in PPP lending. Average loans receivable increased $31.4 million, or 2.4% to $1.34 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to $1.31 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks increased $5.6 million, or 601.6%, to $6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from $927,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $1.0 million, or 15.7%, to $7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from $6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to a higher average cost of funds. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $8.4 million, or 19.9%, to $50.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from $42.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The $8.4 million increase in net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2021 was attributable to an increase of $9.4 million in interest and dividend income primarily due to increases in average loans receivable and interest and dividend on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks, offset by an increase of $1.0 million in interest expense due primarily to a higher average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest rate spread decreased by 1 basis point to 3.76% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from 3.77% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in the net interest rate spread for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 9 basis points to 0.92% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from 0.83% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and an increase in the average yields on interest-earning assets of 8 basis points to 4.68% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from 4.60% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Net interest margin increased 10 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to 4.09% from 3.99% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, reflecting both our organic loan growth and the amortization of fee income from our PPP lending. 66 The historically low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response the turmoil resulting from COVID-19 pandemic is ending. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 3.75%-4.00% during its November 2022 meeting, the fifth consecutive rate hike, and pushing borrowing costs to the highest level since 2017. The Federal Reserve has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases at its next meeting in December 2022. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. The Bank believes it is well positioned to withstand this rising interest rate environment in the near term as it is asset sensitive. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income decreased $9.5 million, or 61.3%, to $6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from $15.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was due to a one-time $4.8 million gain, net of expenses, from the sale of real properties recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, decreases of $3.2 million in income on sale of mortgage loans and $511,000 in late and prepayment charges, a one-time loss of $436,000 on the sale of equipment, decreases of $292,000 in loan origination fees and $275,000 in other non-interest income. The decrease in non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was offset by an increase of $160,000 in service charges and fees. Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $28.8 million, or 69.7%, to $70.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from $41.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The $28.8 million increase in non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was attributable to an aggregate $17.5 million write-off and write down related to the receivable due from Grain for microloans originated by Grain and put back to Grain due to fraud and a $1.0 million write-off of the Company's investment in Grain. Other increases in non-interest expense included $5.1 million in compensation and benefits, a $5.0 million contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation in connection with the conversion from a mutual holding company to a stock company during the first quarter of 2022, $1.7 million in occupancy and equipment reflecting rental expenses on facilities that were sold and leased back by the Company, increases of $421,000 in data processing expenses, $396,000 in other operating expenses and $200,000 in marketing and promotional expenses. The increase in non-interest expense was offset by decreases of $1.6 million in professional fees, $823,000 in direct loan expenses and $322,000 in offices supplies, telephone and postage. Income Tax (Benefit) Provision. The Company had a benefit for income taxes of ($4.3) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to a provision for income taxes of $4.0 million for nine months ended September 30, 2021, resulting in effective tax rates of 17.0% and 27.5%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to an increase of $4.1 million in the valuation allowance related to the unused non-deductible portion of the remaining charitable contribution deduction. Segments. The Company has two reportable segments; the Bank and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, Mortgage World, and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Mortgage World as a division of the Bank. Income from the Bank consists primarily of interest and fees earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts. Income from Mortgage World consists primarily of taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they are sold to investors. The table below shows the results of operations for the Company’s segments, the Bank and Mortgage World, for the periods indicated. 67 Ponce Bank Mortgage World For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 Dollars Percent 2022 2021 Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Interest and dividend income $ 57,519 $ 48,122 $ 9,397 19.5 % $ 300 $ 324 $ (24 ) (7.4 %) Interest expense 7,519 6,220 1,299 20.9 % 93 284 (191 ) (67.3 %) Net interest income 50,000 41,902 8,098 19.3 % 207 40 167 417.5 % Provision for loan losses 11,405 1,844 9,561 518.5 % — — — — % Net interest income after provision for loan losses 38,595 40,058 (1,463 ) (3.7 %) 207 40 167 417.5 % Non-interest income 3,238 9,193 (5,955 ) (64.8 %) 3,252 7,081 (3,829 ) (54.1 %) Non-interest expense 55,358 32,742 22,616 69.1 % 6,003 6,840 (837 ) (12.2 %) (Loss) income before income taxes (13,525 ) 16,509 (30,034 ) (181.9 %) (2,544 ) 281 (2,825 ) (1,005.3 %) (Benefit) provision for income taxes (2,432 ) 3,717 (6,149 ) (165.4 %) — 74 (74 ) (100.0 %) Net (loss) income $ (11,093 ) $ 12,792 $ (23,885 ) (186.7 %) $ (2,544 ) $ 207 $ (2,751 ) (1,329.0 %) Average Balance Sheets The following table sets forth average outstanding balances, average yields and rates, and certain other information for the periods indicated.

The Bank’s net loss was ($11.1) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to net income of $12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to an increase in non-interest expense as a result of an aggregate $17.5 million write-off and write down related to the Grain receivable and a $1.0 million write-off of investment by the Company related to Grain. Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $9.4 million, or 19.5%, to $57.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from $48.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Interest income on loans receivable, which is the Bank’s primary source of income, increased $3.8 million, or 8.1% to $51.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from $47.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Interest and dividend income on securities, FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks increased $5.6 million, or 601.6%, to $6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from $927,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

Net interest income increased $8.1 million, or 19.3%, to $50.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from $41.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily as a result of organic loan growth and a lower average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish the ALLL that, in management’s opinion, should be adequate to provide coverage for the inherent losses on outstanding loans. In evaluating the level of the ALLL, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. See Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —Allowance for Loan Losses” of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. After an evaluation of these factors, the Bank established a provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 of $11.4 million compared to $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The provision for loan losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was impacted by the change in qualitative factors during the period related to the microloans originated by Grain. The provision for loan losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily reflects the Bank’s assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on borrowers and their ability to repay in the short-term. Non-interest Income . Non-interest income decreased $6.0 million, or 64.8%, to $3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from $9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. 71 The following table presents non-interest income for the periods indicated: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Service charges and fees $ 1,349 $ 1,189 $ 160 13.5 % Brokerage commissions 461 217 244 — % Late and prepayment charges 360 871 (511 ) (58.7 %) Loss on sale of real property (436 ) 4,812 (5,248 ) (109.1 %) Other 1,504 2,104 (600 ) (28.5 %) Total non-interest income $ 3,238 $ 9,193 $ (5,955 ) (64.8 %) Non-interest Expense . Non-interest expense increased $22.6 million, or 69.1%, to $55.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from $32.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an aggregate $17.5 million write-off and write-down related to the Grain Receivable due from Grain for microloans originated by Grain and put back to Grain due to fraud, $1.0 write-off of the Company's investment in Grain, and an increase of $4.8 million in compensation and benefits related to nonrecurring expense amortization related to PPP loans and new hires. The following table presents non-interest expense for the periods indicated: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Compensation and benefits $ 16,012 $ 11,252 $ 4,760 42.3 % Occupancy and equipment 9,508 7,931 1,577 19.9 % Data processing expenses 2,615 2,226 389 17.5 % Direct loan expenses 1,659 1,495 164 11.0 % Insurance and surety bond premiums 562 435 127 29.2 % Office supplies, telephone and postage 1,033 1,186 (153 ) (12.9 %) Professional fees 2,782 4,670 (1,888 ) (40.4 %) Grain write-off and write-down 18,455 — 18,455 — % Marketing and promotional expenses 308 121 187 154.5 % Directors fees 256 205 51 24.9 % Regulatory assessment 253 254 (1 ) (0.4 %) Other operating expenses 1,915 2,967 (1,052 ) (35.5 %) Total non-interest expense $ 55,358 $ 32,742 $ 22,616 69.1 % Mortgage World Segment Net Income (Loss). Mortgage World’s net loss was ($2.5) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to net income of $207,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Non-interest Income . Non-interest income decreased $3.8 million, or 54.1%, to $3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from $7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily attributable to a decrease of $3.2 million in income on sale of mortgage loans. The following table presents non-interest income for the periods indicated: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Brokerage commissions $ 379 $ 706 $ (327 ) (46.3 %) Income on sale of mortgage loans 734 3,971 (3,237 ) (81.5 %) Loan origination 1,843 2,135 (292 ) (13.7 %) Other 296 269 27 10.0 % Total non-interest income $ 3,252 $ 7,081 $ (3,829 ) (54.1 %) 72 Non-interest Expense .

The most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of the Bank’s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of its financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. The Bank’s Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in the Bank’s assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given the business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with policies and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank currently utilizes a third-party modeling solution that is prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate its sensitivity to changing interest rates, given the Bank’s business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank does not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities. Mortgage World did not engage in hedging activities to cover the risks of interest rate movements while it held mortgages for sale. The then low mortgage interest rates and their limited volatility had effectively mitigated such risks. Net Interest Income Simulation Models . Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software that measures the Bank’s earnings through simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, the Bank has policy guidelines for earnings risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. As of September 30, 2022, in the event of an instantaneous upward and downward change in rates from management's interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated: Net Interest Income Year 1 Change Rate Shift (1) Year 1 Forecast from Level (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 82,254 2.02% +300 81,879 1.55% +200 81,490 1.07% +100 81,103 0.59% Level 80,626 — % -100 79,923 (0.87%) 73 Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The behavior of the deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in the projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the benefit in those scenarios. At September 30, 2022, the earnings simulation model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Economic Value of Equity Model . While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to net interest income, the Economic Value of Equity Model (“EVE”) measures estimated changes to the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. Rates are then shocked as prescribed by the Interest Rate Risk Policy to measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Interest Rate Risk Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At September 30, 2022, the EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: EVE as a Percentage of Present Value of Assets (3) Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Increase Change in Interest Estimated EVE EVE (Decrease) Rates (basis points) (1) EVE (2) Amount Percent Ratio (4) (basis points) (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 444,619 $ (100,777 ) (18.48 %) 23.16 % (1,848 ) +300 469,641 (75,755 ) (13.89 %) 23.83 % (1,389 ) +200 494,109 (51,287 ) (9.40 %) 24.42 % (940 ) +100 521,014 (24,382 ) (4.47 %) 25.08 % (447 ) Level 545,396 — — % 25.60 % — -100 569,935 24,539 4.50 % 26.07 % 450 Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2022, the EVE model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors’ approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Most Likely Earnings Simulation Models . Management also analyzes a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress the balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management and weighted to determine the most likely result. These processes assist management to better anticipate financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to review other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. 74 Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. The Asset/Liability Committee reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing and capital policies. Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in the Bank’s regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behaviors that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from the Bank’s historical studies of financial instruments and the best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into Bank’s asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare its results to other banks. The Asset/Liability Management Committee may determine that the Company should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and its conclusions regarding interest rate fluctuations in future periods. The historically low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response the turmoil resulting from COVID-19 pandemic is ending. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 3.75%-4.00% during its November 2022 meeting, the fifth consecutive rate hike, and pushing borrowing costs to the highest level since 2017. The Federal Reserve has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases at its next meeting in December 31, 2022. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. The Bank believes it is well positioned to withstand this rising interest rate environment in the near term as it is asset sensitive. GAP Analysis . In addition, management analyzes interest rate sensitivity by monitoring the Bank’s interest rate sensitivity ""gap."" The interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing-liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period, and a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period. The following table sets forth the Company’s interest-earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities at September 30, 2022, which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown based upon certain assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability.

Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and EVE tables presented assume that the composition of the interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income and EVE tables provide an indication of the interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and EVE and will differ from actual results. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. 76 In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table. Interest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of loans, deposits and borrowings. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity describes the ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Company’s customers and to fund current and future planned expenditures. The primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and available-for-sale securities and proceeds from the sale of loans. The Bank also has access to borrow from the FHLBNY. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bank had $286.4 million and $106.3 million, respectively, of term and overnight outstanding advances from the FHLBNY, and also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through letters of credit of up to $21.5 million, both as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there was eligible collateral of approximately $426.0 million and $362.3 million, respectively, in mortgage loans available to secure advances from the FHLBNY. The Bank also has an unsecured line of credit of $25.0 million with a correspondent bank, of which there was none outstanding at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Bank did not have any outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements with brokers as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, Mortgage World maintained two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans, with maximum credit lines of $30.0 million, of which $15.1 million was utilized, with $14.9 million remaining unused. As of September 30, 2022, Mortgage World was a division of the Bank and the Bank was funding these loans. Although maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The most liquid assets are cash and interest-bearing deposits in banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $14.2 million and $28.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations, purchases of new securities, and purchase of equipment offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed securities, and proceeds from the sale of real estate was ($641.1) million and ($230.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting of issuance of preferred stock, activities in deposit accounts, advances, contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation and repurchase and sale of shares as treasury stock, was $535.5 million and $193.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on the Company’s current assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and current global and regional market conditions on its borrowers, management has determined that these may be a detriment to borrowers’ ability to repay in the short-term and that the likelihood of long-term detrimental effects will depend significantly on the resolution of these factors and the resumption of normalized economic activities, a factor not yet determinable. The Bank’s management also took steps to enhance the Company’s liquidity position by increasing its on balance sheet cash and cash equivalents position in order to meet unforeseen liquidity events and to fund upcoming funding needs. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, all regulatory capital requirements were met, resulting in the Company and the Bank being categorized as well capitalized at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change this categorization. Material Cash Requirements Commitments . As a financial services provider, the Company routinely is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. Although these contractual obligations represent the Company’s future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans originated. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans and extend credit of $340.8 million and $220.5 million, respectively. It is anticipated that the Company will have sufficient funds available to meet its current lending commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from September 30, 2022 totaled $189.7 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing time deposits will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits are not retained, the Company may utilize FHLBNY advances, unsecured credit lines with correspondent banks, or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. 77 Contractual Obligations . In the ordinary course of its operations, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. There have been no material changes in the Company’s material cash requirements under its contractual obligations as discussed in its most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Other Material Cash Requirements. In addition to contractual obligations, the Company’s material cash requirements also includes compensation and benefits expenses for its employees, which were $21.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The Company also has material cash requirements for occupancy and equipment expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization of $1.4 million, related to rental expenses, general maintenance and cleaning supplies, guard services, software licenses and other miscellaneous expenses, which were $8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part I, Item 2 of this report under “Management of Market Risk”. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, there were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting. 78 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. The Company is not involved in any pending legal proceedings as a plaintiff or a defendant other than routine legal proceeding occurring in the ordinary course of business. At September 30, 2022, the Company was not involved in any legal proceedings the outcome of which management believes would be material to its financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Ris k Factors. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our 2021 Form 10-K and the risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our other SEC filings, which could materially affect our businesses, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our Risk Factors from those disclosed in Item 1A of our 2021 Form 10-K or our other SEC filings. The Company’s net income and earnings per share for the first quarter of 2022 have been adversely affected by a significant write-off and write-down related to its relationship with Grain Technologies, Inc. The Company’s results may be further adversely affected as a result of its lending relationship with Grain. As discussed under Item 2, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations‎, Factors Affecting the Comparability of Results, Write-off and Write-Down of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has taken a significant write-off and write-down related to microloans originated by FinTech startup company Grain as a result of cyber fraud in the application for microloans originated by Grain. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, if a microloan originated by Grain is found to be fraudulent, becomes 90 days delinquent upon 90 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of ‎Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been ‎complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The ‎microloans put back to Grain were accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.”‎ During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company has assessed ‎the collectability of the remaining Grain Receivable and has determined that it is appropriate to write-off the receivable in its entirety for a total write-off of $17.5 million - $8.1 million during the first quarter, $1.5 million during the second quarter and $7.9 million during the third quarter. Additionally, the Company has written-off its equity investment in Grain of $1.0 million. The Company continues to closely monitor its portfolio of consumer loans originated by Grain as well as Grain’s refinement of ‎solutions for detecting and preventing cyber fraud in the application for microloans. The Company has requested, and Grain has ‎agreed, that no new microloans be originated until further notice and that further extensions of credit to an existing microloan ‎borrower only be made upon confirmation that such borrower is not fraudulent. Further, like other start-up companies, there is a higher level ‎of risk that Grain may not be able to execute its business plan and may fail. In the event Grain were to cease operations, and ‎although it has considered contingency plans, the Bank may have greater difficulty in servicing and collecting the microloan ‎portfolio. In such a case, the level the Bank has provided for in its allowance for loan losses for its microloan portfolio may be ‎inadequate and it may need to increase its provision for loan losses, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. As a ‎consequence of such events the Bank may determine it appropriate to terminate its relationship with Grain. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities and Use of Proceeds. None Item 3.

Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Consolidation: Ponce Financial Group, Inc., as the successor by merger with PDL Community Bancorp pursuant to the completion of the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from the mutual holding company to the stock holding company form of organization that was effective on January 27, 2022 (hereafter referred to as “we,” “our,” “us,” “Ponce Financial Group, Inc.,” or the “Company”), is the holding company of Ponce Bank (“Ponce Bank” or the “Bank”), a federally chartered stock savings association. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary Ponce Bank (the “Bank”) and the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Ponce De Leon Mortgage Corp., which is a mortgage banking entity. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Nature of Operations: The Company is a savings and loan holding company. The Company is subject to the regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Company’s business is conducted through the administrative office and 13 full service banking and 4 mortgage loan offices. The banking offices are located in New York City – the Bronx ( 4 branches), Manhattan ( 2 branches), Queens ( 3 branches), Brooklyn ( 3 branches) and Union City ( 1 branch), New Jersey. The mortgage loan offices are located in Queens ( 2 ) and Brooklyn ( 1 ), New York and Bergenfield ( 1 ), New Jersey. The Company’s primary market area currently consists of the New York City metropolitan area. The Bank is a federally chartered stock savings association headquartered in the Bronx, New York. It was originally chartered in 1960 as a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association under the name Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1985, the Bank changed its name to “Ponce De Leon Federal Savings Bank.” In 1997, the Bank changed its name again to “Ponce De Leon Federal Bank.” Upon the completion of its reorganization into a mutual holding company structure in September of 2017, the assets and liabilities of Ponce De Leon Federal Bank were transferred to and assumed by the Bank. The Bank is a Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), a Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”), and a certified Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lender. The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). The Bank’s business primarily consists of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in mortgage loans, consisting of one-to-four family residential (both investor-owned and owner-occupied), multifamily residential, nonresidential properties and construction and land, and, to a lesser extent, in business and consumer loans. The Bank also invests in securities, which have historically consisted of U.S. government and federal agency securities and securities issued by government-sponsored or owned enterprises, mortgage-backed securities and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the “FHLBNY”) stock. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts, including demand, savings, money markets and certificates of deposit accounts. On July 10, 2020 , the Company completed its acquisition of Mortgage World Bankers, Inc. (“Mortgage World”). During the year ended December 31, 2021, Mortgage World was a mortgage banking entity subject to the regulation and examination of the New York State Department of Financial Services. The primary business of Mortgage World was the taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they were sold to investors. Although Mortgage World was permitted to do business in various states (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and Connecticut), it primarily operated in the New York City metropolitan area. On January 26, 2022, Mortgage World transferred its assets and liabilities to Ponce Bank and ceased operating as an independent mortgage banking entity. Mortgage World’s business is now conducted as a division of Ponce Bank. Risks and Uncertainties: On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched significant military action against Ukraine, and sustained conflict and disruption in the region is possible. The impact to Ukraine as well as actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions imposed by Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U.S. and other countries and companies and organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Russia, and actions taken by Russia in response to such sanctions, and each country’s potential response to such sanctions, tensions, and military actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 6 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic continues to disrupt the global and U.S. economies and as well as the lives of individuals throughout the world. The New York City Metropolitan area continues to experience, although to a much lesser extent, cases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the lessening of government regulatons related to COVID-19, it still impacts macroeconomic conditions. The financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely impact several industries within our geographic footprint and impair the ability of the Company’s customers to fulfill their contractual obligations to the Company. This could cause the Company to experience adverse effects on its business operations, loan portfolio, financial condition, and results of operations. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the provision for loan losses amounted to $ 2.1 million primarily due to increases in the loan portfolio and qualitative reserves as the Company continues to assess the economic impacts the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and increase in interest rates has on our local economy and our loan portfolio. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Use of Estimates : In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, the valuation of loans held for sale, the valuation of deferred tax assets and investment securities and the estimates relating to the valuation for share-based awards. Interim Financial Statements : The interim consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2022, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 are unaudited and reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2022, or any other period. Significant Group Concentrations of Credit Risk : Most of the Bank's activities are with customers located within New York City. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the Bank's loan portfolio and the ability of Mortgage World, a division of the Bank, to sell originated loans in the secondary markets are susceptible to changes in the local market conditions. Note 4 discusses the types of securities that the Bank invests in. Notes 5 and 12 discuss the types of lending that the Bank engages in, and other concentrations. Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts due from banks (including items in process of clearing). For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash flows from loans originated by the Company, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions, and deposits are reported net. Included in cash and cash equivalents are restricted cash from escrows and good faith deposits. Escrows consist of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) upfront mortgage insurance premiums and escrows on unsold mortgages that are held on behalf of borrowers. Good faith deposits consist of deposits received from commercial loan customers for use in various disbursements relating to the closing of a commercial loan. Restricted cash are included in cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows. Securities : Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the date individual investment securities are acquired, and the appropriateness of such classification is reassessed at each statement of financial condition date. Debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, if any, are classified as ""held-to-maturity"" and recorded at amortized cost. Trading securities, if any, are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings. Securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading, are classified as ""available-for-sale"" and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. 7 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: 1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and 2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. The credit loss is defined as the difference between the discounted present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. For equity securities, the entire amount of impairment is recognized through earnings. Gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific-identification method. The sale of a held-to-maturity security within three months of its maturity date or after collection of at least 85 % of the principal outstanding at the time the security was acquired is considered a maturity for purposes of classification and disclosure. Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock : The Bank is a member of the FHLBNY. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. FHLBNY stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. Loans Receivable : Loans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at current unpaid principal balances, net of the allowance for loan losses and including net deferred loan origination fees and costs. Interest income is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the interest method without anticipating prepayments. A loan is moved to nonaccrual status in accordance with the Company’s policy typically after 90 days of non-payment. The accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is generally discontinued at the time the loan becomes 90 days past due unless the loan is well-secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than 120 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All nonaccrual loans are considered impaired loans. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual are reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash basis or recorded against principal balances, until qualifying for return to accrual. Cash basis interest recognition is only applied on nonaccrual loans with a sufficient collateral margin to ensure no doubt with respect to the collectability of principal. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and remain current for a period of time (typically six months) and future payments are reasonably assured. Accrued interest receivable is closely monitored for collectability and will be charged-off in a timely manner if deemed uncollectable. Allowance for Loan Losses : The allowance for loan losses (“ALLL”) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged-off. The Company’s assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and interest rates on borrowers indicates that it is likely that it will be a detriment to their ability to repay in the short-term and that the likelihood of long-term detrimental effects depends significantly on the resumption of normalized economic activities, a factor not yet determinable. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. 8 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Impaired loans are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral, present value of cash flows, or the observable market price of the note. Impairment measurement for all collateral dependent loans, excluding accruing troubled debt restructurings, is based on the fair value of collateral, less costs to sell, if necessary. A loan is considered collateral dependent if repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the sale or the operation of the underlying collateral. When a loan is modified to troubled debt restructuring, management evaluates for any possible impairment using either the discounted cash flows method, where the value of the modified loan is based on the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, or by using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs, if repayment under the modified terms becomes doubtful. The general component covers non‑impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced over a rolling 12 quarter average period. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These economic factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and, effects of changes in credit concentrations. When establishing the allowance for loan losses, management categorizes loans into risk categories reflecting individual borrower earnings, liquidity, leverage and cash flow, as well as the nature of underlying collateral. These risk categories and relevant risk characteristics are as follows: Residential and Multifamily Mortgage Loans : Residential and multifamily mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages. These loans are typically underwritten with loan-to-value ratios ranging from 65 % to 90 %. The primary risks involved in residential mortgages are the borrower’s loss of employment, or other significant event, that negatively impacts the source of repayment. Additionally, a serious decline in home values could jeopardize repayment in the event that the underlying collateral needs to be liquidated to pay-off the loan. Nonresidential Mortgage Loans : Nonresidential mortgage loans are primarily secured by commercial buildings, office and industrial buildings, warehouses, small retail shopping centers and various special purpose properties, including hotels, restaurants and nursing homes. These loans are typically underwritten at no more than 75 % loan-to-value ratio. Although terms vary, commercial real estate loans generally have amortization periods of 15 to 30 years , as well as balloon payments of 10 to 15 years , and terms which provide that the interest rates are adjusted on a 5 -year schedule. Construction and Land Loans : Construction real estate loans consist of vacant land and property that is in the process of improvement. Repayment of these loans can be dependent on the sale of the property to third parties or the successful completion of the improvements by the builder for the end user. In the event a loan is made on property that is not yet improved for the planned development, there is the risk that government approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Construction loans also run the risk that improvements will not be completed on time or in accordance with specifications and projected costs. Construction real estate loans generally have terms of six months to two years during the construction period with fixed rates or interest rates based on a designated index. Business Loans : Business loans are loans for commercial, corporate and business purposes, including issuing letters of credit. These loans are secured by business assets or may be unsecured and repayment is directly dependent on the successful operation of the borrower’s business and the borrower’s ability to convert the assets to operating revenue. They possess greater risk than most other types of loans because the repayment capacity of the borrower may become inadequate. Business loans generally have terms of five to seven years or less and interest rates that float in accordance with a designated published index. Substantially, all such loans are backed by the personal guarantees of the owners of the business. Consumer Loans : Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates than mortgage loans. The risk involved in consumer loans is the type and nature of the collateral and, in certain cases, the absence of collateral. Consumer loans include passbook loans and other secured and unsecured loans that have been made for a variety of consumer purposes. Included in consumer loans are loans related to Grain. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value : Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, include residential mortgages that were originated in accordance with secondary market pricing and underwriting standards. These loans are loans originated by the Bank’s Mortgage World division and the Company intends to sell these loans on the secondary market. Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. The gains or losses for the changes in fair value of these loans are included in income on sale of mortgage loans on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale measured under the fair value option is calculated based on the principal amount of the loan and is included in interest loans receivable on the consolidated statements of operations . Derivative Financial Instruments : The Company, through the Bank’s Mortgage World division, uses derivative financial instruments as a part of its price risk management activities. All such derivative financial instruments are designated as free-standing derivative instruments. In accordance with FASB ASC 815-25, Derivatives and Hedging , all derivative instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their fair value. Change in the fair value of these derivatives is reported in current period earnings. 9 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Additionally, to facilitate the sale of mortgage loans, the Bank, through its Mortgage World division, may enter into forward sale positions on securities, and mandatory delivery positions. Exposure to losses or gains on these positions is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid. As of June 30, 2022, the Company did not enter into any forward sale or mandatory delivery positions on their financial instruments. Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The Company’s revenue from contracts with customers in the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contract with Customers , is recognized within noninterest income. ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Management determined the revenue streams impacted by ASC 606 included those related to service charges on deposit accounts, ATM and card fees and other services fees. The Company’s revenue recognition pattern for these revenue streams did not change from current practice. The Company's primary sources of revenue are interest income on financial assets and income from mortgage banking activities, which are explicitly excluded from the scope of ASC 606. COVID-19 Pandemic and the CARES Act: On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law. Section 4013 of the CARES Act, “Temporary Relief from Troubled Debt Restructurings,” provides banks the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings (“TDR”) for a limited period of time to account for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, on April 7, 2020, the banking agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, issued a statement, “Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working With Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised)” (“Interagency Statement”), to encourage banks to work prudently with borrowers and to describe the agencies’ interpretation of how accounting rules under ASC 310-40, “Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors,” apply to certain of the COVID-19 pandemic related modifications. Further, on August 3, 2020, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council issued a Joint Statement on Additional Loan Accommodations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, to provide prudent risk management and consumer protection principles for financial institutions to consider while working with borrowers as loans near the end of initial loan accommodation periods. Under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, modifications of loan terms do not automatically result in TDRs and the Company generally does not need to categorize the COVID-19 pandemic-related modifications as TDRs. The Company may elect not to categorize loan modifications as TDRs if they are (1) related to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (A) 60 days after the date of termination of the National Emergency or (B) December 31, 2020. This relief was extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act enacted on December 27, 2020 to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the termination of the national emergency. This relief was not extended beyond January 1, 2022 and the Bank has made appropriate adjustments which are not material. Federal banking agencies were required to defer to the determination of the banks making such election. This includes short-term (e.g., six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. Borrowers considered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented. Financial institutions accounting for eligible loans under Section 4013 are not required to apply ASC Subtopic 310-40 to the Section 4013 loans for the term of the loan modification. Financial institutions do not have to report Section 4013 loans as TDRs in regulatory reports, including this Form 10-Q for periods prior to the expiration date. Transfers of Financial Assets : Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when all of the components meet the definition of a participating interest and when control over the assets has been surrendered. A participating interest generally represents (1) a proportionate (pro rata) ownership interest in an entire financial asset, (2) a relationship where from the date of transfer all cash flows received from the entire financial asset are divided proportionately among the participating interest holders in an amount equal to their share of ownership, (3) the priority of cash flows has certain characteristics, including no reduction in priority, subordination of interest, or recourse to the transferor other than standard representation or warranties, and (4) no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Bank, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Bank does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either (a) an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity or (b) the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a clean-up call. 10 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Premises and Equipment : Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed and charged to operations using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows: Years Buildings 39 Building improvements 15 - 39 Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 3 - 10 Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated economic lives or the related lease terms, including extensions expected to be exercised. Gains and losses on dispositions are recognized upon realization. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and improvements are capitalized. Leasehold improvements in process are not amortized until the assets are placed in operation. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets : Long-lived assets, including premises and leasehold improvements, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated by that review, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to noninterest expense. Other Real Estate Owned : Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) represents properties acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure or other proceedings. OREO is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated disposal costs, at the date of foreclosure, which establishes a new cost basis. After foreclosure, the properties are held for sale and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs of disposal. Any write-down to fair value, at the time of transfer to OREO, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Properties are evaluated regularly to ensure that the recorded amounts are supported by current fair values and charges against earnings are recorded as necessary to reduce the carrying amount to fair value, less estimated costs to dispose. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property are capitalized, subject to the limit of fair value of the OREO, while costs relating to holding the property are expensed. Gains or losses are included in operations upon disposal. Income Taxes : The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income, in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 % likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, would be classified as additional provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. Related Party Transactions : Directors and officers of the Company and their affiliates have been customers of and have had transactions with the Company, and it is expected that such persons will continue to have such transactions in the future. Management believes that all deposit accounts, loans, services and commitments comprising such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other customers who are not directors or officers. In the opinion of management, the transactions with related parties did not involve more than normal risk of collectability, nor favored treatment or terms, nor present other unfavorable features. Note 16 contains details regarding related party transactions. 11 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans: The Company maintains a KSOP, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) provisions incorporated, a Long-Term Incentive Plan that includes grants of restricted stock units and stock options, and a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”). KSOP, the Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions: Compensation expense is recorded as shares are committed to be released with a corresponding credit to unearned KSOP equity account at the average fair market value of the shares during the period and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the service period based upon management’s estimate of the number of shares expected to be allocated by the KSOP. The difference between the average fair market value and the cost of the shares allocated by the KSOP is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in-capital. Unallocated common shares held by the Company’s KSOP are shown as a reduction in stockholders’ equity and are excluded from weighted-average common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted earnings per share calculations until they are committed to be released. The 401(k) provisions provide for elective employee/participant deferrals of income. Discretionary matching, profit-sharing, and safe harbor contributions, not to exceed 4 % of employee compensation and profit-sharing contributions may be provided. Stock Options: The Company recognizes the value of shared-based payment transactions as compensation costs in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. The fair value of the share-based payments for stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur during the period. Restricted Stock Units: The Company recognizes compensation cost related to restricted stock units based on the market price of the stock units at the grant date over the vesting period. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determines the fair value of restricted stock units. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Comprehensive Income (Loss): Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss), which are both recognized as separate components of stockholder’s equity. Other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale. Loss Contingencies : Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are any such matters that will have a material effect on the operations and financial position of the Company. Fair Value of Financial Instruments : Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in Note 13. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates. Segment Reporting : The Company has two reportable segments: the Bank and, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, Mortgage World, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, Mortgage World as a division of the Bank. Income from the Bank consists primarily of interest and fees earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts. Income from Mortgage World consists primarily of taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they are sold to investors. Loan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments : Financial instruments include off‑balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. Earnings (Loss) per Share (“EPS”) : Basic EPS represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding, plus the effect of potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Basic weighted common shares outstanding is weighted average common shares outstanding less weighted average unallocated ESOP shares. Treasury Stock : Shares repurchased under the Company’s share repurchase programs were purchased in open-market transactions and are held as treasury stock. The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of stockholders’ equity. 12 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements: As an emerging growth company (“EGC”) as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, the Company has elected to use the extended transition period to delay the adoption of new or reissued accounting pronouncements applicable to public business entities until such pronouncements are made applicable to nonpublic business entities. The Company will be exiting the EGC status as of December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2022, there is no significant difference in the comparability of the consolidated financial statements as a result of this extended transition period. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” This ASU requires all lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset, measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, at the lease commencement date. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged under the new guidance. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, for public business entities. As the Company is taking advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards assuming it remains an EGC, it will adopt the amendments in this update for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company has begun its evaluation of the amended guidance including the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. To date, the Company has identified its leased office spaces as within the scope of the guidance. The Company currently leases its administrative office and 16 branches and mortgage offices and the new guidance will result in the establishment of a right to use asset and corresponding lease obligations. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance, including determining whether other contracts exist that are deemed to be in scope and subsequent related accounting standard updates. The Company has established a project committee and has initiated training on ASU 2016-02. The Company is performing preliminary computations of its right to use asset and corresponding lease obligations for the operating leases of its administrative office and 16 leased branches and mortgage offices. The Company is utilizing a new lease accounting tool to assist in the computations of its right to use asset and corresponding lease obligations for the operating leases. The Company will adopt this standard at the end of December 2022 and anticipates recognizing approximately $ 34.3 million of right of use asset and approximately $ 35.5 million of operating lease liability. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “ Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This ASU significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The standard is to replace today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model. The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model, is to apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments and financial guarantees. The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities. For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. As a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time, as they do today. The ASU also reportedly simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt, securities and loans. ASU 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity’s assumptions, models and methods for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, entities will need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, for public business entities, that are not deemed to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC as of November 15, 2019. As the Company is taking advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards assuming it remains an EGC, it will adopt the amendments in this update for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities have to apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach). Although early adoption is permitted, the Company does not expect to elect that option. The Company has begun its evaluation of the amended guidance including the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. As a result of the required change in approach toward determining estimated credit losses from the current “incurred loss” model to one based on estimated cash flows over a loan’s contractual life, adjusted for prepayments (a “life of loan” model), the Company expects that the new guidance will result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses, particularly for longer duration loan portfolios. The Company also notes that the new guidance may result in an allowance for available-for-sale debt securities. The Company has selected the CECL model and has begun running scenarios. In both cases, the extent of the change is indeterminable at this time as it will be dependent upon portfolio composition and credit quality at the adoption date, as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. 13 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) . ” This ASU provides optional means and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or other reference rates expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company believes this update will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2. Preferred Stock Issuance; Plan of Conversion and Stock Offering Preferred Stock Issuance On June 7, 2022, the Company‎ closed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 225,000 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A‎, par value $ 0.01 (the “Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price equal to $ 225,000,000 in cash, to the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) pursuant to the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”).‎ The holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a dividend payable in cash quarterly at an annual rate dependent on certain factors as reported by the Company to Treasury in a quarterly supplemental report. The initial dividend rate is zero percent for the first two years after issuance, and thereafter the floor dividend rate is 0.50 % and the ceiling dividend rate is 2.00 %. The actual dividend rate that will be paid by the Company on the Preferred Stock cannot be determined at this time. The ECIP investment by the Treasury is part of a program to invest over $ 8.7 billion into Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) or ‎Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), of which Ponce Bank is both. The ECIP is intended to incentivize CDFIs and MDIs to provide loans, grants, ‎and forbearance to small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers in low-income and underserved communities that may have been ‎disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.‎ In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $ 1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. Plan of Conversion and Common Stock Offering On May 25 , 2021, Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company and PDL Community Bancorp, the then holding company for Ponce Bank and Mortgage World Bankers, Inc., announced that their Boards of Directors had unanimously adopted a Plan of Conversion and Reorganization (the “Plan”) pursuant to which Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company and PDL Community Bancorp reorganized into a new stock holding company and conducted a second-step stock offering of new shares of common stock . On January 26, 2022, Mortgage World transferred its assets and liabilities to Ponce Bank and ceased operating as an independent mortgage banking entity. Mortgage World’s business is now conducted as a division of Ponce Bank. On January 27, 2022, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and PDL Community Bancorp announced that the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from the mutual to stock form of organization and related stock offering was consummated at the close of business. As a result of the closing of the conversion and reorganization and stock offering, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. is now the holding company for Ponce Bank. Ponce Bank’s former mutual holding companies, PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, have ceased to exist. PDL Community Bancorp’s stock ceased trading at the close of the market on January 27, 2022. Ponce Financial Group, Inc.’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the same trading symbol “PDLB” on January 28, 2022. As a result of the conversion and reorganization, each issued and outstanding share of PDL Community Bancorp common stock was converted into the right to receive 1.3952 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. Cash was paid in lieu of any fractional shares based on the sale price in the offering of $ 10.00 per share. Ponce Financial Group Inc.’s total issued and outstanding shares on January 28, 2022 was 24,711,834 shares. All shares of treasury stock of PDL Community Bancorp were eliminated on January 27, 2022. At December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents included $ 122.0 million received in connection with the conversion and reorganization and was reflected as a separate liability on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. As of January 27, 2022, these funds were reclassified as proceeds from the sale of the Company’s common stock. 14 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 2. Preferred Stock Issuance; Plan of Conversion and Stock Offering (continued) On January 27, 2022, the Company made a $ 5.0 million in contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation as part of the conversion and reorganization, which is included in the non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Note 3 . Restrictions on Cash and Due from Banks The Bank was previously required to maintain reserve balances in cash or on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank, based on a percentage of deposits. Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board eliminated reserve requirement for depository institutions to support lending to households and businesses. Note 4 .

Securities (Continued) At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had 41 and 23 available-for-sale securities, respectively , and eight and one held-to-maturity securities at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 with gross unrealized loss positions. Management reviewed the financial condition of the entities underlying the securities at both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and determined that they are not other than temporarily impaired because the unrealized losses in those securities relate to market interest rate changes. The Company has the ability to hold them and does not have the intent to sell these securities, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities, before recovery of the cost basis. In addition, management also considers the issuers of the securities to be financially sound and believes the Company will receive all contractual principal and interest related to these investments. The following is a summary of maturities of securities at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Amounts are shown by contractual maturity. Because borrowers for mortgage-backed securities have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties, at any time, these securities are included as a total within the table.

(2) As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, consumer loans include $ 28.3 million and $ 33.9 million, respectively, of microloans originated by the Bank through a mobile application of Grain Technologies, LLC (“Grain”) that is geared to the underbanked and new generations entering the financial services market and uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies . The Company’s lending activities are conducted principally in metropolitan New York City. The Company primarily grants loans secured by real estate to individuals and businesses pursuant to an established credit policy applicable to each type of lending activity in which it engages. Although collateral provides assurance as a secondary source of repayment, the Company ordinarily requires the primary source of repayment to be based on the borrowers’ ability to generate continuing cash flows. The Company also evaluates the collateral and creditworthiness of each customer. The credit policy provides that depending on the borrowers’ creditworthiness and type of collateral, credit may be extended up to predetermined percentages of the market value of the collateral or on an unsecured basis. Real estate is the primary form of collateral. Other important forms of collateral are time deposits and marketable securities. For disclosures related to the allowance for loan losses and credit quality, the Company does not have any disaggregated classes of loans below the segment level. Credit-Quality Indicators : Internally assigned risk ratings are used as credit-quality indicators, which are reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. The objectives of the Company’s risk-rating system are to provide the Board of Directors and senior management with an objective assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio, to promptly and accurately identify loans with well-defined credit weaknesses so that timely action can be taken to minimize credit loss, to identify relevant trends affecting the collectability of the loan portfolio, to isolate potential problem areas and to provide essential information for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. 20 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 5. Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses (Continued) Below are the definitions of the internally assigned risk ratings: • Strong Pass – Loans to a new or existing borrower collateralized at least 90 percent by an unimpaired deposit account at the Company. • Good Pass – Loans to a new or existing borrower in a well-established enterprise in excellent financial condition with strong liquidity and a history of consistently high level of earnings, cash flow and debt service capacity. • Satisfactory Pass – Loans to a new or existing borrower of average strength with acceptable financial condition, satisfactory record of earnings and sufficient historical and projected cash flow to service the debt. • Performance Pass – Existing loans that evidence strong payment history but document less than average strength, financial condition, record of earnings, or projected cash flows with which to service the debt. • Special Mention – Loans in this category are currently protected but show one or more potential weaknesses and risks which may inadequately protect collectability or borrower’s ability to meet repayment terms at some future date if the weakness or weaknesses are not monitored or remediated. • Substandard – Loans that are inadequately protected by the repayment capacity of the borrower or the current sound net worth of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans in this category have well defined weaknesses and risks that jeopardize the repayment. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss may be sustained if the deficiencies are not remediated. • Doubtful – Loans that have all the weaknesses of loans classified as “Substandard” with the added characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans within the top four categories above are considered pass rated, as commonly defined. Risk ratings are assigned as necessary to differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised to reflect changes in the borrowers’ financial condition and outlook, debt service coverage capability, repayment performance, collateral value and coverage as well as other considerations. The following tables present credit risk ratings by loan segment as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021: June 30, 2022 Mortgage Loans Nonmortgage Loans Construction Total 1-4 Family Multifamily Nonresidential and Land Business Consumer Loans (in thousands) Risk Rating: Pass $ 406,439 $ 391,632 $ 277,623 $ 154,608 $ 45,720 $ 30,198 $ 1,306,220 Special mention 5,676 4,150 — — — — 9,826 Substandard 9,604 688 2,254 10,817 — — 23,363 Total $ 421,719 $ 396,470 $ 279,877 $ 165,425 $ 45,720 $ 30,198 $ 1,339,409 December 31, 2021 Mortgage Loans Nonmortgage Loans Construction Total 1-4 Family Multifamily Nonresidential and Land Business Consumer Loans (in thousands) Risk Rating: Pass $ 402,276 $ 339,047 $ 237,371 $ 127,084 $ 150,512 $ 34,693 $ 1,290,983 Special mention 1,820 5,328 — 6,650 — — 13,798 Substandard 10,155 3,925 2,320 917 — — 17,317 Total $ 414,251 $ 348,300 $ 239,691 $ 134,651 $ 150,512 $ 34,693 $ 1,322,098 21 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 5.

Any loan that is, or will potentially be, no longer performing in accordance with the terms of the original loan contract is evaluated to determine impairment. 25 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 5 .

Under applicable standards, loans are modified to troubled debt restructurings when a creditor, for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor’s financial condition, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider, unless it results in a delay in payment that is insignificant. These concessions could include a reduction of interest rate on the loan, payment and maturity extensions, forbearance, or other actions intended to maximize collections. When a loan is modified to a troubled debt restructuring, management evaluates for any possible impairment using either the discounted cash flows method, where the value of the modified loan is based on the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, or by using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs if repayment under the modified terms becomes doubtful. If management determines that the value of the modified loan in a troubled debt restructuring is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized through a specific allowance estimate or charge-off against the allowance for loan losses. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, and for the year ended December 31, 2021, there were no loans restructured as a troubled debt restructuring. At June 30, 2022, there were 25 troubled debt restructured loans totaling $ 7.1 million of which $ 5.0 million are on accrual status. At December 31, 2021, there were 30 troubled debt restructured loans totaling $ 8.7 million of which $ 6.2 million are on accrual status. There were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. The financial impact from the concessions made represents specific impairment reserves on these loans, which aggregated to $ 223,000 and $ 243,000 at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale at Fair Value At June 30, 2022 and at December 31, 2021, 17 loans and 27 loans related to Mortgage World in the amount of $ 9.2 million and $ 15.5 million, respectively, were held for sale and accounted for under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. Write-off and write-down of Microloans In 2020, the Company entered in a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain. Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to $ 1,000 and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originates and services these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan is found to be fraudulent, becomes 120 days delinquent upon 120 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.” The Bank, pursuant to its agreement with Grain, at December 31, 2021, had 59,180 microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with credit extensions aggregating $ 33.9 million. Of these microloans, the Bank estimates that 80 percent have been made in low- and low-to-moderate income census tracts with an estimated 56 percent made to minority borrowers. At June 30, 2022, the Bank had 43,073 microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $ 28.3 million and which were performing, in management’s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by a $ 1.4 million allowance for loan losses, resulting in $ 26.9 million in microloans, net of allowance for loan losses. Since the beginning of the Bank’s agreement with Grain and through June 30, 2022, 29,592 microloans amounting to $ 20.4 million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain. The Company has written-down a total of $ 9.6 million of the Grain Receivable for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and received $ 6.0 million in cash from Grain and through the application of security deposits connected to fraudulent loan accounts. The Bank also opted to use the $ 1.8 million grant it received from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Rapid Response ‎Program to defray the Grain Receivable. The application of those amounts resulted in a net receivable of $ 3.0 million. As of June 30, 2022, the Company’s total exposure to Grain was $ 30.9 million as a result of the $ 3.0 million of net receivable, $ 26.9 million of the remaining microloans, net of allowance for loan losses and an equity investment in Grain by the Company of $ 1.0 million. 27 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 5. Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses (Continued) The $ 1.5 million and $ 9.6 million write-off and write-down is included in non-interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Note 6. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are summarized as follows: June 30, December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Land $ 932 $ 932 Buildings and improvements 4,327 4,327 Leasehold improvements 15,992 16,462 Furniture, fixtures and equipment 9,706 9,661 30,957 31,382 Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 12,012 ) ( 11,765 ) Total premises and equipment $ 18,945 $ 19,617 Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $ 466,000 and $ 636,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 and $ 933,000 and $ 1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included in occupancy and equipment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Compared to December 31, 2021, leasehold improvements decreased by $ 470,000 to $ 16.0 million primarily as a result of assets disposal. Furniture, fixtures and equipment increased by $ 45,000 to $ 9.7 million primarily as a result of $ 235,000 in purchases offset by $ 190,000 in write-offs of obsolete software. Note 7 .

Note 8 . Borrowings FHLBNY Advances : As a member of the FHLBNY, the Bank has the ability to borrow from the FHLBNY based on a certain percentage of the value of the Bank's qualified collateral, as defined in the FHLBNY Statement of Credit Policy, at the time of the borrowing. In accordance with an agreement with the FHLBNY, the qualified collateral must be free and clear of liens, pledges and encumbrances. The Bank had $ 159.4 million and $ 106.3 million of outstanding term advances from the FHLBNY at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively and $ 175.0 million of overnight line of credit advance from the FHLBNY at June 30, 2022. The bank had no overnight line of credit advance from the FHLBNY at December 31, 2021. The Bank repaid $ 47.9 million in advances from FHLBNY during the six months ended June 30, 2022. Additionally, the Bank had an unsecured line of credit in the amount of $ 25.0 million with a correspondent bank at both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, no ne of which was outstanding as of such dates. The Bank also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through letters of credit of up to $ 21.5 million each at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Borrowed funds at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 consist of the following and are summarized by maturity and call date below: June 30, December 31, 2022 2021 Scheduled Maturity Redeemable at Call Date Weighted Average Rate Scheduled Maturity Redeemable at Call Date Weighted Average Rate (Dollars in thousands) FHLBNY Overnight line of credit advance $ 175,000 $ 175,000 1.82 % $ — $ — — % FHLBNY Term advances ending: 2022 $ 131,000 $ 131,000 1.77 % $ 77,880 $ 77,880 1.73 % 2023 28,375 28,375 2.82 28,375 28,375 2.82 $ 334,375 $ 334,375 1.88 % $ 106,255 $ 106,255 2.02 % Interest expense on FHLBNY term advances totaled $ 477,000 and $ 544,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, and $ 1.0 million and $ 1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were no interest expense on FHLBNY overnight advances for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022.

Warehouse Lines of Credit: Mortgage World maintained two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the originations and sale of residential mortgages. The lines of credit were repaid with proceeds from the sale of the mortgage loans. The lines were secured by the assets collateralizing underlying mortgages. The agreements with the warehouse lenders provided for certain restrictive covenants such as minimum net worth and liquidity ratios for Mortgage World. As of December 31, 2021, Mortgage World was in full compliance with all financial covenants. 29 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 8. Borrowings (Continued) Warehouse Line of Credit #1 The interest rate is based on the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 3.25 %. The effective rate as of June 30, 2022 was 5.54 % and the effective rate as of December 31, 2021 was 3.35 %. The line of credit is an evergreen agreement that terminates upon request by either the financial institution or the borrower. Warehouse Line of Credit #2 The interest rate is based on the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 3.00 % for loans funded. The effective rate as of December 31, 2021 was 3.10 %. This warehouse line of credit was terminated on March 31, 2022 . Total interest expense on warehouse lines of credit totaled $ 4,000 and $ 72,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, and $ 70,000 and $ 212,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

This liability is presented at cost and fully offsets the principal balance of the related loans included in mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value on the consolidated statement of financial condition. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were no mortgage loan funding payable for both periods. Note 9 . Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 consists of the following: For the Three Months Ended June 30, For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (in thousands) Federal: Current $ ( 842 ) $ 2,496 $ ( 1,895 ) $ 3,056 Deferred 418 ( 969 ) ( 1,297 ) ( 933 ) ( 424 ) 1,527 ( 3,192 ) 2,123 State and local: Current 378 323 573 391 Deferred ( 1,981 ) 391 ( 2,524 ) 701 ( 1,603 ) 714 ( 1,951 ) 1,092 Valuation allowance 1,539 ( 327 ) 1,707 ( 569 ) (Benefit) provision for income taxes $ ( 488 ) $ 1,914 $ ( 3,436 ) $ 2,646 30 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 9. Income Taxes (Continued) Total income tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21 % for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to income before income taxes as a result of the following: For the Three Months Ended June 30, For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (in thousands) Income tax, at federal rate $ 59 $ 1,646 $ ( 1,992 ) $ 2,316 State and local tax, net of federal taxes ( 1,266 ) 564 ( 1,541 ) 863 Valuation allowance, net of the federal benefit 1,539 ( 327 ) 1,707 ( 569 ) Other ( 820 ) 31 ( 1,610 ) 36 $ ( 488 ) $ 1,914 $ ( 3,436 ) $ 2,646 Management maintains a valuation allowance against its net New York State and New York City deferred tax assets as it is unlikely these deferred tax assets will be utilized to reduce the Company's tax liability in future years. The valuation allowance increased by $ 1.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and decreased by $ 569,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Management has determined that it is not required to establish a valuation allowance against any other deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully utilized in future periods. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers the scheduled reversal of the deferred tax liabilities, the level of historical taxable income, and the projected future taxable income over the periods that the temporary differences comprising the deferred tax assets will be deductible. For federal income tax purposes, a financial institution may carry net operating losses (“NOLs”) to forward tax years indefinitely. The use of NOLs to offset income is limited to 80 %. The CARES Act allows NOLs generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding tax years. The Company did not generate NOLs in 2018, 2019 or 2020 so no carryback is available. At June 30, 2022, the Bank had a federal NOLs carryforward of $ 4.9 million. The state and city of New York allow for a three-year carryback period and carryforward period of twenty years on NOLs generated on or after tax year 2015. For tax years prior to 2015, no carryback period is allowed. Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, has pre-2015 carryforwards of $ 572,000 for New York State purposes and $ 528,000 for New York City purposes. Furthermore, there are post-2015 carryforwards available of $ 48.3 million for New York State purposes and $ 23.7 million for New York City purposes. Finally, for New Jersey purposes, losses may only be carried forward 20 years, with no allowable carryback period. At June 30, 2022, the Bank had a New Jersey NOLs carryforward of $ 294,000 . At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits recorded. The Company does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase in the next twelve months. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax, New York State income tax, Connecticut income tax, New Jersey income tax, Florida income tax, Pennsylvania income tax and New York City income tax. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2018. 31 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 9. Income Taxes (Continued) The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are presented below: June 30, December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan losses $ 5,634 $ 5,254 Deferred loan fees — 214 Interest on nonaccrual loans 238 102 Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities 4,122 399 Amortization of intangible assets 41 50 Deferred rent payable 208 152 Net operating losses 5,870 3,280 Charitable contribution carryforward 1,658 366 Compensation and benefits 890 456 Other 207 264 Total gross deferred tax assets 18,868 10,537 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation of premises and equipment 1,301 1,301 Deferred loan fees 786 — Other 63 63 Total gross deferred tax liabilities 2,150 1,364 Valuation allowance 7,060 5,353 Net deferred tax assets $ 9,658 $ 3,820 Note 10 . Compensation and Benefit Plans Ponce Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions (the “KSOP”) . Effective January 1, 2021, Ponce Bank amended and restated the terms of the Ponce Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “ESOP”) and merged the Ponce Bank 401(k) Plan into the ESOP to form the KSOP. There were no changes to the provisions of the ESOP as discussed below. The KSOP is for eligible employees of Ponce Bank and those of its affiliates. The named executive officers are eligible to participate in the KSOP just like other employees. An employee must attain the age of 21 and will be eligible to participate in the 401(k) features of the KSOP in the quarter following thirty days of service and the ESOP feature of the KSOP upon the first entry date commencing on or after the eligible employee’s completion of one year of service. Employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan at the beginning of each quarter (January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1). 401(k) Component : Under the 401(k) features of the KSOP (“401(k) Component”), a participant may elect to defer, on a pre-tax basis, the maximum amount as permitted by the Internal Revenue Code. For 2022, the salary deferral contribution limit was $ 20,500 ; provided, however, that a participant over age 50 may contribute an additional $ 6,500 to the 401(k) for a total of $ 27,000 . In addition to salary deferral contributions, Ponce Bank may make discretionary matching contributions, discretionary profit sharing contributions or safe harbor contributions to the 401(k) Component. Discretionary matching contributions are allocated on the basis of salary deferral contributions. Discretionary profit sharing contributions are based on three classifications set forth in the 401(k) feature (i) Class A — Chairman, President, and Executive Vice Presidents; (ii) Class B — Senior Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents and Assistant Vice Presidents; and (iii) Class C — all other eligible employees. The contribution for a class will be the same percentage of compensation for all participants in that class. If Ponce Bank decides to make a safe harbor contribution for a plan year, each participant will receive a contribution equal to 3 % of his or her compensation for the plan year. The 401(k) expenses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations amounted to $ 96,000 for both the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 and $ 192,000 and $ 183,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 32 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 10. Compensation and Benefit Plans (Continued) A participant is always 100 % vested in his or her salary deferral contributions and safe harbor contributions. Discretionary matching and profit sharing contributions are 20 % vested after two years of service, plus an additional 20 % for each additional year of service; so all participants are fully vested in such contributions after six years of service. Participants also will become fully vested in his or her account balance in the 401(k) Component automatically upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the KSOP. Generally, participants will receive distributions from the KSOP upon separation from service in accordance with the terms of the governing document. ESOP Component: On September 29, 2017, in connection with the Bank’s reorganization into the mutual holding company form of organization, the ESOP trustee purchased, on behalf of the ESOP, 723,751 shares of PDL Community Bancorp common stock . The ESOP funded its stock purchase with a loan (“First ESOP loan”) from PDL Community Bancorp in the amount of $ 7.2 million, which was equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The First ESOP loan is being repaid principally through Ponce Bank’s contributions to the ESOP over the 15 -year term of such loan. The interest rate for the First ESOP loan is 2.60 %. On January 27, 2022, concurrent with the completion of the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from a mutual form to a stock form of organization and the merger of PDL Community Bancorp with and into Ponce Financial Group, Inc., the shares of PDL Community Bancorp common stock held by the KSOP were converted into 977,880 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. On January 27, 2022, the KSOP trustee purchased, on behalf of the ESOP feature of the KSOP (“ESOP Component”), an additional 1,097,353 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock, or 4.44 % of the total number of shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock outstanding on January 27, 2022 (including shares issued to the Foundation). The KSOP funded this stock purchase with a loan (“Second ESOP loan”) from Ponce Financial Group, Inc. in the amount of $ 11.0 million, which was equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The Second ESOP loan is being repaid principally through Ponce Bank’s contributions to the ESOP Component over the 15 -year term of such loan. The interest rate for the Second ESOP loan is 1.822 %. The trustee of the trust funding the KSOP holds the shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock purchased by the KSOP in an unallocated suspense account, and shares will be released from the suspense account on a pro-rata basis as the loans are repaid. The trustee will allocate the shares released among participants on the basis of each participant’s proportional share of qualifying compensation relative to all participants participating in the ESOP Component. A participant will become 100 % vested in his or her account balance in the ESOP Component after three years of service. In addition, p articipants will become fully vested in his or her account balance in the ESOP Component automatically upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the KSOP. Generally, participants will receive distributions from the KSOP upon separation from service in accordance with the terms of the plan document. The KSOP reallocates any unvested shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock forfeited upon termination of employment among the remaining participants in the ESOP Component. Contributions to the ESOP are to be sufficient to pay principal and interest currently due under the loan agreement. Under applicable accounting requirements, Ponce Bank will record a compensation expense for the ESOP at the average market price of the shares as they are committed to be released from the unallocated suspense account to participants’ accounts, which may be more or less than the original issue price. The compensation expense resulting from the release of the common stock from the suspense account and allocation to plan participants will result in a corresponding reduction in the earnings of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. T he ESOP shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations (see Note 11). As of June 30, 2022, the combined outstanding balance of both the First ESOP loan and Second ESOP loan was $ 14.7 million . 33 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 10. Compensation and Benefit Plans (Continued) A summary of the ESOP shares as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows: June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Shares committed-to-be released 70,238 96,500 Shares allocated to participants 368,960 170,145 Unallocated shares 1,632,982 434,251 Total 2,072,180 700,896 Fair value of unallocated shares $ 15,089 $ 6,297 The Company recognized ESOP related compensation expense, including ESOP equalization expense, of $ 333,000 and $ 173,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, and $ 706,000 and $ 330,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan: The Bank maintains a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) for the benefit of two key executive officers. The SERP expense recognized was $ 15,000 for both the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 and was $ 30,000 for both the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. 2018 Incentive Plan The Company’s stockholders approved the PDL Community Bancorp 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2018 Incentive Plan”) at the Special Meeting of Stockholders on October 30, 2018. The maximum number of shares of common stock which can be issued under the 2018 Incentive Plan is 1,248,469 . Of the 1,248,469 shares, the maximum number of shares that may be awarded under the 2018 Incentive Plan pursuant to the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) is 891,764 shares (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options), and the number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units is 356,705 shares. However, the 2018 Incentive Plan contains a flex feature that provides that awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units in excess of the 356,705 share limitation may be granted but each share of stock covered by such excess award shall reduce the 891,764 share limitation for awards of stock options and SARs by 3.0 shares of common stock. The Company converted 462,522 awards of stock options into 154,174 restricted stock units in 2018, 45,000 awards of stock options into 15,000 restricted stock units in 2020 and 191,145 awards of stock options into 63,715 restriced stock units in 2022. Under the 2018 Incentive Plan, the Company made grants equal to 674,645 shares on December 4, 2018 which include 119,176 incentive options to executive officers, 44,590 non-qualified options to outside directors, 322,254 restricted stock units to executive officers, 40,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers and 148,625 restricted stock units to outside directors. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company awarded 40,000 incentive options and 15,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers under the 2018 Incentive Plan. Awards to directors generally vest 20 % annually beginning with the first anniversary of the date of grant. Awards to a director with fewer than five years of service at the time of grant vest over a longer period and will not become fully vested until the director has completed ten years of service. Awards to the executive officer who is not a director vest 20 % annually beginning on December 4, 2020. On April 1, 2022, the Company awarded 23,718 incentive options to an executive officer, 30,659 incentive options to non-executive officers and 13,952 non-qualified options to an outside director. In addition, on April 1, 2022 the Company awarded 40,460 restricted stock units to executive officers and 23,255 restricted stock units to outside directors. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum number of stock options and SARs remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was 189,476 . As of June 30, 2022, the maximum number of stock options and SARs remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was 4,883 , after the conversion from PDL Community Bancorp common stock to Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock or restricted stock units remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was none , for both periods. If the 2018 Incentive Plan’s flex feature described above were fully utilized, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be awarded as restricted stock or restricted stock units would be 1,627 as of June 30, 2022 and 63,159 as of December 31, 2021, but would eliminate the availability of stock options and SARs available for award. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determine the fair value of restricted stock units under the Company’s 2018 Incentive Plan. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. 34 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 10.

Compensation and Benefit Plans (Continued) A summary of the Company’s stock option awards activity and related information for six months ended June 30, 2022 and year ended December 31, 2021 are as follows: June 30, 2022 Options Weighted- Average Exercise Price Per Share Outstanding, beginning of year 203,766 $ 12.02 Conversion and reorganization 80,526 — Granted — — Exercised — — Forfeited — — Outstanding at March 31 (1) 284,292 8.62 Granted 68,329 10.44 Exercised — — Forfeited — — Outstanding at June 30 (1) 352,621 $ 8.97 Exercisable at June 30 (1) 147,301 $ 8.74 December 31, 2021 Options Weighted- Average Exercise Price Per Share Outstanding, beginning of year 203,766 $ 12.02 Granted — — Exercised — — Forfeited — — Outstanding at December 31 ( 1 ) 203,766 $ 12.02 Exercisable at December 31 ( 1 ) 94,904 $ 12.45 (1) The aggregate intrinsic value, which represents the difference between the price of the Company’s common stock at respective periods and the stated exercise price of the underlying options, was $ 96,000 for outstanding options and $ 74,000 for exercisable options at June 30, 2022 and was $ 505,000 for outstanding options and $ 195,000 or exercisable options December 31, 2021. The weighted-average exercise price for the options as of June 30, 2022 was $ 8.97 per share and the weighted average remaining contractual life is 7.2 years. The weighted average period over which compensation expenses are expected to be recognized is 5.0 years. There were 147,301 shares and 94,904 shares exercisable as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Total compensation cost related to stock options recognized was $ 44,000 and $ 33,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively and $ 77,000 and $ 66,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options was $ 539,000 , which is expected to be recognized over the next 22 quarters . The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 Dividend yield 0.00 % 0.00 % Expected life 6.5 years 6.5 years Expected volatility 41.34 % 38.51 % Risk-free interest rate 2.65 % 0.48 % Weighted average grant date fair value $ 3.85 $ 3.77 36 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 10. Compensation and Benefit Plans (Continued) The expected volatility is based on the Company’s historical volatility. The expected life is an estimate based on management’s review of the various factors and calculated using the simplified method for plain vanilla options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s history and expectation of dividend payouts. Treasury Stock : As a result of the conversion and reorganization, all shares of treasury stock of PDL Community Bancorp were retired on January 27, 2022. Note 11. Earnings Per Share The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: For the Three Months Ended June 30, For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (Dollars in thousands except share data) Net income (loss) $ 771 $ 5,932 $ ( 6,049 ) $ 8,384 Common shares outstanding for basic EPS: Weighted average common shares outstanding 24,724,274 17,255,592 23,739,658 17,167,691 Less: Weighted average unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) shares 1,667,715 518,555 1,495,882 524,553 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 23,056,559 16,737,037 22,243,776 16,643,138 Basic earnings (loss) per common share $ 0.03 $ 0.35 $ ( 0.27 ) $ 0.50 Potential dilutive common shares: Add: Dilutive effect of restricted stock awards and stock options 72,352 36,569 — 18,285 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 23,128,911 16,773,606 22,243,776 16,661,423 Diluted earnings (loss) per common share $ 0.03 $ 0.35 $ ( 0.27 ) $ 0.50 Note 1 2 . Commitments, Contingencies and Credit Risk Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk : In the normal course of business, financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk may be used to meet the financing needs of customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement in particular classes of financial instruments. The contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit represent the amounts of potential accounting loss should the contract be fully drawn upon, the customer default, and the value of any existing collateral become worthless. The same credit policies are used in making commitments and contractual obligations as for on-balance-sheet instruments. Financial instruments whose contractual amounts represent credit risk at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows: June 30, December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Commitments to grant mortgage loans $ 175,992 $ 127,159 Commitments to sell loans at lock-in rates 7,058 13,321 Unfunded commitments under lines of credit 87,470 80,033 $ 270,520 $ 220,513 37 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 12. Commitments, Contingencies and Credit Risk (Continued) Commitments to Grant Mortgage Loans : Commitments to grant mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as all terms and conditions are met as established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties. Material losses are not anticipated as a result of these transactions. Commitments to Sell Loans at Lock-in Rates: In order to assure itself of a marketplace to sell its loans, Mortgage World has agreements with investors who will commit to purchase loans at locked-in rates. Mortgage World has off-balance sheet market risk to the extent that Mortgage World does not obtain matching commitments from these investors to purchase the loans. This will expose Mortgage World to the lower of cost or market valuation environment. Repurchases, Indemnifications and Premium Recaptures : Loans sold by Mortgage World under investor programs are subject to repurchase or indemnification if they fail to meet the origination criteria of those programs. In addition, loans sold to investors are also subject to repurchase or indemnifications if the loan is two or three months delinquent during a set period which usually varies from six months to a year after the loan is sold. There are no open repurchase or indemnification requests for loans sold as a correspondent lender or where the Company acted as a broker in the transaction as of June 30, 2022. Unfunded Commitments Under Lines of Credit : Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extension of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit are uncollateralized and usually contain a specified maturity date and, ultimately, may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed. Letters of Credit : Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Letters of credit are largely cash secured. Concentration by Geographic Location : Loans, commitments to extend credit and letters of credit have been granted to customers who are located primarily in the New York City metropolitan area. Generally, such loans most often are secured by one-to-four family residential. The loans are expected to be repaid from the borrowers' cash flows. Loan Concentrations : As of June 30, 2022, approximately 46.7 % of Mortgage World’s, a division of the Bank, total originated loan volume was insured and approximately 83.9 % of total originated loan volume was sold to three investors. The Bank’s Mortgage World division has closed approximately 99.4 % of its loan volume in two states, New York and New Jersey. Lease Commitments : At June 30, 2022, there are noncancelable operating leases for office space that expire on various dates through 2038 . Certain of these leases contains escalation clauses providing for increased rental based on pre-scheduled annual increases or on increases in real estate taxes. On February 11, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 3821 Bergenline Avenue, Union City, New Jersey for a sale price of $ 2.4 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $ 145,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.5 %. Under the lease agreement, the Bank has four (4) consecutive options to extend the term of the lease by five (5) years for each such option. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $ 623,000 , net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. On June 4, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 5560 Broadway, Bronx, New York for a sale price of $ 5.7 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $ 281,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.75 %. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $ 4.2 million, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Rental expenses under operating leases, included in occupancy expense, totaled $ 1.0 million and $ 555,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, and $ 2.1 million and $ 1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 38 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 12. Commitments, Contingencies and Credit Risk (Continued) The projected minimum rental payments under the terms of the leases at June 30, 2022 are as follows: (in thousands) Remainder of 2022 $ 1,801 2023 3,607 2024 3,657 2025 3,615 2026 3,441 2027 3,308 Thereafter 28,921 $ 48,350 Legal Matters : The Company is involved in various legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal course of business. Management believes that resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Note 13. Fair Value The following fair value hierarchy is used based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2 – Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: Cash and Cash Equivalents, Placements with Banks, Accrued Interest Receivable, Advance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance, and Accrued Interest Payable : The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. These assets and liabilities are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Available-for-Sale Securities : These financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models (e.g., matrix pricing) or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Examples of such instruments include government agency bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Level 3 securities are securities for which significant unobservable inputs are utilized. There were no changes in valuation techniques used to measure similar assets during the period. FHLBNY Stock : The carrying value of FHLBNY stock approximates fair value since the Bank can redeem such stock with FHLBNY at cost. As a member of the FHLBNY, the Company is required to purchase this stock, which is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. Loans Receivable : For variable rate loans, which reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, carrying values are a reasonable estimate of fair values, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using estimated market rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. Impaired loans are valued using a present value discounted cash flow method, or the fair value of the collateral. Loans are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale : Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, consists of mortgage loans originated for sale by Mortgage World and accounted for under the fair value option. These assets are valued using stated investor pricing for substantially equivalent loans as Level 2. In determining fair value, such measurements are derived based on observable market data, including whole-loan transaction pricing and similar market transactions adjusted for portfolio composition, servicing value and market conditions. Loans held for sale by the Bank are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by investor bid prices. 39 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 13. Fair Value (Continued) Under the fair value option, management has elected, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, fair value for substantially all forms of mortgage loans originated for sale on a recurring basis. The fair value carrying amount of mortgages held for sale measured under the fair value option was $ 9.2 million and the aggregate unpaid principal amounted to $ 9.2 million. Interest Rate Lock Commitments : The Bank, through its Mortgage World division, enters into rate lock commitments to extend credit to borrowers for generally up to a 60 day period for origination and/or purchase of loans. To the extent that a loan is ultimately granted and the borrower ultimately accepts the terms of the loan, these loan commitments expose the Bank’s Mortgage World division to variability in its fair value due to changes in interest rates. The FASB determined that loan commitments related to the origination or acquisition of mortgage loans that will be held for sale must be accounted for as derivative instruments. Such commitments, along with any related fees received from potential borrowers, are recorded at fair value in derivative assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in income on sale of mortgage loans. Fair value is based on active market pricing for substantially similar underlying mortgage loans commonly referred to as best execution pricing or investment commitment pricing, if the loan is committed to an investor through a best efforts contract. In valuing interest rate lock commitments, there are several unobservable inputs such as the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights, estimated remaining cost to originate the loans, and the pull through rate of the open pipeline. Accordingly, such derivative is classified as Level 3. The approximate notional amounts of Mortgage World’s derivative instruments were $ 7.1 million and $ 13.3 million at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fair value of derivatives related to interest rate lock commitments not subject to a forward loan sale commitment, amounted to $ 135,000 and $ 172,000 as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and is included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial position. The table below presents the changes in derivatives from interest rate lock commitments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: (in thousands) Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 172 Change in fair value of derivative instrument reported in earnings ( 20 ) Balance as of March 31, 2022 152 Change in fair value of derivative instrument reported in earnings ( 17 ) Balance as of June 30, 2021 $ 135 Other Real Estate Owned : Other real estate owned represents real estate acquired through foreclosure, and is recorded at fair value less estimated disposal costs on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the asset is classified as Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the asset is classified as Level 3. Deposits : The fair values of demand deposits, savings, NOW and money market accounts equal their carrying amounts, which represent the amounts payable on demand at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-term, fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates on certificates of deposit to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on such deposits. Deposits are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. FHLBNY Advances : The fair value of the advances is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current market-based FHLBNY interest rates for advances of similar maturity to a schedule of maturities of such advances. These borrowings are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Warehouse Lines of Credit : The carrying amounts of warehouse lines of credit and mortgage loan funding payable approximate fair value and due to their short-term nature are classified as Level 2. Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments : Fair values for off-balance-sheet instruments (lending commitments and standby letters of credit) are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit standing. Off-balance-sheet instruments are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 40 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 13.

Fair Value (Continued) The fair value information about financial instruments are disclosed, whether or not recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. The estimated fair value amounts for 2022 and 2021 have been measured as of their respective period-ends and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these consolidated financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than amounts reported at each period. The information presented should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only required for a limited portion of the Company's assets and liabilities. Due to the wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company's disclosures and those of other banks may not be meaningful. Note 1 4 . Regulatory Capital Requirements The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s operations and financial statements. Under the regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total risk-based and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (as defined), common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined), and Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets (as defined) adjusted total assets (as defined). As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the applicable capital adequacy requirements specified below have been met. The below minimum capital requirements exclude the capital conservation buffer required to avoid limitations on capital distributions including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The applicable capital buffer for the Bank was 28.00 % at June 30, 2022 and 9.23 % at December 31, 2021. The most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Company and the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, common equity risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There were no conditions or events since then that have changed the Bank's category. 44 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 14.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Ponce Financial Group, Inc.

While it appears the COVID-19 pandemic has entered into an endemic stage, related measures taken by governments, businesses and individuals as a result of the pandemic continue to cause uncertainty, volatility and disruption in the economy, including the economies of the markets that we serve. In response to the pandemic, we adjusted our business practices, including restricting employee travel, encouraging employees to work from home when possible, implementing social distancing guidelines within our offices, and continuing to hold regular meetings of our pandemic response team. Certain of these measures remain in place due to the continued prevalence of the virus, though, as of June 30, 2022, all of our customer locations are open and the majority of our employees have schedules that include work at the office. 50 Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following discussion contains certain non-GAAP financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial information. The Company’s non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP information which may be presented by other companies. In all cases, it should be understood that non-GAAP operating measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders. An item that management excludes when computing non-GAAP adjusted earnings can be of substantial importance to the Company’s results and condition for any particular year. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided below. The SEC has exempted from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on GAAP. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. However, the information should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The table below includes references to the Company's net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 before gain on sale of real property and the Company’s contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation. In management's view, that information, which is considered non-GAAP information, may be useful to investors as it will improve an understanding of core operations for the current and future periods. The non-GAAP net (loss) income amount and (loss) earnings per share reflect adjustments related to the non-recurring gain on sale of real property and the Company’s contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation, net of tax effect. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP information to GAAP net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share is provided below. Non-GAAP Reconciliation – Net (Loss) Income before Gain on Sale of Real Property and Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation (Unaudited) Six Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 June 30, 2021 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net (loss) income - GAAP $ (6,049 ) $ 8,384 Gain on sale of real property — (4,839 ) Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation 4,995 — Income tax (benefit) provision (1,049 ) 1,016 Net (loss) income - non-GAAP $ (2,103 ) $ 4,561 (Loss) earnings per common share (GAAP) (1) $ (0.27 ) $ 0.50 (Loss) earnings per common share (non-GAAP) (1) $ (0.09 ) $ 0.27 (1) (Loss) earnings per share were computed (for the GAAP and non-GAAP basis) based on the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 (22,243,776 shares and 16,643,138 shares, respectively). COVID-19 Pandemic and the CARES Act On March 27, 2020, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) to address the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act appropriated $349.0 billion for PPP loans and on April 24, 2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) received another $310.0 billion in PPP funding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act appropriated $284.0 billion for both first and second draw PPP loans, bringing the total appropriations for PPP loans to $943.0 billion. PPP ended on May 31, 2021. Loans under the PPP that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The Company had received SBA approval and originated 5,340 PPP loans, of which 405 loans totaling $30.8 million were outstanding at June 30, 2022. PPP loans have a two-year or five-year term, provide for fees of up to 5% of the loan amount and earn interest at a rate of 1% per annum. It is our expectation that a significant portion of these remaining loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. As of June 30, 2022, the average authorized loan size was $76,000 and the median authorized loan size was $12,000. The Bank, which is designated as both a Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) and a Minority 51 Depository Institution (“MDI”), originated 5 , 340 PPP loans in the amount of $ 2 61 . 4 million , which, based upon information provided by the SBA , significantly exceed ed the reported average performance of banks in our peer group . As a result of the initial COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the Company continues to alter the way it has historically provided services to its deposit customers while seeking to maintain normal day-to-day back-office operations and lending functions. To that end, as of June 30, 2022, all back-office and lending personnel have been formed into teams which alternate between a remote and in office work environment while the branch network continues to provide traditional banking services to its communities and has for the most part returned to normal operating hours while continuing to shift service delivery to electronic and web-based products. The Company continues its extensive and intensive communications program geared to informing customers of the alternative resources provided by the Company for retaining access to financial services, closing loans and conducting banking transactions, such as ATM networks, online banking, mobile applications, remote deposits and the Company’s Contact Center. The Company proactively manages its day-to-day operations by using video and telephonic conferencing. The Company remains vigilant of the potential for other COVID-19 variant outbreaks and remains prepared to restore the necessary protocols to minimize any disruptions to its current operations and services. Federal Economic Relief Funds To Aid Lending On August 10, 2021, the Company through its subsidiary, the Bank, received from the United States Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) a grant in the amount of $1.8 million in federal Economic Relief Funds for Small Businesses under the Treasury’s Rapid Response Program for CDFIs. The Rapid Response Program grants may be used to support eligible activities of CDFIs such as financial products, financial services, development services, and certain operational activities, and to enable recipient CDFIs to build capital reserves and loan-loss reserves. On June 7, 2022, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. (the “Company”), the holding company for Ponce Bank,‎ closed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 225,000 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A‎, par value $0.01 (the “Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price equal to $225,000,000 in cash, to the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) pursuant to the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”).‎ The holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a dividend payable in cash quarterly at an annual rate dependent on certain factors as reported by the Company to Treasury in a quarterly supplemental report. The initial dividend rate is zero percent for the first two years after issuance, and thereafter the floor dividend rate is 0.50% and the ceiling dividend rate is 2.00%. The actual dividend rate that will be paid by the Company on the Preferred Stock cannot be determined at this time. The ECIP investment by the Treasury is part of a program to invest over $8.7 billion into Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) or ‎Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), of which Ponce Bank is both. The ECIP is intended to incentivize CDFIs and MDIs to provide loans, grants, ‎and forbearance to small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers in low-income and underserved communities that may have been ‎disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. Critical Accounting Policies Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management and that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets, liabilities or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is established as probable incurred losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. See Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the accompanying Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. 52 Factors Affecting the Comparability of Results Sale of Real Property. O n February 11, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 3821 Bergenline Avenue, Union City, New Jersey for a sale price of $2.4 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $145,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.5%. Under the lease agreement, the Bank has four (4) consecutive options to extend the term of the lease by five (5) years for each such option. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $623,000, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations . On June 4, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 5560 Broadway, Bronx, New York for a sale price of $5.7 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $281,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.75%. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $4.2 million, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Ponce De Leon Foundation. On January 27, 2022, the Company made a $5.0 million contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation as part of the conversion and reorganization, which is included in non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Write-off and Write-Down. In 2020, the Company entered into a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain. Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to $1,000 and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originates and services these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan is found to be fraudulent, becomes 120 days delinquent upon 120 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.” The Bank, pursuant to its agreement with Grain, at December 31, 2021, had 59,180 microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with credit extensions aggregating $33.9 million. Of these microloans, the Bank estimates that 80 percent have been made in low- and low-to-moderate income census tracts with an estimated 56 percent made to minority borrowers. At June 30, 2022, the Bank had 43,073 microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $28.3 million and which were performing, in management’s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by a $1.4 million allowance for loan losses, resulting in $26.9 million in microloans, net of allowance for loan losses. Since the beginning of the Bank’s agreement with Grain and through June 30, 2022, 29,592 microloans amounting to $20.4 million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain. The Company has written-down a total of $9.6 million of the Grain Receivable for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and received $6.0 million in cash from Grain and through the application of security deposits connected to fraudulent loan accounts. The Bank also opted to use the $1.8 million grant it received from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Rapid Response ‎Program to defray the Grain Receivable. The application of those amounts resulted in a net receivable of $3.0 million. As of June 30, 2022, the Company’s total exposure to Grain was $30.9 million as a result of the $3.0 million of net receivable, $26.9 million of the remaining microloans, net of allowance for loan losses and an equity investment in Grain by the Company of $1.0 million. Grain has been victimized by cyber fraud using synthetic and other forms of fraudulent identifications, a phenomenon that has become prevalent with FinTechs. Grain has agreed to apply at least 100% of origination and servicing fees received from the Bank as payment for the Grain Receivable, and, upon the completion of a series A financing, pay all amounts due on the Grain Receivable. Grain remains a pre-profit startup highly dependent on earnings from its relationship with the Bank, a new relationship with another financial institution, and further capital raises which may not materialize. Accordingly, Grain’s ability to pay the Grain Receivable in the short term, taking into account current economic conditions and regulatory requirements, was considered. 53 In arriving at the amounts to be written-off and written-down, the Company considered, among other things, the Bank’s right to offset security deposits associated with fraudulent loans, payments received from Grain subsequent to December 31, 2021, and the discounted net present value of future cash flows reasonably expected to be received by the Bank from Grain over the next 1 5 months, based on prior payments, and the Bank’s estimate for any additional incurred fraudulent identities in the Grain portfolio. The Bank determined that a 12% discount rate was appropriate in calculating net present value of such payments. In addition, the Bank has considered the likelihood of Grain prevailing in litigation it has instituted against a third party vendor where Grain is demanding damages resulting from fraudulent loans originated by Grain that were subject to the synthetic identifications that Grain’s vendor failed to identify. Grain is presently conducting a capital raise in the form of a private placement of securities which has not been incorporated into the analysis. Grain is also currently in the process of reviewing and affirming the compliance of the remaining loans in the portfolio, which may have additional fraudulent losses that are currently not estimable. The Company continues to closely monitor its portfolio of consumer loans originated by Grain as well as Grain’s refinement of solutions for detecting and preventing cyber fraud in the application for microloans. The Company has requested, and Grain has agreed, that no new microloans be originated until further notice and that further extensions of credit to an existing microloan borrower only be made upon confirmation that such borrower is not fraudulent. The Company also evaluates on a monthly basis the likelihood that Grain will be able to make payments on the Grain Receivable. If, as a result of its continuing evaluation, the Company determines that Grain will not be able to make timely payments on the Grain Receivable or additional Grain originated microloans are found to be fraudulent, the Bank may be required to write-off some or all of the remaining value of the Grain Receivable, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. Further, like other start-up companies, there is a higher level of risk that Grain may not be able to execute its business plan and may fail. In the event Grain were to cease operations, and although it has considered contingency plans, the Bank may have greater difficulty in servicing and collecting the microloan portfolio. In such a case, the level the Bank has provided for in its allowance for loan losses for its microloan portfolio may be inadequate and it may need to increase its provision for loan losses, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. As a consequence of such events the Bank may determine it appropriate to terminate its relationship with Grain and the value of the Company’s equity investment in Grain could become impaired. The $1.5 million and $9.6 million write-off and write-down is included in non-interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Vision 2025 Evolves The Company is now in the later stages of its multi-pronged effort to upgrade its infrastructure, adopt electronic banking services and restructure its retail business model. Dubbed internally “Vision 2020,” the effort has resulted in significant beneficial results, continues to involve significant investments and has served to ameliorate the otherwise detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of Vision 2020, the Company partnered with Salesforce to deploy applications throughout the organization, including retail services, lending processes, back-office operations, digital banking and loan underwriting. Although the full implementation of the applications, dubbed internally as “GPS, a Guided Path to Success,” was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was fully implemented by the end 2021. The infrastructure upgrade has focused primarily on implementing technology, cybersecurity and network progression while establishing a Virtual Private Network (“VPN”). To date the infrastructure upgrade has resulted in relocating and migrating network and in-house servers, replacing outdated PCs, enhancing internet capabilities, purchasing and deploying VPN-enabled laptops to a significant majority of the Bank’s personnel and the redeployment of disaster recovery capabilities. The Company has achieved certain manpower-related cost savings and enabled the uninterrupted continuity of operations by its staff working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic using its newly deployed disaster recovery capabilities. The infrastructure upgrade has added resiliency, capacity and redundancies to the Company’s technology structures and enhances the capability of the Company to increase its flexibility with alternate locations of personnel. The Company has adopted and deployed over 48 new electronic banking services, products and applications since late 2018. These services range from on-line banking, mobile banking, bill pay, positive pay, remote deposit capture, cash management services, e-statements, data storage and management, ACH services, electronic document storage, a paperless environment, dual-language telephone banking service and VoIP telecommunications with an automation-based, dual-language Customer Contact Center. These services have not only enabled the Company to continue serving its customers as they, and the Company, converted to a remote work environment; the services have served to increase the product penetration and deepening relationships with customers. The Company has also added to its social media capabilities and has begun to use them in coordination with new targeted marketing campaigns now enabled by GPS and its Marketing Cloud platform. The combination of social media and targeted marketing campaigns was particularly effective with PPP loan originations using many partnerships established with non-profit groups and community-based organizations. Such efforts enabled the Company to more than triple the number of second round PPP loan applications compared to the first round, and has resulted in significant growth in retail deposits and new relationships. 54 The Company is also in the final stages of deploying a Fin t ech-based small business automated lending technology in partnership with LendingFront Technologies, Inc. The t echnology is a mobile application that digitizes the lending workflow from pre-approval to servicing and enables the Company to originate, close and fund small business loans within very short spans of time, without requiring a physical presence within banking offices and with automated underwriting using both traditional and non-traditional methods. The application has full loan origination and servicing capabilities and is integrated with Sales f orce. A ll Commercial Relationship Officers and Business Development Managers will utilize these capabilities upon the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic and completion of a pilot test . The Company is seeking to establish loan origination partnerships with non-profit and community-based organizations to ensure penetration in underserved and underbanked markets . The Company also established a relationship with SaveBetter, LLC, a fintech startup focusing on brokered deposits. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had $47.4 million in such deposits. The recent regulatory easing of brokered deposit rules may enable the Company to classify such deposits as core deposits. The Company’s on-going adoption of a new retail business model has been all-encompassing. It has involved the redesign of its retail branches, the shift of branch operations to a centralized back office, the deployment of smart ITM-enabled ATMs and Teller Cash Recyclers, the automation of manual processes and, importantly, the adoption of universal bankers and retail sales. In 2019, the Company earned national recognition as Branch Innovators of the Year for its retail banking model at the 2019 Future Branches Retail Banking Summit in Austin, Texas. The Company continues to renovate its branches at costs significantly less than previous efforts largely as a result of economies of scale, design modifications and adoption of buildout techniques used by non-bank retail organizations. During the second quarter of 2022, the Company completed the Schematic Design phase of Southern Boulevard, Westchester Avenue, Smith Street, Jackson Heights and Union City branches and plans to break ground on all during fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. Surveys are completed at Forest Hills and Stuyvesant Town branches, but commencement of design and construction has not yet been scheduled at these locations. The Company continues to incorporate loan origination personnel into its retail branches including a branded Ponce Mortgage Center celebrating the comprehensive offerings made possible by our affiliate the Ponce De Leon Mortgage Corporation as well as the Bank’s new division, Mortgage World Bankers. The Company still anticipates creating a full-service branch at its mortgage office located in Flushing, Queens, New York and a banking satellite at its office in Bergenfield, New Jersey, but these projects are temporarily on hold pending completion of other renovations. The Company’s mortgage office in Flushing, Queens, will expand the Company’s reach into one of the most underserved areas of Queens according to recently reported PPP loan penetration data. Vision 2020 already has had a transformational effect on the Company. The Company had approximately $1.06 billion in assets, $918.5 million in loans and $809.8 million in deposits, at December 31, 2018. The Company has since grown to $2.04 billion in assets, $1.32 billion in loans receivables, net of allowance for loan losses of $17.5 million, and $1.15 billion in deposits at June 30, 2022, all while investing in infrastructure, implementing digital banking, acquiring Mortgage World, adopting GPS, diversifying its product offering, meeting the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, partnering with Fintech companies and assisting its communities with 5,340 PPP loans totaling $261.4 million. The Company raised over $132.0 million in additional capital through our conversion and reorganization and realized approximately $20.0 million in net gain while freeing up approximately $40.0 million in investable funds through our sale-and-leaseback initiative. Now, the Company believes that it is poised to enhance its presence, locally and in similar communities outside New York, as a leading CDFI and MDI financial institution holding company. On June 7, 2022, the Company issued 225,000 shares of the Company’s Preferred Stock‎, par value $0.01 for an aggregate purchase price equal to $225,000,000 in cash to the Treasury, pursuant to the Treasury’s ECIP‎ . Under the ECIP, Treasury provided investment capital directly to depository institutions that are CDFIs or MDIs or their holding companies, to provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers, in low-income and underserved communities. Treasury has indicated that the investment will qualify as Tier 1 capital . No dividends will accrue or be due for the first two years after issuance. For years three through ten, depending upon the level of qualified and/or deep impact lending made in targeted communities, as defined in the ECIP guidelines, dividends will be at an annual rate of either 2.0%, 1.25% or 0.5% and, thereafter, will be fixed at one of the foregoing rates. Holders of Preferred Stock generally do not have any voting rights, with the exception of voting rights on certain matters as outlined in the Certificate of Designations. The Company has the option to redeem the shares of Preferred Stock (i) in whole or in part on any dividend payment date on or after June 15, 2027, or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within ninety days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, as defined in the Purchase Agreement, in each case at a cash redemption price equal to the liquidation amount, with an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not paid prior to the redemption date. The Company may not redeem shares of Preferred Stock without having received the prior approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency for the Company, as defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, to the extent required under applicable capital rules. Such redemptions are subject to certain conditions and limitations, as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. The Company is cementing Vision 2025, its roadmap to acquiring the resources needed to lead efforts to remediate the disparate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the wealth and financial gaps present in its communities and similar communities outside the New York City metropolitan area. The Company traces its roots to its organization in 1960 as Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan 55 Association by Latino leaders concerned that the financial needs of the Bronx and its Latino population were not being recognized and addressed . True to its roots, the Company remains committed to ensuring that the disparate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the wealth and financial gaps present in minority communities are addressed in earnest . The following table presents the Company’s PPP loans outstanding as of June 30, 2022: Aggregate Median Average Number Amount Amount Amount State Counties of Loans of Loans of Loans of Loans (Dollars in thousands) New York Albany 1 $ 104 $ 104 $ 104 Bronx 99 3,135 12 32 Dutchess 1 10 10 10 Kings 51 16,885 15 331 Nassau 26 672 9 26 New York 59 3,185 15 54 Orange 3 36 11 12 Queens 97 3,739 14 39 Richmond 5 257 14 51 Rockland 2 125 63 63 Suffolk 8 111 11 14 Westchester 10 100 8 10 Total New York 362 $ 28,359 $ 12 $ 78 New Jersey Bergen 11 $ 579 $ 16 $ 53 Camden 1 21 21 21 Essex 9 82 5 9 Hudson 9 1,052 15 117 Mercer 2 52 26 26 Monmouth 1 507 507 507 Ocean 3 24 6 8 Passaic 4 45 12 11 Union 2 16 8 8 Total New Jersey 42 $ 2,378 $ 14 $ 57 Pennsylvania Berks 1 16 16 16 Total 405 $ 30,753 $ 12 $ 76 Comparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 Total Assets . Total consolidated assets increased $388.8 million, or 23.5%, to $2.04 billion at June 30, 2022 from $1.65 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in total assets is attributable to increases of $210.6 million in held-to-maturity securities and $120.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. Other increases in total assets are $26.7 million in available-for-sale securities, $19.2 million in net loans receivable (inclusive of $106.0 million net decrease in PPP loans), $10.4 million in FHLBNY stock, $5.8 million in deferred tax assets, $1.5 million in other assets and $893,000 in accrued interest receivable. The increase in total assets was reduced by decreases of $6.6 million in mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value and $672,000, net, in premises and equipment. Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents increased $120.9 million, or 78.6%, to $274.8 million at June 30, 2022, compared to $153.9 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of Preferred Stock to the Treasury, proceeds from advances from the FHLBNY, proceeds from maturities/calls of securities, net increase in other liabilities and the sale of loans. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was offset by purchases of securities, a decrease in net deposits, an increase in net loans, a decrease in advances of warehouse lines of credit, net purchases of FHLBNY stock and a contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation. 56 Securities. The composition of securities at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and the amounts maturing of each classification are summarized as follows: June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Amortized Fair Amortized Fair Cost Value Cost Value (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities: U.S. Government Bonds: Amounts maturing: Three months or less $ — $ — $ — $ — More than three months through one year — — — — More one year through five years 2,983 2,719 2,981 2,934 More than five years through ten years — — — — 2,983 2,719 2,981 2,934 Corporate Bonds: Amounts maturing: Three months or less — — — — More than three months through one year — — — — More one year through five years 4,000 3,713 4,445 4,381 More than five years through ten years 21,841 20,318 16,798 16,803 25,841 24,031 21,243 21,184 Mortgage-Backed Securities 130,132 113,294 90,950 89,228 Total Available-for-Sale Securities $ 158,956 $ 140,044 $ 115,174 $ 113,346 Held-to-Maturity Securities: Amounts maturing: Three months or less $ — $ — $ — $ — More than three months through one year — — — — More one year through five years 75,000 75,007 — — More than five years through ten years 4,000 4,000 — — 79,000 79,007 — — Mortgage-Backed Securities 132,517 132,345 934 914 Total Held-to-Maturity Securities $ 211,517 $ 211,352 $ 934 $ 914 The Company securities portfolio increased $210.6 million in held-to-maturity and $26.7 million increase in available-for-sale during the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was mainly attributable to $210.6 million in held-to-maturity securities and $58.4 million in available-for-sale securities that were purchased during the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was offset primarily by $17.2 million in unrealized loss, $8.9 million in principal payments and two available-for-sale securities in the amount of $5.4 million that matured and/or were called during the six months ended June 30, 2022.

The composition of gross loans receivable at June 30, 2022 and at December 31, 2021 and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows: June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Increase (Decrease) Amount Percent Amount Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential Investor-Owned $ 321,671 24.0 % $ 317,304 24.1 % $ 4,367 1.4 % Owner-Occupied 100,048 7.5 % 96,947 7.3 % 3,101 3.2 % Multifamily residential 396,470 29.6 % 348,300 26.3 % 48,170 13.8 % Nonresidential properties 279,877 20.9 % 239,691 18.1 % 40,186 16.8 % Construction and land 165,425 12.3 % 134,651 10.2 % 30,774 22.9 % Total mortgage loans 1,263,491 94.3 % 1,136,893 86.0 % 126,598 11.1 % Nonmortgage loans: Business loans (1) 45,720 3.4 % 150,512 11.4 % (104,792 ) (69.6 %) Consumer loans (2) 30,198 2.3 % 34,693 2.6 % (4,495 ) (13.0 %) Total nonmortgage loans 75,918 5.7 % 185,205 14.0 % (109,287 ) (59.0 %) Total $ 1,339,409 100.0 % $ 1,322,098 100.0 % $ 17,311 1.3 % (1) As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, business loans include $30.8 million and $136.8 million, respectively, of PPP loans. (2) As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, consumer loans include $28.3 million and $33.9 million of microloans originated by the Bank pursuant to its arrangement with Grain. The $17.3 million increase in the gross loan portfolio was primarily the result of an increase of $125.2 million in non-PPP loans, offset by a $106.0 million decrease in PPP loans at June 30, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. Based on current internal loan reviews, the Company believes that the quality of our underwriting, our weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 58.5% and our customer selection processes have served us well and provided us with a reliable base with which to maintain a well-protected loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans, as defined by applicable banking regulations, include multifamily residential, nonresidential properties, and construction and land mortgage loans. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximately 7.5% and 7.9%, respectively, of the outstanding principal balance of the Bank’s commercial real estate mortgage loans were secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses predominantly on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on valuation of the real estate. Banking regulations have established guidelines relating to the amount of construction and land mortgage loans and investor- owned commercial real estate mortgage loans of 100% and 300% of total risk-based capital, respectively. Should a bank’s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. The Bank’s policy is to operate within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and up to 400% for investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank’s total risk-based capital. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bank’s construction and land mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 33.4% and 79.6%, respectively. Investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 158.1% and 396.2% as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. At June 30, 2022, the Bank was within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and the 300% guideline for investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans established by banking regulators. Management believes that it has established the appropriate level of controls to monitor the Bank’s lending in these areas. Mortgage Loans Held For Sale . Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, at June 30, 2022 decreased $6.6 million to $9.2 million from $15.8 million at December 31, 2021. 58 Deposits. The composition of deposits at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and changes in dollars and percentages are summarized as follows: June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Increase (Decrease) Percent Percent Amount of Total Amount of Total Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Demand $ 284,462 24.8 % $ 274,956 22.8 % $ 9,506 3.5 % Interest-bearing deposits: NOW/IOLA accounts 28,597 2.5 % 35,280 2.9 % (6,683 ) (18.9 %) Money market accounts 181,156 15.8 % 186,893 15.5 % (5,737 ) (3.1 %) Reciprocal deposits 151,264 13.2 % 143,221 11.9 % 8,043 5.6 % Savings accounts 139,244 12.1 % 134,887 11.2 % 4,357 3.2 % Total NOW, money market, reciprocal and savings 500,261 43.6 % 500,281 41.5 % (20 ) (0.0 %) Certificates of deposit of $250K or more 65,157 5.7 % 78,454 6.5 % (13,297 ) (16.9 %) Brokered certificates of deposit 62,650 5.5 % 79,320 6.6 % (16,670 ) (21.0 %) Listing service deposits ( 1 ) 48,953 4.2 % 66,411 5.5 % (17,458 ) (26.3 %) Certificates of deposit less than $250K 187,245 16.2 % 205,294 17.1 % (18,049 ) (8.8 %) Total certificates of deposit 364,005 31.6 % 429,479 35.7 % (65,474 ) (15.2 %) Total interest-bearing deposits 864,266 75.2 % 929,760 77.2 % (65,494 ) (7.0 %) Total deposits $ 1,148,728 100.0 % $ 1,204,716 100.0 % $ (55,988 ) (4.6 %) (1) As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were $18.5 million and $29.0 million, respectively, in individual listing service deposits amounting to $250,000 or more. All brokered certificates of deposit individually amounted to less than $250,000. When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the Company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk and interest rate risk in line with management objectives. The Company’s Interest Rate Risk Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding and noncore funding reliance. The overall reliance on wholesale funding and noncore funding were within those policy limitations as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Management Asset/Liability Committee generally meets on a bi-weekly basis to review funding needs, if any, and to ensure the Company operates within the approved limitations. Advances from FHLBNY . The Bank had outstanding borrowings at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 of $159.4 million and $106.3 million in term advances from the FHLBNY, respectively and $175.0 million of overnight line of credit advance from the FHLBNY at June 30, 2022. The Bank had no overnight line of credit advance from the FHLBNY at December 31, 2021. Warehouse Lines of Credit . At December 31, 2021, Mortgage World had maintained two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the origination and sale of residential mortgages. At December 31, 2021, Mortgage World utilized $15.1 million for funding of mortgage loans held for sale and had unused lines of credit of $14.9 million. At June 30, 2022, there was no remaining balance on such lines of credit. During the first quarter of 2022, Mortgage World became a division of the Bank and the Bank began funding these loans. Stockholders’ Equity . The Company’s consolidated stockholders’ equity increased $328.8 million, or 173.8%, to $518.1 million at June 30, 2022 from $189.3 million at December 31, 2021. This increase in stockholders’ equity was mainly attributable to the $225.0 million issuance of Preferred Stock to the Treasury pursuant to its ECIP, $118.0 million as a result of the sale of common stock in the second-step mutual conversion and reorganization, $4.0 million equity contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation, $756,000 in share-based compensation and $690,000 in Employee Stock Ownership Plan shares committed to be released offset by $13.6 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss and $6.0 million in net loss. Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 The discussion of the Company’s results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 are presented below. The results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of future results. Ponce Financial Group, Inc., as the successor by merger with PDL Community Bancorp Consolidated Overview. Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was $771,000 compared to net income of $5.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Earnings per basic and diluted share was $0.03 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.35 for three months ended June 30, 2021. The $5.2 million decrease of net income for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021 was due to a decrease of $6.2 million of non-interest income attributable to a $4.2 million gain, net of expenses, from the sale of real property recognized for the six months ended 59 June 30, 2021 and a decrease of $1.1 million of income on sale of mortgage loans, an increase of $2.9 million in non-interest expenses and an increase of $231,000 in provision for loan losses. The decrease in net income was offset by a $2.4 million decrease in provision for income taxes and an increase of $1.8 million in net interest income. Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $1.3 million, or 8.4%, to $17.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 from $ 15.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Interest income on loans receivable, which is the Company’s primary source of income, increased $454,000, or 2.9%, to $16.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 from $ 15.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 . Interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks increased $739,000, or 309.2%, to $978,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 from $239,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Interest on deposits due from banks increase $130,000 to $132,000 from $2,000 quarter to quarter. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $433,000, or 20.5%, to $1.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 from $2.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to a lower average cost of funds. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $1.8 million, or 12.8%, to $15.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 from $13.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to three months ended June 30, 2021 was attributable to an increase of $1.3 million in interest and dividend income primarily due to increases of $739,000 in interest and dividend on securities, $454,000 in interest on loans receivable, $130,000 in interest on deposits due from banks and a decrease of $433,000 in interest expense due primarily to a lower average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest rate spread increased by 26 basis points to 3.86% for the three months ended June 30, 2022 from 3.60% for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in the net interest rate spread for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the average yields on interest-earning assets of 11 basis points to 4.54% for the three months ended June 30, 2022 from 4.43% for the three months ended June 30, 2021, and a decrease in the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 15 basis points to 0.68% for the three months ended June 30, 2022 from 0.83% for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Net interest margin increased 26 basis points for the three months ended June 30, 2022, to 4.10% from 3.84% for the three months ended June 30, 2021, reflecting both our organic loan growth and the amortization of fee income from our PPP lending. The historically low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response the turmoil resulting from COVID-19 pandemic is ending. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 2.25%-2.50% during its July 2022 meeting, the fourth consecutive rate hike, and pushing borrowing costs to the highest level since 2019. The Federal Reserve has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases during 2022. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. The Bank believes it is well positioned to withstand this rising interest rate environment in the near term as it is asset sensitive. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income decreased $6.2 million, or 73.9%, to $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 from $8.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease in non-interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021 was due to decreases of $4.2 million, net of expenses, from the sale of real properties recognized in the second quarter of 2021, $1.1 million in income on sale of mortgage loans, $874,000 in loan origination fees, $216,000 in brokerage commissions and $105,000 in late and prepayment charges, offset by increases of $218,000 in other non-interest income and $79,000 in service charges and fees. Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $2.9 million, or 21.5%, to $16.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 from $13.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in non-interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021 was attributable to increases of $2.7 million in compensation and benefits, $1.5 million in write-off and write-down in the second quarter of 2022 related to the receivable due from Grain for microloans originated by Grain and put back to Grain due to fraud, $399,000 in occupancy and equipment, $103,000 in other operating expenses and $91,000 in data processing expenses, offset by decreases of $1.2 million in professional fees and $646,000 in direct loan expenses. The increase of $2.7 million in compensation and benefits related to nonrecurring expense amortization related to PPP loans and new hires. Income Tax (Benefit) Provision. The Company had a benefit for income taxes of $488,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to a provision for income taxes of $1.9 million for three months ended June 30, 2021 .

The Company has two reportable segments; the Bank and, for the three months ended June 30, 2021, Mortgage World, and, for the three months ended June 30, 2022, Mortgage World as a division of the Bank. Income from the Bank consists primarily of interest and fees earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts.

Net interest income increased $1.6 million, or 12.0%, to $15.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 from $13.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily as a result of organic loan growth and a lower average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish the ALLL that, in management’s opinion, should be adequate to provide coverage for the inherent losses on outstanding loans. In evaluating the level of the ALLL, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit 64 losses. See Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —Allowance for Loan Losses” of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. After an evaluation of these factors, the Bank established a provision for loan losses for the three months ended June 30, 2022 of $817,000 compared to $586,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The provision for loan losses during the three months ended June 30, 2022 was impacted by the change in qualitative factors during the period related to the microloans originated by Grain. The provision for loan losses during the three months ended June 30, 2021 primarily reflects the Bank’s assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on borrowers and their ability to repay in the short-term. Non-interest Income . Non- interest income decreased $4.7 million, or 78.4%, to $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 from $6.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, mainly attributable to a non-recurring $4.2 million gain, net of expenses, from the sale of real property recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2021.

Non-interest expense increased $2.8 million, or 26.1%, to $13.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 from $10.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.8 million in compensation and benefits, related to nonrecurring expense amortization related to PPP loans and new hires, $1.5 million write-off and write-down related to the Grain Receivable due from Grain for microloans originated by Grain and put back to Grain. The increase of $2.8 million was offset by a decrease of $1.6 million in professional fees.

The decrease in Mortgage World’s total assets was primarily due to decreases of $6.6 million in mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, $51,000 in other assets and $31,000 in premises and equipment. The decrease in Mortgage World’s total 65 assets was offset by increases of $ 3 .2 million in cash and cash equivalents , $ 941 ,000 in loans receivable and $ 6 3,000 in accrued interest receivable. Net Income (Loss). Mortgage World’s net loss was ($838,000) for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to net income of $84,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Non-interest Income . Non-interest income decreased $1.6 million, or 61.5%, to $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 from $2.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021.

The results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of future results. Ponce Financial Group, Inc., as the successor by merger with PDL Community Bancorp Consolidated Overview. Net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was ($6.0 million) compared to net income of $8.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Loss per basic and diluted share was ($0.27) for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.50 for six months ended June 30, 2021. The net loss from net income for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021 was due to a decrease of $7.8 million in non-interest income (mainly due to a non-recurring $4.8 million gain, net of taxes, on sale of real property during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and a decrease of $2.2 million on income on the sale of mortgage loans), an increase of $18.1 million in non-interest expense (of which $9.6 million was attributable to the write-off and write-down related to the Grain Receivable and $5.0 million was the contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation) and an increase of $803,000 in provision for loan losses. The net loss was offset by increases of $6.2 million in net interest income and a $3.4 million benefit for income taxes, rather than a $2.6 million provision for income taxes year over year. Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $5.2 million, or 16.7%, to $36.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from $31.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Interest income on loans receivable, which is the Company’s primary source of income, increased $3.7 million, or 12.2%, to $34.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from $ 30.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to an increase in loans receivable in all categories except for a decrease of $106.0 million in PPP lending. Average loans receivable increased $35.7 million, or 2.8% to $1.32 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to $1.29 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks increased $1.4 million, or 291.1%, to $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from $ 493,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $1.0 million, or 23.6%, to $3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from $4.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to a lower average cost of funds. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $6.2 million, or 23.3%, to $32.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from $26.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to six months ended June 30, 2021 was attributable to an increase of $5.2 million in interest and dividend income primarily due to an increase in average loans receivable and a decrease of $1.0 million in interest expense due primarily to a lower average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest rate spread increased by 49 basis points to 4.17% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from 3.68% for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in the net interest rate spread for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the average yields on interest-earning assets of 28 basis points to 4.84% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from 4.56% for the six months ended June 30, 2021, and a decrease in the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 21 basis points to 0.67% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from 0.88% for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Net interest margin increased 47 basis points for the six months ended June 30, 2022, to 4.39% from 3.92% for the six months ended June 30, 2021, reflecting both our organic loan growth and the amortization of fee income from our PPP lending. The historically low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response the turmoil resulting from COVID-19 pandemic is ending. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 2.25%-2.50% during its July 2022 meeting, the fourth consecutive rate hike, and pushing borrowing costs to the highest level since 2019. The Federal Reserve has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases during 2022. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. The Bank believes it is well positioned to withstand this rising interest rate environment in the near term as it is asset sensitive. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income decreased $7.8 million, or 64.0%, to $4.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from $12.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease in non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021 was due to a one-time $4.8 million gain, net of expenses, from the sale of real properties recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and decreases of $2.2 million in income on sale of mortgage loans, $952,000 in loan origination fees, $291,000 in late and prepayment charges and $101,000 in brokerage commissions, offset by increases of $342,000 in other non-interest income, and $190,000 in service charges and fees. Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $18.1 million, or 68.1%, to $44.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from $26.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The $18.1 million increase in non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021 was attributable to an aggregate $9.6 million write-off and write down related to the receivable due from Grain for microloans originated by Grain and put back to Grain due to fraud and a $5.0 million contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation in connection with the second-step conversion and reorganization during the first quarter of 2022. Other increases in non-interest expense included $4.2 million in compensation and benefits, $957,000 in occupancy and equipment reflecting rental expenses on facilities that were sold and leased back and $344,000 in data processing expenses, offset by decreases of $1.1 million in professional fees and $781,000 in direct loan expenses. The $4.2 million increase of compensation and benefits related to nonrecurring expense amortization related to PPP loans and new hires. 67 Income Tax (Benefit) Provision. The Company had a benefit for income taxes of ($3.4 million) for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to a provision for income taxes of $2.6 million for six months ended June 30, 2021, resulting in effective tax rates of 36.2% and 24.0%, respectively . The increase in the effective tax rate is attributable to an increase of $1.7 million in the valuation allowance related to the unused non-deductible portion of the remaining charitable contribution deduction. Segments. The Company has two reportable segments; the Bank and, for the six months ended June 30, 2021, Mortgage World, and, for the six months ended June 30, 2022, Mortgage World as a division of the Bank. Income from the Bank consists primarily of interest and fees earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts. Income from Mortgage World consists primarily of taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they are sold to investors. The table below shows the results of operations for the Company’s segments, the Bank and Mortgage World, for the periods indicated.

The following table presents interest expense for the periods indicated: For the Six Months Ended June 30, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Certificates of deposit $ 1,480 $ 2,327 $ (847 ) (36.4 %) Money market 711 623 88 14.1 % Savings 65 78 (13 ) (16.7 %) NOW/IOLA 30 70 (40 ) (57.1 %) Advance payments by borrowers 2 2 — — % Borrowings 1,158 1,166 (8 ) (0.7 %) Total interest expense $ 3,446 $ 4,266 $ (820 ) (19.2 %) Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $6.0 million, or 22.6%, to $32.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from $26.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily as a result of organic loan growth and a lower average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish the ALLL that, in management’s opinion, should be adequate to provide coverage for the inherent losses on outstanding loans. In evaluating the level of the ALLL, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. See Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —Allowance for Loan Losses” of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. After an evaluation of these factors, the Bank established a provision for loan losses for the six months ended June 30, 2022 of $2.1 million compared to $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 . The provision for loan losses during the six months ended June 30, 2022 was impacted by the change in qualitative factors during the period related to the microloans originated by Grain. The provision for loan losses during the six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily reflects the Bank’s assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on borrowers and their ability to repay in the short-term. Non-interest Income . Non-interest income decreased $5.4 million, or 69.9%, to $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from $7.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. 71 The following table presents non-interest income for the periods indicated: For the Six Months Ended June 30, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Service charges and fees $ 885 $ 695 $ 190 27.3 % Brokerage commissions 297 138 159 — % Late and prepayment charges 251 542 (291 ) (53.7 %) Gain on sale of real property — 4,839 (4,839 ) (100.0 %) Other 909 1,557 (648 ) (41.6 %) Total non-interest income $ 2,342 $ 7,771 $ (5,429 ) (69.9 %) Non-interest Expense . Non-interest expense increased $12.9 million, or 62.5%, to $33.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from $20.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 . The increase was primarily due to an aggregate $9.6 million write-off and write-down related to the Grain Receivable due from Grain for microloans originated by Grain and put back to Grain due to fraud, and an increase of $3.9 million in compensation and benefits related to nonrecurring expense amortization related to PPP loans and new hires.

Mortgage World’s net loss was ($1.7 million) for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to net income of $121,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Non-interest Income . Non-interest income decreased $2.7 million, or 53.7%, to $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from $5.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 . The decrease in non-interest income was attributable to a decrease of $2.2 million in gain on sale of mortgage loans.

The most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of the Bank’s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of its financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. The Bank’s Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in the Bank’s assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given the business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with policies and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank currently utilizes a third-party modeling solution that is prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate its sensitivity to changing interest rates, given the Bank’s business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors . The Bank does not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities. Mortgage World did not engage in hedging activities to cover the risks of interest rate movements while it held mortgages for sale. The then low mortgage interest rates and their limited volatility had effectively mitigated such risks. Net Interest Income Simulation Models . Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software that measures the Bank’s earnings through simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, the Bank has policy guidelines for earnings risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. As of June 30, 2022, in the event of an instantaneous upward and downward change in rates from management's interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated: Net Interest Income Year 1 Change Rate Shift (1) Year 1 Forecast from Level (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 59,359 (6.14%) +300 60,394 (4.50%) +200 61,447 (2.84%) +100 62,449 (1.26%) Level 63,243 —% -100 63,279 0.06% (1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. 73 Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The behavior of the deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in the projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the benefit in those scenarios. At June 30, 2022, the earnings simulation model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Economic Value of Equity Model . While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to net interest income, the Economic Value of Equity Model (“EVE”) measures estimated changes to the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. Rates are then shocked as prescribed by the Interest Rate Risk Policy to measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Interest Rate Risk Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At June 30, 2022, the EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: EVE as a Percentage of Present Value of Assets (3) Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Increase Change in Interest Estimated EVE EVE (Decrease) Rates (basis points) (1) EVE (2) Amount Percent Ratio (4) (basis points) (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 430,829 $ (108,480 ) (20.11 %) 23.04 % (2,011 ) +300 456,893 (82,416 ) (15.28 %) 23.90 % (1,528 ) +200 484,054 (55,255 ) (10.25 %) 24.76 % (1,025 ) +100 513,076 (26,233 ) (4.86 %) 25.65 % (486 ) Level 539,309 — — % 26.39 % — -100 564,148 24,839 4.61 % 27.04 % 461 (1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. (2) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. (3) Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets. (4) EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets. Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. At June 30, 2022, the EVE model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors’ approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Most Likely Earnings Simulation Models . Management also analyzes a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress the balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management and weighted to determine the most likely result. These processes assist management to better anticipate financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to review other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. 74 Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. The Asset/Liability Committee reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing and capital policies . Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in the Bank’s regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behaviors that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from the Bank’s historical studies of financial instruments and the best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into Bank’s asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare its results to other banks. The Asset/Liability Management Committee may determine that the Company should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and its conclusions regarding interest rate fluctuations in future periods. The historically low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response the turmoil resulting from COVID-19 pandemic is ending. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 2.25%-2.50% during its July 2022 meeting, the fourth consecutive rate hike, and pushing borrowing costs to the highest level since 2019. The Federal Reserve has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases during 2022. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. The Bank believes it is well positioned to withstand this rising interest rate environment in the near term as it is asset sensitive. GAP Analysis . In addition, management analyzes interest rate sensitivity by monitoring the Bank’s interest rate sensitivity ""gap."" The interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing-liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period, and a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period. The following table sets forth the Company’s interest-earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities at June 30, 2022, which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown based upon certain assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at June 30, 2022, on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments. The loan amounts in 75 the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable-rate loans.

Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and EVE tables presented assume that the composition of the interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income and EVE tables provide an indication of the interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and EVE and will differ from actual results. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table. Interest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of loans, deposits and borrowings. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity describes the ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Company’s customers and to fund current and future planned expenditures. The primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and available-for-sale securities and proceeds from the sale of loans. The Bank also has access to borrow from the FHLBNY. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bank had $334.4 million and $106.3 million, respectively, of term and overnight outstanding advances from the FHLBNY, and also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through letters of credit of up to $21.5 million, both as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there was eligible collateral of approximately $401.1 million and $362.3 million, respectively, in mortgage loans available to secure advances from the FHLBNY. The Bank also has an unsecured line of credit of $25.0 million with a correspondent bank, of which there was none outstanding at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Bank did not have any outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements with brokers as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, Mortgage World maintained two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans, with maximum credit lines of $30.0 million , of which $15.1 million was utilized, with $14.9 million remaining unused. As of June 30, 2022, Mortgage World was a division of the Bank and the Bank was funding these loans. Although maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The most liquid assets are cash and interest-bearing deposits in banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $26.5 million and $28.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations, purchases of new securities, and purchase of equipment offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed securities, and proceeds from the sale of real estate was $(286.6 million) and $(219.2 million) for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting of issuance of preferred stock, activities in deposit accounts, advances, contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation and repurchase and sale of shares as treasury stock, was $381.0 million and $184.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on the Company’s current assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and current global and regional market conditions on its borrowers, management has determined that these may be a detriment to borrowers’ ability to repay in the short-term and that the likelihood of long-term detrimental effects will depend significantly on the resolution of these factors and the resumption of normalized economic activities, a factor not yet determinable. The Bank’s management also took steps to enhance the Company’s liquidity position by increasing its on balance sheet cash and cash equivalents position in order to meet unforeseen liquidity events and to fund upcoming funding needs . At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, all regulatory capital requirements were met, resulting in the Company and the Bank being categorized as well capitalized at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change this categorization. Material Cash Requirements Commitments . As a financial services provider, the Company routinely is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. Although these contractual obligations represent the Company’s future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans originated. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans and extend credit of $270.5 million and $220.5 million, respectively. 77 It is anticipate d that the Company will have sufficient funds available to meet its current lending commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from June 30, 2022 totaled $ 2 1 2 . 0 million . Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing time deposits will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits are not retained, the Company may utilize FHLB NY advances, unsecured credit lines with correspondent banks, or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. Contractual Obligations . In the ordinary course of its operations, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. There have been no material changes in the Company’s material cash requirements under its contractual obligations as discussed in its most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Other Material Cash Requirements. In addition to contractual obligations, the Company’s material cash requirements also includes compensation and benefits expenses for its employees, which were $14.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The Company also has material cash requirements for occupancy and equipment expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization of $933,000, related to rental expenses, general maintenance and cleaning supplies, guard services, software licenses and other miscellaneous expenses, which were $5.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part I, Item 2 of this report under “Management of Market Risk”. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of June 30, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, there were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting. 78 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. The Company is not involved in any pending legal proceedings as a plaintiff or a defendant other than routine legal proceeding occurring in the ordinary course of business. At June 30, 2022, the Company was not involved in any legal proceedings the outcome of which management believes would be material to its financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our 2021 Form 10-K and the risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our other SEC filings, which could materially affect our businesses, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our Risk Factors from those disclosed in Item 1A of our 2021 Form 10-K or our other SEC filings. The Company’s net income and earnings per share for the first quarter of 2022 have been adversely affected by a significant write-off and write-down related to its relationship with Grain Technologies, Inc . The Company’s results may be further adversely affected as a result of its lending relationship with Grain. As discussed under Item 2, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations‎, Factors Affecting the Comparability of Results, Write-off and Write-Down of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has taken a significant write-off and write-down related to microloans originated by FinTech startup company Grain as a result of cyberfraud in the application for microloans originated by Grain. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, if a microloan originated by Grain is found to be fraudulent, becomes 120 days delinquent upon 120 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of ‎Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been ‎complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The ‎microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.”‎ During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company has assessed ‎the collectability of the remaining Grain Receivable and has determined that it is appropriate to write-off and write-down a $8.1 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company has assessed ‎the collectability of the remaining Grain Receivable and has determined that it is appropriate to further write-off $1.5 million resulting in a total write-off $9.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The Company continues to closely monitor its portfolio of consumer loans originated by Grain as well as Grain’s refinement of ‎solutions for detecting and preventing cyber fraud in the application for microloans. The Company has requested, and Grain has ‎agreed, that no new microloans be originated until further notice and that further extensions of credit to an existing microloan ‎borrower only be made upon confirmation that such borrower is not fraudulent. The Company also evaluates on a monthly basis the ‎likelihood that Grain will be able to make payments on the Grain Receivable. If, as a result of its continuing evaluation, the ‎Company determines that Grain will not be able to make timely payments on the Grain Receivable or additional Grain originated ‎microloans are found to be fraudulent, the Bank may be required to write-off some or all of the remaining value of the Grain ‎Receivable, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. Further, like other start-up companies, there is a higher level ‎of risk that Grain may not be able to execute its business plan and may fail. In the event Grain were to cease operations, and ‎although it has considered contingency plans, the Bank may have greater difficulty in servicing and collecting the microloan ‎portfolio. In such a case, the level the Bank has provided for in its allowance for loan losses for its microloan portfolio may be ‎inadequate and it may need to increase its provision for loan losses, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. As a ‎consequence of such events the Bank may determine it appropriate to terminate its relationship with Grain and the value of the ‎Company’s $1.0 million equity investment in Grain could become impaired.‎ Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. Except as discussed below with respect to the Preferred Stock (as defined below), there were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. On June 7, 2022, the Company issued 225,000 shares of Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A‎, par value $0.01 (the “Preferred Stock”) for the capital investment of $225.0 million from the Treasury under the ECIP.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Consolidation: Ponce Financial Group, Inc., as the successor by merger with PDL Community Bancorp pursuant to the completion of the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from the mutual holding company to the stock holding company form of organization that was effective on January 27, 2022 (hereafter referred to as “we,” “our,” “us,” “Ponce Financial Group, Inc.,” or the “Company”), is the holding company of Ponce Bank (“Ponce Bank” or the “Bank”), a federally chartered stock savings association. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary Ponce Bank (the “Bank”) and the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Ponce De Leon Mortgage Corp., which is a mortgage banking entity. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Nature of Operations: The Company is a savings and loan holding company. The Company is subject to the regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Company’s business is conducted through the administrative office and 13 full service banking and 4 mortgage loan offices. The banking offices are located in New York City – the Bronx ( 4 branches), Manhattan ( 2 branches), Queens ( 3 branches), Brooklyn ( 3 branches) and Union City ( 1 branch), New Jersey. The mortgage loan offices are located in Queens ( 2 ) and Brooklyn ( 1 ), New York and Bergenfield ( 1 ), New Jersey. The Company’s primary market area currently consists of the New York City metropolitan area. The Bank is a federally chartered stock savings association headquartered in the Bronx, New York. It was originally chartered in 1960 as a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association under the name Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1985, the Bank changed its name to “Ponce De Leon Federal Savings Bank.” In 1997, the Bank changed its name again to “Ponce De Leon Federal Bank.” Upon the completion of its reorganization into a mutual holding company structure in September of 2017, the assets and liabilities of Ponce De Leon Federal Bank were transferred to and assumed by the Bank. The Bank is a Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), a Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”), and a certified Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lender. The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). The Bank’s business primarily consists of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in mortgage loans, consisting of one-to-four family residential (both investor-owned and owner-occupied), multifamily residential, nonresidential properties and construction and land, and, to a lesser extent, in business and consumer loans. The Bank also invests in securities, which have historically consisted of U.S. government and federal agency securities and securities issued by government-sponsored or owned enterprises, mortgage-backed securities and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the “FHLBNY”) stock. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts, including demand, savings, money markets and certificates of deposit accounts. On July 10, 2020 , the Company completed its acquisition of Mortgage World Bankers, Inc. (“Mortgage World”). During the year ended December 31, 2021, Mortgage World was a mortgage banking entity subject to the regulation and examination of the New York State Department of Financial Services. The primary business of Mortgage World was the taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they were sold to investors. Although Mortgage World was permitted to do business in various states (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and Connecticut), it primarily operated in the New York City metropolitan area. On January 26, 2022, Mortgage World transferred its assets and liabilities to Ponce Bank and ceased operating as an independent mortgage banking entity. Mortgage World’s business is now conducted as a division of Ponce Bank. Risks and Uncertainties: On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched significant military action against Ukraine, and sustained conflict and disruption in the region is possible. The impact to Ukraine as well as actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions imposed by Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U.S. and other countries and companies and organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Russia, and actions taken by Russia in response to such sanctions, and each country’s potential response to such sanctions, tensions, and military actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 6 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic continues to disrupt the global and U.S. economies and as well as the lives of individuals throughout the world. The New York City Metropolitan area continues to experience, although to a much lesser extent, cases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments, businesses, and the public are still taking actions to address the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and to mitigate its effects, including vaccinations and masking. The financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely impact several industries within our geographic footprint and impair the ability of the Company’s customers to fulfill their contractual obligations to the Company. This could cause the Company to experience adverse effects on its business operations, loan portfolio, financial condition, and results of operations. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the provision for loan losses amounted to $ 1.3 million primarily due to increases in qualitative reserves as the Company continues to assess the economic impacts the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and increase in interest rates has on our local economy and our loan portfolio. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Use of Estimates : In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, the valuation of loans held for sale, the valuation of deferred tax assets and investment securities and the estimates relating to the valuation for share-based awards. Interim Financial Statements : The interim consolidated financial statements at March 31, 2022, and for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 are unaudited and reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2022, or any other period. Significant Group Concentrations of Credit Risk : Most of the Bank's activities are with customers located within New York City. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the Bank's loan portfolio and Mortgage World’s, a division of the Bank, ability to sell originated loans in the secondary markets are susceptible to changes in the local market conditions. Note 4 discusses the types of securities that the Bank invests in. Notes 5 and 12 discuss the types of lending that the Bank engages in, and other concentrations. Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts due from banks (including items in process of clearing). For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash flows from loans originated by the Company, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions, and deposits are reported net. Included in cash and cash equivalents are restricted cash from escrows and good faith deposits. Escrows consist of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) upfront mortgage insurance premiums and escrows on unsold mortgages that are held on behalf of borrowers. Good faith deposits consist of deposits received from commercial loan customers for use in various disbursements relating to the closing of a commercial loan. Restricted cash are included in cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows. Securities : Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the date individual investment securities are acquired, and the appropriateness of such classification is reassessed at each statement of financial condition date. Debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, if any, are classified as ""held-to-maturity"" and recorded at amortized cost. Trading securities, if any, are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings. Securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading, are classified as ""available-for-sale"" and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. 7 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: 1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and 2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. The credit loss is defined as the difference between the discounted present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. For equity securities, the entire amount of impairment is recognized through earnings. Gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific-identification method. The sale of a held-to-maturity security within three months of its maturity date or after collection of at least 85 % of the principal outstanding at the time the security was acquired is considered a maturity for purposes of classification and disclosure. Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock : The Bank is a member of the FHLBNY. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. FHLBNY stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. Loans Receivable : Loans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at current unpaid principal balances, net of the allowance for loan losses and including net deferred loan origination fees and costs. Interest income is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the interest method without anticipating prepayments. A loan is moved to nonaccrual status in accordance with the Company’s policy typically after 90 days of non-payment. The accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is generally discontinued at the time the loan becomes 90 days past due unless the loan is well-secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than 120 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All nonaccrual loans are considered impaired loans. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual are reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash basis or recorded against principal balances, until qualifying for return to accrual. Cash basis interest recognition is only applied on nonaccrual loans with a sufficient collateral margin to ensure no doubt with respect to the collectability of principal. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and remain current for a period of time (typically six months) and future payments are reasonably assured. Accrued interest receivable is closely monitored for collectability and will be charged-off in a timely manner if deemed uncollectable. Allowance for Loan Losses : The allowance for loan losses (“ALLL”) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged-off. The Company’s assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and interest rates on borrowers indicates that it is likely that it will be a detriment to their ability to repay in the short-term and that the likelihood of long-term detrimental effects depends significantly on the resumption of normalized economic activities, a factor not yet determinable. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. 8 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Impaired loans are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral, present value of cash flows, or the observable market price of the note. Impairment measurement for all collateral dependent loans, excluding accruing troubled debt restructurings, is based on the fair value of collateral, less costs to sell, if necessary. A loan is considered collateral dependent if repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the sale or the operation of the underlying collateral. When a loan is modified to troubled debt restructuring, management evaluates for any possible impairment using either the discounted cash flows method, where the value of the modified loan is based on the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, or by using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs, if repayment under the modified terms becomes doubtful. The general component covers non‑impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced over a rolling 12 quarter average period. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These economic factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and, effects of changes in credit concentrations. When establishing the allowance for loan losses, management categorizes loans into risk categories reflecting individual borrower earnings, liquidity, leverage and cash flow, as well as the nature of underlying collateral. These risk categories and relevant risk characteristics are as follows: Residential and Multifamily Mortgage Loans : Residential and multifamily mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages. These loans are typically underwritten with loan-to-value ratios ranging from 65 % to 90 %. The primary risks involved in residential mortgages are the borrower’s loss of employment, or other significant event, that negatively impacts the source of repayment. Additionally, a serious decline in home values could jeopardize repayment in the event that the underlying collateral needs to be liquidated to pay-off the loan. Nonresidential Mortgage Loans : Nonresidential mortgage loans are primarily secured by commercial buildings, office and industrial buildings, warehouses, small retail shopping centers and various special purpose properties, including hotels, restaurants and nursing homes. These loans are typically underwritten at no more than 75 % loan-to-value ratio. Although terms vary, commercial real estate loans generally have amortization periods of 15 to 30 years , as well as balloon payments of 10 to 15 years , and terms which provide that the interest rates are adjusted on a 5 -year schedule. Construction and Land Loans : Construction real estate loans consist of vacant land and property that is in the process of improvement. Repayment of these loans can be dependent on the sale of the property to third parties or the successful completion of the improvements by the builder for the end user. In the event a loan is made on property that is not yet improved for the planned development, there is the risk that government approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Construction loans also run the risk that improvements will not be completed on time or in accordance with specifications and projected costs. Construction real estate loans generally have terms of six months to two years during the construction period with fixed rates or interest rates based on a designated index. Business Loans : Business loans are loans for commercial, corporate and business purposes, including issuing letters of credit. These loans are secured by business assets or may be unsecured and repayment is directly dependent on the successful operation of the borrower’s business and the borrower’s ability to convert the assets to operating revenue. They possess greater risk than most other types of loans because the repayment capacity of the borrower may become inadequate. Business loans generally have terms of five to seven years or less and interest rates that float in accordance with a designated published index. Substantially, all such loans are backed by the personal guarantees of the owners of the business. Consumer Loans : Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates than mortgage loans. The risk involved in consumer loans is the type and nature of the collateral and, in certain cases, the absence of collateral. Consumer loans include passbook loans and other secured and unsecured loans that have been made for a variety of consumer purposes. Included in consumer loans are loans related to Grain. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value : Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, include residential mortgages that were originated in accordance with secondary market pricing and underwriting standards. These loans are loans originated by the Bank’s Mortgage World division and the Company intends to sell these loans on the secondary market. Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. The gains or losses for the changes in fair value of these loans are included in income on sale of mortgage loans on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale measured under the fair value option is calculated based on the principal amount of the loan and is included in interest loans receivable on the consolidated statements of operations . Derivative Financial Instruments : The Company, through the Bank’s Mortgage World division, uses derivative financial instruments as a part of its price risk management activities. All such derivative financial instruments are designated as free-standing derivative instruments. In accordance with FASB ASC 815-25, Derivatives and Hedging , all derivative instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their fair value. Change in the fair value of these derivatives is reported in current period earnings. 9 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Additionally, to facilitate the sale of mortgage loans, the Bank, through its Mortgage World division, may enter into forward sale positions on securities, and mandatory delivery positions. Exposure to losses or gains on these positions is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid. As of March 31, 2022, the Company did not enter into any forward sale or mandatory delivery positions on their financial instruments. Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The Company’s revenue from contracts with customers in the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contract with Customers , is recognized within noninterest income. ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Management determined the revenue streams impacted by ASC 606 included those related to service charges on deposit accounts, ATM and card fees and other services fees. The Company’s revenue recognition pattern for these revenue streams did not change from current practice. The Company's primary sources of revenue are interest income on financial assets and income from mortgage banking activities, which are explicitly excluded from the scope of ASC 606. COVID-19 Pandemic and the CARES Act: On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law. Section 4013 of the CARES Act, “Temporary Relief from Troubled Debt Restructurings,” provides banks the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings (“TDR”) for a limited period of time to account for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, on April 7, 2020, the banking agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, issued a statement, “Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working With Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised)” (“Interagency Statement”), to encourage banks to work prudently with borrowers and to describe the agencies’ interpretation of how accounting rules under ASC 310-40, “Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors,” apply to certain of the COVID-19 pandemic related modifications. Further, on August 3, 2020, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council issued a Joint Statement on Additional Loan Accommodations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, to provide prudent risk management and consumer protection principles for financial institutions to consider while working with borrowers as loans near the end of initial loan accommodation periods. Under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, modifications of loan terms do not automatically result in TDRs and the Company generally does not need to categorize the COVID-19 pandemic-related modifications as TDRs. The Company may elect not to categorize loan modifications as TDRs if they are (1) related to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (A) 60 days after the date of termination of the National Emergency or (B) December 31, 2020. This relief was extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act enacted on December 27, 2020 to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the termination of the national emergency. This relief was not extended beyond January 1, 2022 and the Bank has made appropriate adjustments which are not material. Federal banking agencies were required to defer to the determination of the banks making such election. This includes short-term (e.g., six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. Borrowers considered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented. Financial institutions accounting for eligible loans under Section 4013 are not required to apply ASC Subtopic 310-40 to the Section 4013 loans for the term of the loan modification. Financial institutions do not have to report Section 4013 loans as TDRs in regulatory reports, including this Form 10-K. The Company has chosen to utilize this section of the CARES Act and does not report the COVID-19 pandemic related modifications as TDRs. Transfers of Financial Assets : Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when all of the components meet the definition of a participating interest and when control over the assets has been surrendered. A participating interest generally represents (1) a proportionate (pro rata) ownership interest in an entire financial asset, (2) a relationship where from the date of transfer all cash flows received from the entire financial asset are divided proportionately among the participating interest holders in an amount equal to their share of ownership, (3) the priority of cash flows has certain characteristics, including no reduction in priority, subordination of interest, or recourse to the transferor other than standard representation or warranties, and (4) no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Bank, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Bank does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either (a) an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity or (b) the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a clean-up call. 10 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Premises and Equipment : Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed and charged to operations using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows: Years Buildings 39 Building improvements 15 - 39 Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 3 - 10 Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated economic lives or the related lease terms, including extensions expected to be exercised. Gains and losses on dispositions are recognized upon realization. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and improvements are capitalized. Leasehold improvements in process are not amortized until the assets are placed in operation. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets : Long-lived assets, including premises and leasehold improvements, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated by that review, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to noninterest expense. Other Real Estate Owned : Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) represents properties acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure or other proceedings. OREO is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated disposal costs, at the date of foreclosure, which establishes a new cost basis. After foreclosure, the properties are held for sale and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs of disposal. Any write-down to fair value, at the time of transfer to OREO, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Properties are evaluated regularly to ensure that the recorded amounts are supported by current fair values and charges against earnings are recorded as necessary to reduce the carrying amount to fair value, less estimated costs to dispose. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property are capitalized, subject to the limit of fair value of the OREO, while costs relating to holding the property are expensed. Gains or losses are included in operations upon disposal. Income Taxes : The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income, in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 % likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, would be classified as additional provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. Related Party Transactions : Directors and officers of the Company and their affiliates have been customers of and have had transactions with the Company, and it is expected that such persons will continue to have such transactions in the future. Management believes that all deposit accounts, loans, services and commitments comprising such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other customers who are not directors or officers. In the opinion of management, the transactions with related parties did not involve more than normal risk of collectability, nor favored treatment or terms, nor present other unfavorable features. Note 16 contains details regarding related party transactions. 11 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans: The Company maintains a KSOP, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) provisions incorporated, a Long-Term Incentive Plan that includes grants of restricted stock units and stock options, and a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”). KSOP, the Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions: Compensation expense is recorded as shares are committed to be released with a corresponding credit to unearned KSOP equity account at the average fair market value of the shares during the period and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the service period based upon management’s estimate of the number of shares expected to be allocated by the KSOP. The difference between the average fair market value and the cost of the shares allocated by the KSOP is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in-capital. Unallocated common shares held by the Company’s KSOP are shown as a reduction in stockholders’ equity and are excluded from weighted-average common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted earnings per share calculations until they are committed to be released. The 401(k) provisions provide for elective employee/participant deferrals of income. Discretionary matching, profit-sharing, and safe harbor contributions, not to exceed 4 % of employee compensation and profit-sharing contributions may be provided. Stock Options: The Company recognizes the value of shared-based payment transactions as compensation costs in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. The fair value of the share-based payments for stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur during the period. Restricted Stock Units: The Company recognizes compensation cost related to restricted stock units based on the market price of the stock units at the grant date over the vesting period. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determines the fair value of restricted stock units. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Comprehensive Income (Loss): Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss), which are both recognized as separate components of stockholder’s equity. Other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale. Loss Contingencies : Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are any such matters that will have a material effect on the operations and financial position of the Company. Fair Value of Financial Instruments : Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in Note 13. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates. Segment Reporting : The Company has two reportable segments: the Bank and, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, Mortgage World, and for the three months ended March 31, 2022, Mortgage World as a division of the Bank. Income from the Bank consists primarily of interest and fees earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts. Income from Mortgage World consists primarily of taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they are sold to investors. Loan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments : Financial instruments include off‑balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. Earnings (Loss) per Share (“EPS”) : Basic EPS represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding, plus the effect of potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Basic weighted common shares outstanding is weighted average common shares outstanding less weighted average unallocated ESOP shares. Treasury Stock : Shares repurchased under the Company’s share repurchase programs were purchased in open-market transactions and are held as treasury stock. The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of stockholders’ equity. Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation : Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reporting results of operations and did not affect previously reported amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations . 12 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements: As an emerging growth company (“EGC”) as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, the Company has elected to use the extended transition period to delay the adoption of new or reissued accounting pronouncements applicable to public business entities until such pronouncements are made applicable to nonpublic business entities. The Company will be exiting the EGC status as of December 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2022, there is no significant difference in the comparability of the consolidated financial statements as a result of this extended transition period. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” This ASU requires all lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset, measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, at the lease commencement date. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged under the new guidance. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, for public business entities. As the Company is taking advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards assuming it remains an EGC, it will adopt the amendments in this update for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company has begun its evaluation of the amended guidance including the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. To date, the Company has identified its leased office spaces as within the scope of the guidance. The Company currently leases its administrative office and 16 branches and mortgage offices and the new guidance will result in the establishment of a right to use asset and corresponding lease obligations. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance, including determining whether other contracts exist that are deemed to be in scope and subsequent related accounting standard updates. The Company has established a project committee and has initiated training on ASU 2016-02. The Company is performing preliminary computations of its right to use asset and corresponding lease obligations for the operating leases of its administrative office and 16 leased branches and mortgage offices. The Company is utilizing a new lease accounting tool to assist in the computations of its right to use asset and corresponding lease obligations for the operating leases. The Company will adopt this standard at the end of December 2022 and anticipates recognizing approximately $ 34.3 million of right of use asset and approximately $ 35.5 million of operating lease liability. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “ Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This ASU significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The standard is to replace today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model. The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model, is to apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments and financial guarantees. The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities. For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. As a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time, as they do today. The ASU also reportedly simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt, securities and loans. ASU 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity’s assumptions, models and methods for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, entities will need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, for public business entities, that are not deemed to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC as of November 15, 2019. As the Company is taking advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards assuming it remains an EGC, it will adopt the amendments in this update for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities have to apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach). Although early adoption is permitted, the Company does not expect to elect that option. The Company has begun its evaluation of the amended guidance including the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. As a result of the required change in approach toward determining estimated credit losses from the current “incurred loss” model to one based on estimated cash flows over a loan’s contractual life, adjusted for prepayments (a “life of loan” model), the Company expects that the new guidance will result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses, particularly for longer duration loan portfolios. The Company also expects that the new guidance may result in an allowance for available-for-sale debt securities. The Company has selected the CECL model and has begun running scenarios. In both cases, the extent of the change is indeterminable at this time as it will be dependent upon portfolio composition and credit quality at the adoption date, as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. 13 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) . ” This ASU provides optional means and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or other reference rates expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company believes this update will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2. Plan of Conversion and Stock Offering On May 25 , 2021, Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company and PDL Community Bancorp, the then holding company for Ponce Bank and Mortgage World Bankers, Inc., announced that their Boards of Directors had unanimously adopted a Plan of Conversion and Reorganization (the “Plan”) pursuant to which Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company and PDL Community Bancorp reorganized into a new stock holding company and conducted a second-step stock offering of new shares of common stock . On January 26, 2022, Mortgage World transferred its assets and liabilities to Ponce Bank and ceased operating as an independent mortgage banking entity. Mortgage World’s business is now conducted as a division of Ponce Bank. On January 27, 2022, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and PDL Community Bancorp announced that the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from the mutual to stock form of organization and related stock offering was consummated at the close of business. As a result of the closing of the conversion and reorganization and stock offering, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. is now the holding company for Ponce Bank. Ponce Bank’s former mutual holding companies, PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, have ceased to exist. PDL Community Bancorp’s stock ceased trading at the close of the market on January 27, 2022. Ponce Financial Group, Inc.’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the same trading symbol “PDLB” on January 28, 2022. As a result of the conversion and reorganization, each issued and outstanding share of PDL Community Bancorp common stock was converted into the right to receive 1.3952 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. Cash was paid in lieu of any fractional shares based on the sale price in the offering of $ 10.00 per share. Ponce Financial Group Inc.’s total issued and outstanding shares on January 28, 2022 was 24,711,834 shares. All shares of treasury stock of PDL Community Bancorp were eliminated on January 27, 2022. At December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents included $ 122.0 million received in connection with the conversion and reorganization and was reflected as a separate liability on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. As of January 27, 2022, these funds were reclassified as proceeds from the sale of the Company’s common stock. On January 27, 2022, the Company made a $ 5.0 million contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation as part of the conversion and reorganization, which is included in the non-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Note 3 . Restrictions on Cash and Due from Banks The Bank was previously required to maintain reserve balances in cash or on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank, based on a percentage of deposits. Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board eliminated reserve requirement for depository institutions to support lending to households and businesses. 14 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 4 .

Available-for-Sale Securities (Continued) The Company’s investment portfolio had 42 and 29 available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and one held-to-maturity security at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had 38 and 23 available-for-sale securities, respectively , and one held-to-maturity security at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 with gross unrealized loss positions. Management reviewed the financial condition of the entities underlying the securities at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and determined that they are not other than temporarily impaired because the unrealized losses in those securities relate to market interest rate changes. The Company has the ability to hold them and does not have the intent to sell these securities, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities, before recovery of the cost basis. In addition, management also considers the issuers of the securities to be financially sound and believes the Company will receive all contractual principal and interest related to these investments. The following is a summary of maturities of securities at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Amounts are shown by contractual maturity. Because borrowers for mortgage-backed securities have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties, at any time, these securities are included as a total within the table.

Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses Loans receivable at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are summarized as follows: March 31, December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential Investor-Owned $ 323,442 $ 317,304 Owner-Occupied 95,234 96,947 Multifamily residential 368,133 348,300 Nonresidential properties 251,893 239,691 Construction and land 144,881 134,651 Total mortgage loans 1,183,583 1,136,893 Nonmortgage loans: Business loans (1) 100,253 150,512 Consumer loans (2) 31,899 34,693 Total non-mortgage loans 132,152 185,205 Total loans, gross 1,315,735 1,322,098 Net deferred loan origination costs 1,604 ( 668 ) Allowance for loan losses ( 16,893 ) ( 16,352 ) Loans receivable, net $ 1,300,446 $ 1,305,078 (1) As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, business loans include $ 86.0 million and $ 136.8 million, respectively, of SBA Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans. (2) As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, consumer loans include $ 31.0 million and $ 33.9 million, respectively, of microloans originated by the Bank through a mobile application of Grain Technologies, LLC (“Grain”) that is geared to the underbanked and new generations entering the financial services market and uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies . The Company’s lending activities are conducted principally in metropolitan New York City. The Company primarily grants loans secured by real estate to individuals and businesses pursuant to an established credit policy applicable to each type of lending activity in which it engages. Although collateral provides assurance as a secondary source of repayment, the Company ordinarily requires the primary source of repayment to be based on the borrowers’ ability to generate continuing cash flows. The Company also evaluates the collateral and creditworthiness of each customer. The credit policy provides that depending on the borrowers’ creditworthiness and type of collateral, credit may be extended up to predetermined percentages of the market value of the collateral or on an unsecured basis. Real estate is the primary form of collateral. Other important forms of collateral are time deposits and marketable securities. For disclosures related to the allowance for loan losses and credit quality, the Company does not have any disaggregated classes of loans below the segment level. Credit-Quality Indicators : Internally assigned risk ratings are used as credit-quality indicators, which are reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. The objectives of the Company’s risk-rating system are to provide the Board of Directors and senior management with an objective assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio, to promptly and accurately identify loans with well-defined credit weaknesses so that timely action can be taken to minimize credit loss, to identify relevant trends affecting the collectability of the loan portfolio, to isolate potential problem areas and to provide essential information for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. 19 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 5. Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses (Continued) Below are the definitions of the internally assigned risk ratings: • Strong Pass – Loans to a new or existing borrower collateralized at least 90 percent by an unimpaired deposit account at the Company. • Good Pass – Loans to a new or existing borrower in a well-established enterprise in excellent financial condition with strong liquidity and a history of consistently high level of earnings, cash flow and debt service capacity. • Satisfactory Pass – Loans to a new or existing borrower of average strength with acceptable financial condition, satisfactory record of earnings and sufficient historical and projected cash flow to service the debt. • Performance Pass – Existing loans that evidence strong payment history but document less than average strength, financial condition, record of earnings, or projected cash flows with which to service the debt. • Special Mention – Loans in this category are currently protected but show one or more potential weaknesses and risks which may inadequately protect collectability or borrower’s ability to meet repayment terms at some future date if the weakness or weaknesses are not monitored or remediated. • Substandard – Loans that are inadequately protected by the repayment capacity of the borrower or the current sound net worth of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans in this category have well defined weaknesses and risks that jeopardize the repayment. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss may be sustained if the deficiencies are not remediated. • Doubtful – Loans that have all the weaknesses of loans classified as “Substandard” with the added characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans within the top four categories above are considered pass rated, as commonly defined. Risk ratings are assigned as necessary to differentiate risk within the portfolio.

Impaired loans, including troubled debt restructurings, are identified by applying normal loan review procedures in accordance with the allowance for loan losses methodology. Management periodically assesses loans to determine whether impairment exists. Any loan that is, or will potentially be, no longer performing in accordance with the terms of the original loan contract is evaluated to determine impairment. 24 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 5 .

Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses (Continued) The loan portfolio also includes certain loans that have been modified to troubled debt restructurings. Under applicable standards, loans are modified to troubled debt restructurings when a creditor, for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor’s financial condition, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider, unless it results in a delay in payment that is insignificant. These concessions could include a reduction of interest rate on the loan, payment and maturity extensions, forbearance, or other actions intended to maximize collections. When a loan is modified to a troubled debt restructuring, management evaluates for any possible impairment using either the discounted cash flows method, where the value of the modified loan is based on the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, or by using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs if repayment under the modified terms becomes doubtful. If management determines that the value of the modified loan in a troubled debt restructuring is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized through a specific allowance estimate or charge-off against the allowance for loan losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, and for the year ended December 31, 2021, there were no loans restructured as a troubled debt restructuring. At March 31, 2022, there were 28 troubled debt restructured loans totaling $ 7.8 million of which $ 5.3 million are on accrual status. At December 31, 2021, there were 30 troubled debt restructured loans totaling $ 8.7 million of which $ 6.2 million are on accrual status. There were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. The financial impact from the concessions made represents specific impairment reserves on these loans, which aggregated to $ 245,000 and $ 243,000 at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale at Fair Value At March 31, 2022 and at December 31, 2021, 14 loans and 27 loans related to Mortgage World in the amount of $ 8.0 million and $ 15.5 million, respectively, were held for sale and accounted for under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. Write-off and write-down of Microloans In 2020, the Company entered in a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain Technologies, Inc. (“Grain”). Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to $ 1,000 and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originates and services these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan is found to be fraudulent, becomes 120 days delinquent upon 120 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.” The Bank, pursuant to its agreement with Grain, at December 31, 2021, had 59,180 microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with credit extensions aggregating $ 33.9 million. Of these microloans, the Bank estimates that 80 percent have been made in low- and low-to-moderate income census tracts with an estimated 56 percent made to minority borrowers. At March 31, 2022, the Bank had 54,247 microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $ 31.0 million and which were performing, in management’s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios. Under the agreement with the Bank, Grain earns origination and servicing fees based on the Bank’s earnings from the microloans. Since the beginning of its agreement with Grain through March 31, 2022, 24,719 microloans amounting to $ 17.0 million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain, of which, as of March 31, 2022, $ 11.8 million remain outstanding in the Grain Receivable (inclusive of a $ 1.8 million reserve established as of December 31, 2021 by the Bank using a $ 1.8 million grant received from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Rapid Response Program to reduce the Grain Receivable at December 31, 2021 to $ 8.5 million, an amount management considered collectible at the time under the facts and circumstances then known). Based on further investigation, evaluation and financial analysis during the first quarter of 2022, the Company has assessed the collectability of the $ 11.8 million remaining Grain receivable and has determined that it is appropriate to write-off approximately $ 6.3 million and provide for an additional reserve of $ 1.7 million, after applying a $ 1.6 million security deposit set-off, leaving a net Grain Receivable balance of $ 2.2 million at March 31, 2022. 26 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 5.

Warehouse Lines of Credit: Mortgage World maintained two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the originations and sale of residential mortgages. The lines of credit were repaid with proceeds from the sale of the mortgage loans. The lines were secured by the assets collateralizing underlying mortgages. The agreements with the warehouse lenders provide for certain restrictive covenants such as minimum net worth and liquidity ratios for Mortgage World. As of December 31, 2021, Mortgage World was in full compliance with all financial covenants. 28 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 8. Borrowings (Continued) Warehouse Line of Credit #1 The interest rate is based on the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 3.25 %. The effective rate as of March 31, 2022 was 3.70 % and the effective rate as of December 31, 2021 was 3.35 %. The line of credit is an evergreen agreement that terminates upon request by either the financial institution or the borrower. Warehouse Line of Credit #2 The interest rate is based on the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 3.00 % for loans funded. The effective rate as of December 31, 2020 was 3.10 %.

This liability is presented at cost and fully offsets the principal balance of the related loans included in mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value on the consolidated statement of financial condition. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were no mortgage loan funding payable for both periods. Note 9 . Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 consists of the following: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Federal: Current $ ( 1,053 ) $ 560 Deferred ( 1,715 ) 36 ( 2,768 ) 596 State and local: Current 195 68 Deferred ( 543 ) 310 ( 348 ) 378 Valuation allowance 168 ( 242 ) (Benefit) provision for income taxes $ ( 2,948 ) $ 732 29 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 9. Income Taxes (Continued) Total income tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21 % for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to income before income taxes as a result of the following: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Income tax, at federal rate $ ( 2,051 ) $ 669 State and local tax, net of federal taxes ( 275 ) 299 Valuation allowance, net of the federal benefit 168 ( 242 ) Other ( 790 ) 6 $ ( 2,948 ) $ 732 Management maintains a valuation allowance against its net New York State and New York City deferred tax assets as it is unlikely these deferred tax assets will be utilized to reduce the Company's tax liability in future years. The valuation allowance increased by $ 168,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and decreased by $ 242,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Management has determined that it is not required to establish a valuation allowance against any other deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully utilized in future periods. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers the scheduled reversal of the deferred tax liabilities, the level of historical taxable income, and the projected future taxable income over the periods that the temporary differences comprising the deferred tax assets will be deductible. For federal income tax purposes, a financial institution may carry net operating losses (“NOLs”) to forward tax years indefinitely. The use of NOLs to offset income is limited to 80 %. The CARES Act allows NOLs generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding tax years. The Company did not generate NOLs in 2018, 2019 or 2020 so no carryback is available. At March 31, 2022, the Company had no federal NOLs carryforwards. The state and city of New York allow for a three-year carryback period and carryforward period of twenty years on NOLs generated on or after tax year 2015. For tax years prior to 2015, no carryback period is allowed. Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, has pre-2015 carryforwards of $ 572,000 for New York State purposes and $ 528,000 for New York City purposes. Furthermore, there are post-2015 carryforwards available of $ 34.9 million for New York State purposes and $ 15.0 million for New York City purposes. Finally, for New Jersey purposes, losses may only be carried forward 20 years, with no allowable carryback period. At March 31, 2022, the Bank had a federal NOLs carryforward of $ 5.7 million and no New Jersey NOLs carryforwards. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits recorded. The Company does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase in the next twelve months. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax, New York State income tax, Connecticut income tax, New Jersey income tax, Florida income tax, Pennsylvania income tax and New York City income tax. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2018. 30 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 9. Income Taxes (Continued) The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are presented below: March 31, December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan losses $ 5,428 $ 5,254 Deferred loan fees — 214 Interest on nonaccrual loans 154 102 Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities 1,929 399 Amortization of intangible assets 45 50 Deferred rent payable 181 152 Net operating losses 4,557 3,280 Charitable contribution carryforward 1,621 366 Compensation and benefits 666 456 Other 259 264 Total gross deferred tax assets 14,840 10,537 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation of premises and equipment 1,301 1,301 Deferred loan fees 515 — Other 63 63 Total gross deferred tax liabilities 1,879 1,364 Valuation allowance 5,521 5,353 Net deferred tax assets $ 7,440 $ 3,820 Note 10 . Compensation and Benefit Plans Ponce Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions (the “KSOP”) . Effective January 1, 2021, Ponce Bank amended and restated the terms of the Ponce Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “ESOP”) and merged the Ponce Bank 401(k) Plan into the ESOP to form the KSOP. There were no changes to the provisions of the ESOP as discussed below. The KSOP is for eligible employees of Ponce Bank and those of its affiliates. The named executive officers are eligible to participate in the KSOP just like other employees. An employee must attain the age of 21 and will be eligible to participate in the 401(k) features of the KSOP in the quarter following thirty days of service and the ESOP feature of the KSOP upon the first entry date commencing on or after the eligible employee’s completion of one year of service. Employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan at the beginning of each quarter (January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1). 401(k) Component : Under the 401(k) features of the KSOP (“401(k) Component”), a participant may elect to defer, on a pre-tax basis, the maximum amount as permitted by the Internal Revenue Code. For 2022, the salary deferral contribution limit was $ 20,500 ; provided, however, that a participant over age 50 may contribute an additional $ 6,500 to the 401(k) for a total of $ 27,000 . In addition to salary deferral contributions, Ponce Bank may make discretionary matching contributions, discretionary profit sharing contributions or safe harbor contributions to the 401(k) Component. Discretionary matching contributions are allocated on the basis of salary deferral contributions. Discretionary profit sharing contributions are based on three classifications set forth in the 401(k) feature (i) Class A — Chairman, President, and Executive Vice Presidents; (ii) Class B — Senior Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents and Assistant Vice Presidents; and (iii) Class C — all other eligible employees. The contribution for a class will be the same percentage of compensation for all participants in that class. If Ponce Bank decides to make a safe harbor contribution for a plan year, each participant will receive a contribution equal to 3 % of his or her compensation for the plan year. The 401(k) expenses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations amounted to $ 96,000 and $ 87,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 31 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 10. Compensation and Benefit Plans (Continued) A participant is always 100 % vested in his or her salary deferral contributions and safe harbor contributions. Discretionary matching and profit sharing contributions are 20 % vested after two years of service, plus an additional 20 % for each additional year of service; so all participants are fully vested in such contributions after six years of service. Participants also will become fully vested in his or her account balance in the 401(k) Component automatically upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the KSOP. Generally, participants will receive distributions from the KSOP upon separation from service in accordance with the terms of the governing document. ESOP Component: On September 29, 2017, in connection with the Bank’s reorganization into the mutual holding company form of organization, the ESOP trustee purchased, on behalf of the ESOP, 723,751 shares of PDL Community Bancorp common stock . The ESOP funded its stock purchase with a loan (“First ESOP loan”) from PDL Community Bancorp in the amount of $ 7.2 million, which was equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The First ESOP loan is being repaid principally through Ponce Bank’s contributions to the ESOP over the 15-year term of such loan. The interest rate for the First ESOP loan is 2.60 %. On January 27, 2022, concurrent with the completion of the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from a mutual form to a stock form of organization and the merger of PDL Community Bancorp with and into Ponce Financial Group, Inc., the shares of PDL Community Bancorp common stock held by the KSOP were converted into 977,880 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. On January 27, 2022, the KSOP trustee purchased, on behalf of the ESOP feature of the KSOP (“ESOP Component”), an additional 1,097,353 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock, or 4.44 % of the total number of shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock outstanding on January 27, 2022 (including shares issued to the Foundation). The KSOP funded this stock purchase with a loan (“Second ESOP loan”) from Ponce Financial Group, Inc. in the amount of $ 11.0 million, which was equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The Second ESOP loan is being repaid principally through Ponce Bank’s contributions to the ESOP Component over the 15-year term of such loan. The interest rate for the Second ESOP loan is 1.822 %. The trustee of the trust funding the KSOP holds the shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock purchased by the KSOP in an unallocated suspense account, and shares will be released from the suspense account on a pro-rata basis as the loans are repaid. The trustee will allocate the shares released among participants on the basis of each participant’s proportional share of qualifying compensation relative to all participants participating in the ESOP Component. A participant will become 100 % vested in his or her account balance in the ESOP Component after three years of service. In addition, p articipants will become fully vested in his or her account balance in the ESOP Component automatically upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the KSOP. Generally, participants will receive distributions from the KSOP upon separation from service in accordance with the terms of the plan document. The KSOP reallocates any unvested shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock forfeited upon termination of employment among the remaining participants in the ESOP Component. Contributions to the ESOP are to be sufficient to pay principal and interest currently due under the loan agreement. Under applicable accounting requirements, Ponce Bank will record a compensation expense for the ESOP at the average market price of the shares as they are committed to be released from the unallocated suspense account to participants’ accounts, which may be more or less than the original issue price. The compensation expense resulting from the release of the common stock from the suspense account and allocation to plan participants will result in a corresponding reduction in the earnings of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. T he ESOP shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations (see Note 11). As of March 31, 2022, the combined outstanding balance of both the First ESOP loan and Second ESOP loan was $ 15.0 million . 32 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 10. Compensation and Benefit Plans (Continued) A summary of the ESOP shares as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows: March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Shares committed-to-be released 169,756 96,500 Shares allocated to participants 235,361 170,145 Unallocated shares 1,668,101 434,251 Total 2,073,218 700,896 Fair value of unallocated shares $ 17,315 $ 6,297 The Company recognized ESOP related compensation expense, including ESOP equalization expense, of $ 373,000 and $ 157,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan: The Bank maintains a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) for the benefit of two key executive officers. The SERP expense recognized was $ 15,000 for both the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. 2018 Incentive Plan The Company’s stockholders approved the PDL Community Bancorp 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2018 Incentive Plan”) at the Special Meeting of Stockholders on October 30, 2018. The maximum number of shares of common stock which can be issued under the 2018 Incentive Plan is 1,248,469 . Of the 1,248,469 shares, the maximum number of shares that may be awarded under the 2018 Incentive Plan pursuant to the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) is 891,764 shares (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options), and the number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units is 356,705 shares. However, the 2018 Incentive Plan contains a flex feature that provides that awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units in excess of the 356,705 share limitation may be granted but each share of stock covered by such excess award shall reduce the 891,764 share limitation for awards of stock options and SARs by 3.0 shares of common stock. The Company converted 462,522 awards of stock options into 154,174 restricted stock units in 2018 and 45,000 awards of stock options into 15,000 restricted stock units in 2020. Under the 2018 Incentive Plan, the Company made grants equal to 674,645 shares on December 4, 2018 which include 119,176 incentive options to executive officers, 44,590 non-qualified options to outside directors, 322,254 restricted stock units to executive officers, 40,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers and 148,625 restricted stock units to outside directors. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company awarded 40,000 incentive options and 15,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers under the 2018 Incentive Plan. Awards to directors generally vest 20 % annually beginning with the first anniversary of the date of grant. Awards to a director with fewer than five years of service at the time of grant vest over a longer period and will not become fully vested until the director has completed ten years of service. Awards to the executive officer who is not a director vest 20 % annually beginning on December 4, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum number of stock options and SARs remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was 189,476 . As of March 31, 2022, the maximum number of stock options and SARs remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was 264,357 , after the conversion from PDL Community Bancorp common stock to Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock or restricted stock units remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was none , for both periods. If the 2018 Incentive Plan’s flex feature described above were fully utilized, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be awarded as restricted stock or restricted stock units would be 88,119 as of March 31, 2022 and 63,159 as of December 31, 2021, but would eliminate the availability of stock options and SARs available for award. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determine the fair value of restricted stock units under the Company’s 2018 Incentive Plan. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. 33 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 10. Compensation and Benefit Plans (Continued) A summary of the Company’s restricted stock unit awards activity and related information for three months ended March 31, 2022 and year ended December 31, 2021 are as follows: March 31, 2022 Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested, beginning of year 237,687 $ 12.65 Conversion and reorganization 93,933 — Granted — — Vested ( 12,440 ) 9.27 Forfeited — — Non-vested at March 31 319,180 $ 9.06 December 31, 2021 Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested, beginning of year (1) 335,919 $ 12.66 Granted — — Vested ( 98,232 ) 12.69 Forfeited — — Non-vested at December 31 237,687 $ 12.65 Compensation expense related to restricted stock units was $ 318,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 for both periods. As of March 31, 2022, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units was $ 2.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next 23 quarters . A summary of the Company’s stock option awards activity and related information for three months ended March 31, 2022 and year ended December 31, 2021 are as follows: March 31, 2022 Options Weighted- Average Exercise Price Per Share Outstanding, beginning of year (1) 203,766 $ 12.02 Conversion and reorganization 80,526 — Granted — — Exercised — — Forfeited — — Outstanding at March 31 (2) 284,292 8.62 Exercisable at March 31 (2) 136,141 $ 8.93 34 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 10.

The weighted-average exercise price for the options as of March 31, 2022 was $ 8.62 per share and the weighted average remaining contractual life is 6.6 years. The weighted average period over which compensation expenses are expected to be recognized is 3.5 years. There were 136,141 shares and 94,904 shares exercisable as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Total compensation cost related to stock options recognized was $ 33,000 for both the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options was $ 320,000 , which is expected to be recognized over the next 23 quarters . The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Dividend yield 0.00 % 0.00 % Expected life 6.5 years 6.5 years Expected volatility 38.51 % 38.51 % Risk-free interest rate 0.48 % 0.48 % Weighted average grant date fair value $ 2.70 $ 3.77 The expected volatility is based on the Company’s historical volatility. The expected life is an estimate based on management’s review of the various factors and calculated using the simplified method for plain vanilla options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s history and expectation of dividend payouts. Treasury Stock : As a result of the conversion and reorganization, all shares of treasury stock of PDL Community Bancorp were retired on January 27, 2022. 35 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 11. Earnings Per Share The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 (Dollars in thousands except share data) Net (loss) income $ ( 6,820 ) $ 2,452 Common shares outstanding for basic EPS: Weighted average common shares outstanding 22,744,101 17,078,813 Less: Weighted average unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) shares 1,022,988 530,617 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 21,721,113 16,548,196 Basic earnings per common share $ ( 0.31 ) $ 0.15 Potential dilutive common shares: Add: Dilutive effect of restricted stock awards and stock options — — Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 21,721,113 16,548,196 Diluted earnings per common share $ ( 0.31 ) $ 0.15 Note 1 2 . Commitments, Contingencies and Credit Risk Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk : In the normal course of business, financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk may be used to meet the financing needs of customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement in particular classes of financial instruments. The contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit represent the amounts of potential accounting loss should the contract be fully drawn upon, the customer default, and the value of any existing collateral become worthless. The same credit policies are used in making commitments and contractual obligations as for on-balance-sheet instruments. Financial instruments whose contractual amounts represent credit risk at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows: March 31, December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Commitments to grant mortgage loans $ 146,684 $ 127,159 Commitments to sell loans at lock-in rates 7,123 13,321 Unfunded commitments under lines of credit 80,478 80,033 $ 234,285 $ 220,513 Commitments to Grant Mortgage Loans : Commitments to grant mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as all terms and conditions are met as established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties. Material losses are not anticipated as a result of these transactions. 36 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 12. Commitments, Contingencies and Credit Risk (Continued) Commitments to Sell Loans at Lock-in Rates: In order to assure itself of a marketplace to sell its loans, Mortgage World has agreements with investors who will commit to purchase loans at locked-in rates. Mortgage World has off-balance sheet market risk to the extent that Mortgage World does not obtain matching commitments from these investors to purchase the loans. This will expose Mortgage World to the lower of cost or market valuation environment. Repurchases, Indemnifications and Premium Recaptures : Loans sold by Mortgage World under investor programs are subject to repurchase or indemnification if they fail to meet the origination criteria of those programs. In addition, loans sold to investors are also subject to repurchase or indemnifications if the loan is two or three months delinquent during a set period which usually varies from six months to a year after the loan is sold. There are no open repurchase or indemnification requests for loans sold as a correspondent lender or where the Company acted as a broker in the transaction as of March 31, 2022. Unfunded Commitments Under Lines of Credit : Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extension of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit are uncollateralized and usually contain a specified maturity date and, ultimately, may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed. Letters of Credit : Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Letters of credit are largely cash secured. Concentration by Geographic Location : Loans, commitments to extend credit and letters of credit have been granted to customers who are located primarily in the New York City metropolitan area. Generally, such loans most often are secured by one-to-four family residential. The loans are expected to be repaid from the borrowers' cash flows. Loan Concentrations : As of March 31, 2022, approximately 46.0 % of Mortgage World’s, a division of the Bank, total originated loan volume was insured and approximately 59.7 % of total originated loan volume was sold to three investors. The Bank’s Mortgage World division has closed approximately 97.9 % of its loan volume in two states, New York and New Jersey. Lease Commitments : At March 31, 2022, there are noncancelable operating leases for office space that expire on various dates through 2038 . Certain of these leases contains escalation clauses providing for increased rental based on pre-scheduled annual increases or on increases in real estate taxes. On February 11, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 3821 Bergenline Avenue, Union City, New Jersey for a sale price of $ 2.4 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $ 145,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.5 %. Under the lease agreement, the Bank has four (4) consecutive options to extend the term of the lease by five (5) years for each such option. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $ 623,000 , net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Rental expenses under operating leases, included in occupancy expense, totaled $ 1.1 million and $ 503,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The projected minimum rental payments under the terms of the leases at March 31, 2022 are as follows: (in thousands) Remainder of 2022 $ 2,662 2023 3,600 2024 3,643 2025 3,600 2026 3,422 2027 3,285 Thereafter 28,827 $ 49,039 Legal Matters : The Company is involved in various legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal course of business. Management believes that resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. 37 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 13. Fair Value The following fair value hierarchy is used based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2 – Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: Cash and Cash Equivalents, Placements with Banks, Accrued Interest Receivable, Advance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance, and Accrued Interest Payable : The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. These assets and liabilities are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Available-for-Sale Securities : These financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models (e.g., matrix pricing) or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Examples of such instruments include government agency bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Level 3 securities are securities for which significant unobservable inputs are utilized. There were no changes in valuation techniques used to measure similar assets during the period. FHLBNY Stock : The carrying value of FHLBNY stock approximates fair value since the Bank can redeem such stock with FHLBNY at cost. As a member of the FHLBNY, the Company is required to purchase this stock, which is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. Loans Receivable : For variable rate loans, which reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, carrying values are a reasonable estimate of fair values, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using estimated market rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. Impaired loans are valued using a present value discounted cash flow method, or the fair value of the collateral. Loans are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale : Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, consists of mortgage loans originated for sale by Mortgage World and accounted for under the fair value option. These assets are valued using stated investor pricing for substantially equivalent loans as Level 2. In determining fair value, such measurements are derived based on observable market data, including whole-loan transaction pricing and similar market transactions adjusted for portfolio composition, servicing value and market conditions. Loans held for sale by the Bank are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by investor bid prices. Under the fair value option, management has elected, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, fair value for substantially all forms of mortgage loans originated for sale on a recurring basis. The fair value carrying amount of mortgages held for sale measured under the fair value option was $ 8.0 million and the aggregate unpaid principal amounted to $ 7.8 million. Interest Rate Lock Commitments : The Bank, through its Mortgage World division, enters into rate lock commitments to extend credit to borrowers for generally up to a 60 day period for origination and/or purchase of loans. To the extent that a loan is ultimately granted and the borrower ultimately accepts the terms of the loan, these loan commitments expose the Bank’s Mortgage World division to variability in its fair value due to changes in interest rates. 38 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 13. Fair Value (Continued) The FASB determined that loan commitments related to the origination or acquisition of mortgage loans that will be held for sale must be accounted for as derivative instruments. Such commitments, along with any related fees received from potential borrowers, are recorded at fair value in derivative assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in income on sale of mortgage loans. Fair value is based on active market pricing for substantially similar underlying mortgage loans commonly referred to as best execution pricing or investment commitment pricing, if the loan is committed to an investor through a best efforts contract. In valuing interest rate lock commitments, there are several unobservable inputs such as the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights, estimated remaining cost to originate the loans, and the pull through rate of the open pipeline. Accordingly, such derivative is classified as Level 3. The approximate notional amounts of Mortgage World’s derivative instruments were $ 7.1 million and $ 13.3 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fair value of derivatives related to interest rate lock commitments not subject to a forward loan sale commitment, amounted to $ 152,000 and $ 172,000 as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and is included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial position. The table below presents the changes in derivatives from interest rate lock commitments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: (Dollars in thousands) Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 172 Change in fair value of derivative instrument reported in earnings ( 20 ) Balance as of March 31, 2022 152 Other Real Estate Owned : Other real estate owned represents real estate acquired through foreclosure, and is recorded at fair value less estimated disposal costs on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the asset is classified as Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the asset is classified as Level 3. Deposits : The fair values of demand deposits, savings, NOW and money market accounts equal their carrying amounts, which represent the amounts payable on demand at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-term, fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates on certificates of deposit to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on such deposits. Deposits are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. FHLBNY Advances : The fair value of the advances is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current market-based FHLBNY interest rates for advances of similar maturity to a schedule of maturities of such advances. These borrowings are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Warehouse Lines of Credit : The carrying amounts of warehouse lines of credit and mortgage loan funding payable approximate fair value and due to their short-term nature are classified as Level 2. Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments : Fair values for off-balance-sheet instruments (lending commitments and standby letters of credit) are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit standing. Off-balance-sheet instruments are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 39 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 13. Fair Value (Continued) The following tables detail the assets that are carried at fair value and measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and indicate the level within the fair value hierarchy utilized to determine the fair value: March 31, 2022 Description Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities, at fair value: U.S. Government Bonds $ 2,833 $ — $ 2,833 $ — Corporate bonds 25,101 — 25,101 — Mortgage-Backed Securities: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 46,731 — 46,731 — FNMA Certificates 79,967 — 79,967 — GNMA Certificates 167 — 167 — Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at fair value 7,972 — 7,972 — Derivatives from interest rate lock commitments 152 — — 152 $ 162,923 $ — $ 162,771 $ 152 December 31, 2021 Description Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities: U.S. Government Bonds $ 2,934 $ — $ 2,934 $ — Corporate bonds 21,184 — 21,184 — Mortgage-Backed Securities: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 18,348 — 18,348 — FNMA Certificates 70,699 — 70,699 — GNMA Certificates 181 — 181 — Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at fair value 15,836 — 15,836 — Derivatives from interest rate lock commitments 172 — — 172 $ 129,354 $ — $ 129,182 $ 172 Management’s assessment and classification of an investment within a level can change over time based upon maturity or liquidity of the investment and would be reflected at the beginning of the quarter in which the change occurred.

The fair value information about financial instruments are disclosed, whether or not recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. The estimated fair value amounts for 2022 and 2021 have been measured as of their respective period-ends and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these consolidated financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than amounts reported at each period. The information presented should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only required for a limited portion of the Company's assets and liabilities. Due to the wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company's disclosures and those of other banks may not be meaningful. Note 1 4 . Regulatory Capital Requirements The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s operations and financial statements. Under the regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total risk-based and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (as defined), common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined), and Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets (as defined) adjusted total assets (as defined). As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the applicable capital adequacy requirements specified below have been met. 42 Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 14. Regulatory Capital Requirements (Continued) The below minimum capital requirements exclude the capital conservation buffer required to avoid limitations on capital distributions including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The applicable capital buffer for the Bank was 15.27 % at March 31, 2022 and 9.23 % at December 31, 2021. The most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Company and the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, common equity risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There were no conditions or events since then that have changed the Bank's category. The Company's and the Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 as compared to regulatory requirements are as follows: To Be Well Capitalized Under For Capital Prompt Corrective Actual Adequacy Purposes Action Provisions Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (Dollars in thousands) March 31, 2022 Ponce Financial Group, Inc.

S egment Reporting The Company has two reportable segments: Ponce Bank and Mortgage World. Income from Ponce Bank consists primarily of interest earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts. Income from Mortgage World consists primarily of taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they are sold to investors. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of accounting policies. Segment profit and loss is measured by net income on an entity basis for the three months ended March 31, 2021 but on an operations basis for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated for the three months ended March 31, 2021 in consolidation. The following tables set forth condensed consolidated statements of operations and total assets for the operating segments for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Ponce Bank Mortgage World Ponce Financial Group, Inc.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. (the “Company”). The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in Part I, Item 1, of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. On January 26, 2022, the assets and liabilities of Mortgage World Bankers, Inc. (“Mortgage World”), a wholly owned subsidiary of PDL Community Bancorp, were transferred to the Bank. Except for the winding up of its operations, Mortgage World ceased to conduct business as a separate entity and is now operated as a division of the Bank. On January 27, 2022, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and PDL Community Bancorp announced that the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from the mutual to stock form of organization and related stock offering was consummated at the close of business. As a result of the closing of the conversion and reorganization and stock offering, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. is now the holding company for Ponce Bank (“Ponce Bank” or the “Bank”). Ponce Bank’s former mutual holding companies, PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, have ceased to exist.

While it appears the COVID-19 pandemic has entered into an endemic stage, related measures taken by governments, businesses and individuals as a result of the pandemic continue to cause uncertainty, volatility and disruption in the economy, including the economies of the markets that we serve. In response to the pandemic, we adjusted our business practices, including restricting employee travel, encouraging employees to work from home when possible, implementing social distancing guidelines within our offices, and continuing to hold regular meetings of our pandemic response team. Certain of these measures remain in place due to the continued prevalence of the virus, though, as of March 31, 2022, all of our customer locations are open and the majority of our employees have schedules that include work at the office. 47 Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following discussion contains certain non-GAAP financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide the reader with additional supplemental perspective on operating results, performance trends, and financial condition. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial information. The Company’s non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP information which may be presented by other companies. In all cases, it should be understood that non-GAAP operating measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders. An item that management excludes when computing non-GAAP adjusted earnings can be of substantial importance to the Company’s results and condition for any particular year. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided below. The SEC has exempted from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on GAAP. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. However, the information should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The table below includes references to the Company's net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 before gain on sale of real property and the Company’s contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation. In management's view, that information, which is considered non-GAAP information, may be useful to investors as it will improve an understanding of core operations for the current and future periods. The non-GAAP net (loss) income amount and (loss) earnings per share reflect adjustments related to the non-recurring gain on sale of real property and the Company’s contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation, net of tax effect. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP information to GAAP net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share is provided below. Non-GAAP Reconciliation – Net (Loss) Income before Gain on Sale of Real Property and Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net (loss) income - GAAP $ (6,820 ) $ 2,452 Gain on sale of real property — (663 ) Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation 4,995 — Income tax provision (benefit) (1,049 ) 139 Net (loss) income - non-GAAP $ (2,874 ) $ 1,928 (Loss) earnings per common share (GAAP) (1) $ (0.31 ) $ 0.15 (Loss) earnings per common share (non-GAAP) (1) $ (0.13 ) $ 0.12 (1) (Loss) earnings per share were computed (for the GAAP and non-GAAP basis) based on the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 (21,721,113 shares and 16,548,196 shares, respectively). COVID-19 Pandemic and the CARES Act On March 27, 2020, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) to address the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act appropriated $349.0 billion for PPP loans and on April 24, 2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) received another $310.0 billion in PPP funding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act appropriated $284.0 billion for both first and second draw PPP loans, bringing the total appropriations for PPP loans to $943.0 billion. PPP ended on May 31, 2021. Loans under the PPP that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The Company had received SBA approval and originated 5,340 PPP loans, of which 737 loans totaling $86.0 million were outstanding at March 31, 2022. PPP loans have a two-year or five-year term, provide for fees of up to 5% of the loan amount and earn interest at a rate of 1% per annum. It is our expectation that a significant portion of these remaining loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. As of March 31, 2022, the average authorized loan size was $117,000 and the median authorized loan size was $14,000. The Bank, which is designated as both a Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) 48 and a Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), originated 5 , 340 PPP loans in the amount of $ 2 61 . 4 million , which, based upon information provided by the SBA , significantly exceed ed the reported average performance of banks in our peer group . As a result of the initial COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the Company continues to alter the way it has historically provided services to its deposit customers while seeking to maintain normal day-to-day back-office operations and lending functions. To that end, as of March 31, 2022, all back-office and lending personnel have been formed into teams which alternate between a remote and in office work environment while the branch network continues to provide traditional banking services to its communities and has for the most part returned to normal operating hours while continuing to shift service delivery to electronic and web-based products. The Company continues its extensive and intensive communications program geared to informing customers of the alternative resources provided by the Company for retaining access to financial services, closing loans and conducting banking transactions, such as ATM networks, online banking, mobile applications, remote deposits and the Company’s Contact Center. The Company proactively manages its day-to-day operations by using video and telephonic conferencing. The Company remains vigilant of the potential for other COVID-19 variant outbreaks and remains prepared to restore the necessary protocols to minimize any disruptions to its current operations and services. Federal Economic Relief Funds To Aid Lending On August 10, 2021, the Company through its subsidiary, the Bank, received from the United States Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) a grant in the amount of $1.8 million in federal Economic Relief Funds for Small Businesses under the Treasury’s Rapid Response Program for CDFIs. The Treasury also has determined that the Company is eligible to receive up to $225.0 million in capital under the Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”) for CDFI and MDI institutions, which funding amount Treasury has determined will be $185.6 million, subject to increase as further funds become available. The Company has indicated to Treasury its willingness to accept such additional funds. Closing of the ECIP funding has been tentatively scheduled by Treasury to be on June 7, 2022. Critical Accounting Policies Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management and that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets, liabilities or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is established as probable incurred losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. See Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the accompanying Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. Factors Affecting the Comparability of Results Sale of Real Property. O n February 11, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 3821 Bergenline Avenue, Union City, New Jersey for a sale price of $2.4 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $145,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.5%. Under the lease agreement, the Bank has four (4) consecutive options to extend the term of the lease by five (5) years for each such option. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $623,000, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations . 49 Ponce De Leon Foundation. On January 27, 2022, the Company made a $5.0 million contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation as part of the conversion and reorganization, which is included in non-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Write-off and Write-Down. In 2020, the Company entered into a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain Technologies, Inc. (“Grain”). Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to $1,000 and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originates and services these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan is found to be fraudulent, becomes 120 days delinquent upon 120 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.” The Bank, pursuant to its agreement with Grain, at December 31, 2021, had 59,180 microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with credit extensions aggregating $33.9 million. Of these microloans, the Bank estimates that 80 percent have been made in low- and low-to-moderate income census tracts with an estimated 56 percent made to minority borrowers. At March 31, 2022, the Bank had 54,247 microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $31.0 million and which were performing, in management’s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios. Under the agreement with the Bank, Grain earns origination and servicing fees based on the Bank’s earnings from the microloans. Since entering into the agreement with Grain in 2020 through March 31, 2022, the Bank has paid Grain $1.9 million in such fees. The Company also has directly invested $1.0 million in Grain. Grain has been victimized by cyber fraud using synthetic and other forms of fraudulent identifications, a phenomenon that has become prevalent with FinTechs. Since the beginning of its agreement with Grain through March 31, 2022, 24,719 microloans amounting to $17.0 million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain, of which, as of March 31, 2022, $11.8 million remain outstanding in the Grain Receivable (inclusive of a $1.8 million reserve established as of December 31, 2021 by the Bank using a $1.8 million grant received from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Rapid Response Program to reduce the Grain Receivable at December 31, 2021 to $8.5 million, an amount management considered collectible at the time under the facts and circumstances then known). Grain has agreed to apply at least 85% of origination and servicing fees received from the Bank as payment for the Grain Receivable, and, upon the completion of a series A financing, pay all amounts due on the Grain Receivable. Although Grain has successfully held pre-series A fundraising rounds, including through April 30, 2022, Grain remains a pre-profit startup highly dependent on earnings from its relationship with the Bank, a new relationship with another financial institution, and further capital raises which may not materialize. Accordingly, Grain’s ability to pay the Grain Receivable in the short term, taking into account current economic conditions and regulatory requirements, was considered. Based on further investigation, evaluation and financial analysis during the first quarter of 2022, the Company has assessed the collectability of the $11.8 million remaining Grain Receivable and has determined that it is appropriate to write-off approximately $6.3 million and provide for an additional reserve of $1.7 million, after applying a $1.6 million security deposit set-off, leaving a net Grain Receivable balance of $2.2 million at March 31, 2022. This write-off and write-down has negatively affected the Company’s pre-tax earnings by approximately $8.1 million and its net income by approximately $5.7 million, or approximately ($0.26) and ($0.26) per basic and diluted share, respectively, on an after-tax basis. In arriving at the amounts to be written-off and written-down, the Company considered, among other things, the Bank’s right to offset security deposits associated with fraudulent loans, payments received from Grain subsequent to December 31, 2021, and the discounted net present value of future cash flows reasonably expected to be received by the Bank from Grain over the next 18 months, based on prior payments, and the Bank’s estimate for any additional incurred fraudulent identities in the Grain portfolio. The Bank determined that a 12% discount rate was appropriate in calculating net present value of such payments. In addition, the Bank has considered the likelihood of Grain prevailing in litigation it has instituted against a third party vendor where Grain is demanding damages resulting from fraudulent loans originated by Grain that were subject to the synthetic identifications that Grain’s vendor failed to identify. Grain is presently conducting a capital raise in the form of a private placement of securities which has not been incorporated into the analysis. Grain is also currently in the process of reviewing and affirming the compliance of the remaining loans in the portfolio, which may have additional fraudulent losses that are currently not estimable. 50 The Company continues to closely monitor its portfolio of consumer loans originated by Grain as well as Grain’s refinement of solutions for detecting and preventing cyber fraud in the application for microloans. The Company has requested, and Grain has agreed, that no new microloans be originated until further notice and that further extensions of credit to an existing microloan borrower only be made upon confirmation that such borrower is not fraudulent. The Company also evaluates on a monthly basis the likelihood that Grain will be able to make payments on the Grain Receivable. If, as a result of its continuing evaluation, the Company determines that Grain will not be able to make timely payments on the Grain Receivable or additional Grain originated microloans are found to be fraudulent, the Bank may be required to write-off some or all of the remaining value of the Grain Receivable, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. Further, like other start-up companies, there is a higher level of risk that Grain may not be able to execute its business plan and may fail. In the event Grain were to cease operations, and although it has considered contingency plans, the Bank may have greater difficulty in servicing and collecting the microloan portfolio. In such a case, the level the Bank has provided for in its allowance for loan losses for its microloan portfolio may be inadequate and it may need to increase its provision for loan losses, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. As a consequence of such events the Bank may determine it appropriate to terminate its relationship with Grain and the value of the Company’s equity investment in Grain could become impaired . The $8.1 million write-off and write-down is included in non-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Vision 2025 Evolves The Company is now in the later stages of its multi-pronged effort to upgrade its infrastructure, adopt electronic banking services and restructure its retail business model. Dubbed internally “Vision 2020,” the effort has resulted in significant beneficial results, continues to involve significant investments and has served to ameliorate the otherwise detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of Vision 2020, the Company partnered with Salesforce to deploy applications throughout the organization, including retail services, lending processes, back-office operations, digital banking and loan underwriting. Although the full implementation of the applications, dubbed internally as “GPS, a Guided Path to Success,” was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was fully implemented by the end 2021. The infrastructure upgrade has focused primarily on implementing technology, cybersecurity and network progression while establishing a Virtual Private Network (“VPN”). To date the infrastructure upgrade has resulted in relocating and migrating network and in-house servers, replacing outdated PCs, enhancing internet capabilities, purchasing and deploying VPN-enabled laptops to a significant majority of the Bank’s personnel and the redeployment of disaster recovery capabilities. The Company has achieved certain manpower-related cost savings and enabled the uninterrupted continuity of operations by its staff working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic using its newly deployed disaster recovery capabilities. The infrastructure upgrade has added resiliency, capacity and redundancies to the Company’s technology structures and enhances the capability of the Company to increase its flexibility with alternate locations of personnel. The Company has adopted and deployed over 48 new electronic banking services, products and applications since late 2018. These services range from on-line banking, mobile banking, bill pay, positive pay, remote deposit capture, cash management services, e-statements, data storage and management, ACH services, electronic document storage, a paperless environment, dual-language telephone banking service and VoIP telecommunications with an automation-based, dual-language Customer Contact Center. These services have not only enabled the Company to continue serving its customers as they, and the Company, converted to a remote work environment; the services have served to increase the product penetration and deepening relationships with customers. The Company has also added to its social media capabilities and has begun to use them in coordination with new targeted marketing campaigns now enabled by GPS and its Marketing Cloud platform. The combination of social media and targeted marketing campaigns was particularly effective with PPP loan originations using many partnerships established with non-profit groups and community-based organizations. Such efforts enabled the Company to more than triple the number of second round PPP loan applications compared to the first round, and has resulted in significant growth in retail deposits and new relationships. The Company is also in the final stages of deploying a Fintech-based small business automated lending technology in partnership with LendingFront Technologies, Inc. The technology is a mobile application that digitizes the lending workflow from pre-approval to servicing and enables the Company to originate, close and fund small business loans within very short spans of time, without requiring a physical presence within banking offices and with automated underwriting using both traditional and non-traditional methods. The application has full loan origination and servicing capabilities and is integrated with Salesforce. All Commercial Relationship Officers and Business Development Managers will utilize these capabilities upon the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic and completion of a pilot test. The Company is seeking to establish loan origination partnerships with non-profit and community-based organizations to ensure penetration in underserved and underbanked markets. The Company also established a relationship with SaveBetter, LLC, a fintech startup focusing on brokered deposits. As of March 31, 2022, the Company had $42.8 million in such deposits. The recent regulatory easing of brokered deposit rules may enable the Company to classify such deposits as core deposits. 51 The Company’s on-going adoption of a new retail business model has been all-encompassing. It has involved the redesign of its retail branches, the shift of branch operations to a centralized back office, the deployment of smart ITM-enabled ATMs and Teller Cash Recyclers, the automation of manual processes and, importantly, the adoption of universal bankers and retail sales. In 2019, the Company earned national recognition as Branch Innovators of the Year for its retail banking model at the 2019 Future Branches Retail Banking Summit in Austin, Texas. The Company has renovated most of its branches at costs significantly less than previous efforts largely as a result of economies of scale, design modifications and adoption of buildout techniques used by non-bank retail organizations. The Bank’s Riverdale branch was transformed into a new flagship recapturing previously subleased space. This $1.5 million construction project commenced on March 1, 2021 and was completed on time and on budget. Our grand re-opening took place on July 27, 2021 and was attended by the Bronx Borough President who praised Ponce Bank for remaining committed to the Bronx and for a long history of leadership within the community. Our Astoria branch renovation project was also completed in the second quarter of 2021. The Company intends to renovate up to 7 additional branches in 2022. Renovation is now proceeding at our Smith Street, Brooklyn, Union City, NJ, and Southern Boulevard, Bronx, banking branches with the design phase completed at Southern Boulevard and in process at Smith Street and Union City. Surveys are complete at Forest Hills, Jackson Heights, and Stuyvesant Town branches. The Company has begun incorporating into its retail branches loan origination personnel including a branded Ponce Mortgage Center celebrating our comprehensive offerings made possible by our subsidiary Ponce De Leon Mortgage Corporation as well as the Bank’s new division, Mortgage World Bankers. The Company still anticipates creating a full-service branch at its mortgage office located in Flushing, Queens, New York and a banking satellite at its office in Bergenfield, New Jersey, but these projects are temporarily on hold pending completion of other renovations. The Company’s mortgage office in Flushing, Queens, expanded the Company’s reach into one of the most underserved areas of Queens according to recently reported PPP loan penetration data. Vision 2020 already has had a transformational effect on the Company. The Company had approximately $1.06 billion in assets, $918.5 million in loans and $809.8 million in deposits, at December 31, 2018. The Company has since grown to $1.59 billion in assets, $1.30 billion in loans receivables, net of allowance for loan losses of $16.9 million, and $1.18 billion in deposits at March 31, 2022, all while investing in infrastructure, implementing digital banking, acquiring Mortgage World, adopting GPS, diversifying its product offering, meeting the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, partnering with Fintech companies and assisting its communities with 5,340 PPP loans totaling $261.4 million. The Company raised over $132.0 million in additional capital through our conversion and reorganization and realized approximately $20.0 million in net gain while freeing up approximately $40.0 million in investable funds through our sale-and-leaseback initiative. Now, the Company believes that it is poised to enhance its presence, locally and in similar communities outside New York, as a leading CDFI and MDI financial institution holding company. On December 14, 2021, Treasury notified the Company that it is eligible to receive an amount up to $185.6 million (which may increased to $225.0 million) under the ECIP. Under the ECIP, Treasury will provide investment capital directly to depository institutions that are CDFIs or MDIs, such as the Bank or their holding companies such as the Company, to provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers, in low-income and underserved communities. If made, Treasury’s investment would be in exchange for the Company issuing senior perpetual noncumulative preferred stock directly to Treasury on terms established by the Treasury. Treasury has indicated that the investment will qualify as Tier 1 capital . No dividends will accrue or be due for the first two years after issuance. For years three through ten, depending upon the level of qualified and/or deep impact lending made in targeted communities, as defined in the ECIP guidelines, dividends will be at an annual rate of either 2.0%, 1.25% or 0.5% and, thereafter, will be fixed at one of the foregoing rates. The preferred stock will provide for customary preferences, including provisions upon nonpayment of dividends and board seats in such an event as well as customary protective provisions. Treasury has notified the Company that it anticipates closing the ECIP transaction on June 7, 2022. The Company is evaluating the proposed standard terms of the investment provided by the Treasury, as well as other considerations. We cannot provide any assurance or guarantee concerning what the actual terms, conditions and preferences of the senior preferred stock will be or whether they will be acceptable. The Company is cementing Vision 2025, its roadmap to acquiring the resources needed to lead efforts to remediate the disparate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the wealth and financial gaps present in its communities and similar communities outside the New York City metropolitan area. The Company traces its roots to its organization in 1960 as Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association by Latino leaders concerned that the financial needs of the Bronx and its Latino population were not being recognized and addressed. True to its roots, the Company remains committed to ensuring that the disparate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the wealth and financial gaps present in minority communities are addressed in earnest 52 The following table presents the Company’s PPP loans outstanding as of March 31, 2022: Aggregate Median Average Number Amount Amount Amount State Counties of Loans of Loans of Loans of Loans (Dollars in thousands) New York Albany 2 $ 116 $ 58 $ 58 Bronx 165 14,382 13 87 Dutchess 2 31 15 16 Kings 92 31,918 15 347 Nassau 43 2,591 11 60 New York 107 26,557 16 248 Orange 3 36 11 12 Queens 208 6,483 15 31 Richmond 6 278 17 46 Rockland 4 169 22 42 Suffolk 15 192 11 13 Westchester 24 451 11 19 Total New York 671 $ 83,204 $ 14 $ 124 New Jersey Bergen 16 $ 678 $ 20 $ 42 Burlington 1 20 20 20 Camden 1 21 21 21 Essex 16 163 12 10 Hudson 15 1,167 19 78 Mercer 2 52 26 26 Monmouth 2 533 267 267 Ocean 3 24 6 8 Passaic 6 58 10 10 Sussex 1 12 12 12 Union 2 16 8 8 Total New Jersey 65 $ 2,744 $ 15 $ 42 Pennsylvania Berks 1 16 16 16 Total 737 $ 85,964 $ 14 $ 117 Comparison of Financial Condition at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 Total Assets . Total consolidated assets decreased $58.9 million, or 3.6%, to $1.59 billion at March 31, 2022 from $1.65 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease in total assets is attributable to decreases of $84.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, $7.9 million in mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, $6.4 million in other assets, $4.6 million in net loans receivable (inclusive of $50.8 million net decrease in PPP loans), $581,000 in FHLBNY stock and $338,000, net, in premises and equipment. The decrease in total assets was reduced by increases of $41.5 million in available-for-sale securities, $3.6 million in deferred tax assets and $437,000 in accrued interest receivable. Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents decreased $84.6 million, or 55.0%, to $69.3 million at March 31, 2022, compared to $153.9 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of purchases of available-for-sale securities, a decrease in net deposits, a decrease in advances of warehouse lines of credit, repayment of advances from the FHLBNY and a contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was offset by proceeds from the sale of loans, proceeds from maturities/calls of available-for-sale securities, increase in advance payments by borrowers and proceeds from redemption of FHLBNY stock. 53 Securities. The composition of securities at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and the amounts maturing of each classification are summarized as follows: March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Amortized Fair Amortized Fair Cost Value Cost Value (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities: U.S. Government Bonds: Amounts maturing: Three months or less $ — $ — $ — $ — More than three months through one year — — — — More one year through five years 2,982 2,833 2,981 2,934 More than five years through ten years — — — — 2,982 2,833 2,981 2,934 Corporate Bonds: Amounts maturing: Three months or less — — — — More than three months through one year — — — — More one year through five years 4,000 3,801 4,445 4,381 More than five years through ten years 21,849 21,300 16,798 16,803 25,849 25,101 21,243 21,184 Mortgage-Backed Securities 134,854 126,865 90,950 89,228 Total Available-for-Sale Securities $ 163,685 $ 154,799 $ 115,174 $ 113,346 Held-to-Maturity Securities: Mortgage-Backed Securities 927 868 934 914 Total Held-to-Maturity Securities $ 927 $ 868 $ 934 $ 914 The $41.5 million increase in available-for-sale securities was due to $53.4 million in available-for-sale securities that were purchased during the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase was offset primarily by a $8.8 million in unrealized loss, $4.5 million in principal payments and one available-for-sale security in the amount of $445,000 was called during the three months ended March 31, 2022. There were no available-for-sale securities sold during the three months ended March 31, 2022. Gross Loans Receivable. The composition of gross loans receivable at March 31, 2022 and at December 31, 2021 and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows: March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Increase (Decrease) Amount Percent Amount Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential Investor-Owned $ 323,442 24.6 % $ 317,304 24.0 % $ 6,138 1.9 % Owner-Occupied 95,234 7.2 % 96,947 7.3 % (1,713 ) (1.8 %) Multifamily residential 368,133 28.0 % 348,300 26.3 % 19,833 5.7 % Nonresidential properties 251,893 19.1 % 239,691 18.1 % 12,202 5.1 % Construction and land 144,881 11.0 % 134,651 10.2 % 10,230 7.6 % Total mortgage loans 1,183,583 90.0 % 1,136,893 86.0 % 46,690 4.1 % Nonmortgage loans: Business loans (1) 100,253 7.6 % 150,512 11.4 % (50,259 ) (33.4 %) Consumer loans (2) 31,899 2.4 % 34,693 2.6 % (2,794 ) (8.1 %) Total nonmortgage loans 132,152 10.0 % 185,205 14.0 % (53,053 ) (28.6 %) Total gross loans $ 1,315,735 100.0 % $ 1,322,098 100.0 % $ (6,363 ) (0.5 %) (1) As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, business loans include $86.0 million and $136.8 million, respectively, of PPP loans. (2) As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, consumer loans include $31.0 million and $33.9 million of microloans originated by the Bank pursuant to its arrangement with Grain. 54 The decrease in the loan portfolio was primarily the result of a $50.8 million decrease in PPP loans at March 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. Based on current internal loan reviews, the Company believes that the quality of our underwriting, our weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 57.3% and our customer selection processes have served us well and provided us with a reliable base with which to maintain a well-protected loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans, as defined by applicable banking regulations, include multifamily residential, nonresidential properties, and construction and land mortgage loans. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximately 8.6% and 7.9%, respectively, of the outstanding principal balance of the Bank’s commercial real estate mortgage loans were secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses predominantly on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on valuation of the real estate. Banking regulations have established guidelines relating to the amount of construction and land mortgage loans and investor- owned commercial real estate mortgage loans of 100% and 300% of total risk-based capital, respectively. Should a bank’s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. The Bank’s policy is to operate within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and up to 400% for investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank’s total risk-based capital. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bank’s construction and land mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 54.3% and 79.6%, respectively. Investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 263.6% and 396.2% as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. At March 31, 2022, the Bank was within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and the 300% guideline for investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans established by banking regulators. Management believes that it has established the appropriate level of controls to monitor the Bank’s lending in these areas. Mortgage Loans Held For Sale . Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, at March 31, 2022 decreased $7.8 million to $8.0 million from $15.8 million at December 31, 2021. Deposits. The composition of deposits at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and changes in dollars and percentages are summarized as follows: March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Increase (Decrease) Percent Percent Amount of Total Amount of Total Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Demand (1) $ 281,132 23.8 % $ 274,956 22.8 % $ 6,176 2.2 % Interest-bearing deposits: NOW/IOLA accounts 33,010 2.8 % 35,280 2.9 % (2,270 ) (6.4 %) Money market accounts 169,847 14.4 % 186,893 15.5 % (17,046 ) (9.1 %) Reciprocal deposits 160,510 13.6 % 143,221 11.9 % 17,289 12.1 % Savings accounts 133,966 11.4 % 134,887 11.2 % (921 ) (0.7 %) Total NOW, money market, reciprocal and savings 497,333 42.1 % 500,281 41.5 % (2,948 ) (0.6 %) Certificates of deposit of $250K or more 75,130 6.4 % 78,454 6.5 % (3,324 ) (4.2 %) Brokered certificates of deposit 79,282 6.7 % 79,320 6.6 % (38 ) (0.0 %) Listing service deposits (2) 53,876 4.6 % 66,411 5.5 % (12,535 ) (18.9 %) Certificates of deposit less than $250K 194,412 16.5 % 205,294 17.0 % (10,882 ) (5.3 %) Total certificates of deposit 402,700 34.1 % 429,479 35.6 % (26,779 ) (6.2 %) Total interest-bearing deposits 900,033 76.2 % 929,760 77.1 % (29,727 ) (3.2 %) Total deposits $ 1,181,165 100.0 % $ 1,204,716 100.0 % $ (23,551 ) (2.0 %) (1) As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included in demand deposits are deposits related to net PPP funding. (2) As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were $19.0 million and $29.0 million, respectively, in individual listing service deposits amounting to $250,000 or more. All brokered certificates of deposit individually amounted to less than $250,000. When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the Company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk and interest rate risk in line with management objectives. The Company’s Interest Rate Risk Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding and noncore funding reliance. The overall reliance on wholesale funding and noncore funding were within those policy limitations as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Management Asset/Liability Committee generally meets on a bi-weekly basis to review funding needs, if any, and to ensure the Company operates within the approved limitations. 55 Advances from FHLBNY . The Bank had outstanding borrowings at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 of $93.4 million and $106.3 million, respectively. These borrowings are in the form of advances from the FHLBNY. Warehouse Lines of Credit . Mortgage World had maintained two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the origination and sale of residential mortgages. At December 31, 2021, Mortgage World utilized $15.1 million for funding of mortgage loans held for sale and had unused lines of credit of $14.9 million. At March 31, 2022, the remaining balance of such lines of credit was $753,000. During the first quarter of 2022, Mortgage World became a division of the Bank and the Bank began funding these loans. Stockholders’ Equity . The Company’s consolidated stockholders’ equity increased $110.3 million, or 58.3%, to $299.6 million at March 31, 2022 from $189.3 million at December 31, 2021. This increase in stockholders’ equity was mainly attributable to $118.0 million as a result of the sale of equity in the second-step conversion and reorganization, $4.0 million contribution in common stock to the Ponce De Leon Foundation, $366,000 in Employee Stock Ownership Plan shares committed to be released and $351,000 in share-based compensation, offset by $6.8 million in net loss and $5.6 million in other comprehensive loss. Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 The discussion of the Company’s results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 are presented below. The results of operations for interim periods may not be indicative of future results. Ponce Financial Group, Inc., as the successor by merger with PDL Community Bancorp Consolidated Overview. Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was ($6.8 million) compared to net income of $2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Loss per basic and diluted share was ($0.31) for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.15 for three months ended March 31, 2021. The net loss from net income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 was due to an increase of $15.2 million in non-interest expense (of which $8.1 million was attributable to the write-off and write-down related to the Grain Receivable and $5.0 million was the contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation), a decrease of $1.7 million in non-interest income and an increase of $572,000 in provision for loan losses. The net loss was offset by increases of $4.4 million in net interest income and a $2.9 million benefit for income taxes, rather than a $732,000 provision for income taxes quarter to quarter. Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $3.8 million, or 25.3%, to $19.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from $ 15.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Interest income on loans receivable, which is the Company’s primary source of income, increased $3.3 million, or 21.9%, to $18.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from $ 14.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in average loans receivable due mostly to PPP lending. Average loans receivable increased $86.3 million, or 7.0% to $1.33 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to $1.24 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 . Interest and dividend income on available-for-sale securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks increased $566,000, or 224.6%, to $818,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from $ 252,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $605,000, or 26.5%, to $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to a lower average cost of funds. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $4.4 million, or 34.5%, to $17.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from $12.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to three months ended March 31, 2021 was attributable to an increase of $3.8 million in interest and dividend income primarily due to an increase in average loans receivable and a decrease of $605,000 in interest expense due primarily to a lower average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest rate spread increased by 72 basis points to 4.48% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from 3.76% for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in the net interest rate spread for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the average yields on interest-earning assets of 44 basis points to 5.14% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from 4.70% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, and a decrease in the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 28 basis points to 0.66% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from 0.94% for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Net interest margin increased 68 basis points for the three months ended March 31, 2022, to 4.68% from 4.00% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, reflecting both our organic loan growth and the amortization of fee income from our PPP lending. 56 The historically low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response the turmoil resulting from COVID-19 pandemic is ending. The Federal Reserve Board increased the benchmark federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points on March 16, 2022 and an add i tional increase on May 5, 2022 of 50 basis points . The Federal Reserve Board has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases during 2022; may be as many as five more. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. The Bank believes it is well positioned to withstand this rising interest rate environment in the near term as it is asset sensitive . Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income decreased $1.7 million, or 42.8%, to $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from $3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The decrease in non-interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 was due to decreases of $1.1 million in income on sale of mortgage loans, $663,000, net of expenses, from the sale of real properties recognized in the first quarter of 2021, $186,000 in late and prepayment charges and $78,000 in loan origination fees, offset by increases of $124,000 in other non-interest income, $115,000 in brokerage commissions and $111,000 in service charges and fees. Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $15.2 million, or 117.4%, to $28.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from $12.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in non-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 was attributable to an aggregate $8.1 million in write-off and write-down related to the receivable due from Grain for microloans originated by Grain and put back to Grain due to fraud, $5.0 million in contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation in connection with the second-step conversion and reorganization, and increases of $1.5 million in compensation and benefits, $558,000 in occupancy and equipment, $253,000 in data processing expenses, $72,000 in professional fees and $33,000 in marketing and promotional expense, offset by decreases of $174,000 in other operating expenses and $135,000 in direct loan expenses. Income Tax (Benefit) Provision. The Company had a benefit for income taxes of ($2.9 million) for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to a provision for income taxes of $732,000 for three months ended March 31, 2021 , resulting in effective tax rates of 30.2% and 23.0%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is attributable to an increase of $168,000 in the valuation allowance related to the unused non-deductible portion of the remaining charitable contribution deduction. Segments. The Company has two reportable segments; the Bank and, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, Mortgage World, and, for the three months ended March 31, 2022, Mortgage World as a division of the Bank. Income from the Bank consists primarily of interest and fees earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts. Income from Mortgage World consists primarily of taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they are sold to investors. The table below shows the results of operations for the Company’s segments, the Bank and Mortgage World, for the periods indicated.

The Bank’s, excluding Mortgage World, total assets decreased $55.8 million, or 3.4%, to $1.57 billion at March 31, 2021 from $1.63 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease in the Bank’s total assets was primarily due to decreases of $90.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, $4.6 million in net loans receivable, $4.5 million in other assets, $581,000 in FHLBNY stock and $320,000 in premises and equipment. The decrease in total assets was offset by increases of $41.5 million in available-for-sale securities, $2.5 million in deferred tax assets and $344,000 in accrued interest receivable. Net Income (Loss). The Bank’s net loss was ($3.5 million) for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to net income of $2.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in non-interest expense as a resulf of an aggregate $8.1 million write-off and write down related to the Grain Receivable. Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $3.9 million, or 25.7%, to $18.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from $15.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 . Interest income on loans receivable, which is the Bank’s primary source of income, increased $3.3 million, or 22.3% to $18.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from $14.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. 59 The following table presents interest income on loans receivable for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) 1-4 Family residential $ 5,051 $ 5,136 $ (85 ) (1.7 %) Multifamily residential 3,839 3,507 332 9.5 % Nonresidential properties 3,084 2,412 672 27.9 % Construction and land 2,099 1,891 208 11.0 % Business loans 2,470 906 1,564 172.6 % Consumer loans 1,527 923 604 65.4 % Total interest income on loans receivable $ 18,070 $ 14,775 $ 3,295 22.3 % * Represents more than 500%.

Net interest income increased $4.4 million, or 33.9%, to $17.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from $12.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily as a result of organic loan growth and a lower average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish the ALLL that, in management’s opinion, should be adequate to provide coverage for the inherent losses on outstanding loans. In evaluating the level of the ALLL, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit 60 losses. See Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —Allowance for Loan Losses” of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. After an evaluation of these factors, the Bank established a provision for loan losses for the three months ended March 31, 2022 of $1.3 million compared to $686,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021 . The provision for loan losses during the three months ended March 31, 2022 was impacted by the change in qualitative factors during the period related to the microloans originated by Grain. The provision for loan losses during the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily reflects the Bank’s assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on borrowers and their ability to repay in the short-term. Non-interest Income . Non-interest inc ome decreased $749,000, or 41.5%, to $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 . The following table presents non-interest income for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Service charges and fees $ 440 $ 329 $ 111 33.7 % Brokerage commissions 133 — 133 — % Late and prepayment charges 58 244 (186 ) (76.2 %) Gain on sale of real property — 663 (663 ) (100.0 %) Other 424 568 (144 ) (25.4 %) Total non-interest income $ 1,055 $ 1,804 $ (749 ) (41.5 %) Non-interest Expense . Non-interest expense increased $10.1 million, or 101.2%, to $20.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from $10.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 . The increase was primarily due to an aggregate $8.1 million write-off and write-down related to the Grain Receivable due from Grain for microloans originated by Grain and put back to Grain due to fraud, and an increase of $1.0 million in compensation and benefits. The following table presents non-interest expense for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Compensation and benefits $ 5,095 $ 4,072 $ 1,023 25.1 % Occupancy and equipment 3,033 2,498 535 21.4 % Data processing expenses 836 581 255 43.9 % Direct loan expenses 768 462 306 66.2 % Insurance and surety bond premiums 147 146 1 0.7 % Office supplies, telephone and postage 358 352 6 1.7 % Professional fees 925 777 148 19.0 % Grain write-off and write-down 8,074 — 8,074 — % Marketing and promotional expenses 61 29 32 110.3 % Directors fees 71 69 2 2.9 % Regulatory dues 83 60 23 38.3 % Other operating expenses 667 954 (287 ) (30.1 %) Total non-interest expense $ 20,118 $ 10,000 $ 10,118 101.2 % Mortgage World Segment Total Assets. Mortgage World’s total assets decreased $4.2 million, or 20.7%, to $15.9 million at March 31, 2022 from $20.1 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in Mortgage World’s total assets was primarily due to decreases of $7.9 million in mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, $503,000 in other assets, $41,000 in loans receivable and $18,000 in premises and equipment. The 61 decrease in Mortgage World’s total assets was offset by increases of $4.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $93,000 in accrued interest receivable. Net Income (Loss). Mortgage World’s net loss was ($864,000) for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to net income of $37,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Non-interest Income . Non-interest income decreased $1.1 million, or 45.0%, to $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 . The decrease in non-interest income was attributable to a decrease of $1.1 million in gain on sale of mortgage loans. The following table presents non-interest income for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Brokerage commissions $ 205 $ 223 $ (18 ) (8.1 %) Gain on sale of mortgage loans 418 1,508 (1,090 ) (72.3 %) Loan origination 461 539 (78 ) (14.5 %) Other 213 88 125 142.0 % Total non-interest income $ 1,297 $ 2,358 $ (1,061 ) (45.0 %) Non-interest Expense .

The most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of the Bank’s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of its financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. The Bank’s Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in the Bank’s assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given the business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with policies and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank currently utilizes a third-party modeling solution that is prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate its sensitivity to changing interest rates, given the Bank’s business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors . The Bank does not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities. Mortgage World did not engage in hedging activities to cover the risks of interest rate movements while it held mortgages for sale. The then low mortgage interest rates and their limited volatility had effectively mitigated such risks. 62 Net Interest Income Simulation Models . Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software that measures the Bank ’s earnings through simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, the Bank has policy guidelines for earnings risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. As of March 3 1 , 202 2 , in the event of an instantaneous upward and downward change in rates from management's interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated: Net Interest Income Year 1 Change Rate Shift (1) Year 1 Forecast from Level (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 68,379 (5.15%) +300 69,421 (3.71%) +200 70,410 (2.33%) +100 71,339 (1.05%) Level 72,093 —% -100 71,961 (0.18%) (1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The behavior of the deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in the projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the benefit in those scenarios. At March 31, 2022, the earnings simulation model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Economic Value of Equity Model . While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to net interest income, the Economic Value of Equity Model (“EVE”) measures estimated changes to the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. Rates are then shocked as prescribed by the Interest Rate Risk Policy to measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Interest Rate Risk Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At March 31, 2022, the EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: EVE as a Percentage of Present Value of Assets (3) Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Increase Change in Interest Estimated EVE EVE (Decrease) Rates (basis points) (1) EVE (2) Amount Percent Ratio (4) (basis points) (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 223,690 $ (77,286 ) (25.68 %) 15.32 % (2,568 ) +300 241,665 (59,311 ) (19.71 %) 16.19 % (1,971 ) +200 260,186 (40,790 ) (13.55 %) 17.03 % (1,355 ) +100 280,786 (20,190 ) (6.71 %) 17.95 % (671 ) Level 300,976 — — % 18.79 % — -100 326,945 25,969 8.63 % 19.92 % 863 (1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. (2) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. (3) Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets. (4) EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets. 63 Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. At March 31, 2022, the EVE model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors’ approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Most Likely Earnings Simulation Models . Management also analyzes a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress the balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management and weighted to determine the most likely result. These processes assist management to better anticipate financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to review other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. The Asset/Liability Committee reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing and capital policies. Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in the Bank’s regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behaviors that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from the Bank’s historical studies of financial instruments and the best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into Bank’s asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare its results to other banks. The Asset/Liability Management Committee may determine that the Company should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and its conclusions regarding interest rate fluctuations in future periods. The historically low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response the turmoil resulting from COVID-19 pandemic is ending. The Federal Reserve Board increased the benchmark federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points on March 16, 2022 and an additional increase on May 5, 2022 of 50 basis points. The Federal Reserve Board has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases during 2022; maybe as many as five more. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. The Bank believes it is well positioned to withstand this rising interest rate environment in the near term as it is asset sensitive. GAP Analysis . In addition, management analyzes interest rate sensitivity by monitoring the Bank’s interest rate sensitivity ""gap."" The interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing-liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive 64 liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period, and a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period. The following table sets forth the Company’s interest-earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities at March 31, 2022, which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown based upon certain assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at March 31, 2022, on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments. The loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable-rate loans.

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and EVE tables presented assume that the composition of the interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income and EVE tables provide an indication of the interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and EVE and will differ from actual results. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table. Interest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of loans, deposits and borrowings. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity describes the ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Company’s customers and to fund current and future planned expenditures. The primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and available-for-sale securities and proceeds from the sale of loans. The Bank also has access to borrow from the FHLBNY. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bank had $93.4 million and $106.3 million, respectively, of term and overnight outstanding advances from the FHLBNY, and also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through letters of credit of up to $21.5 million, both as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there was eligible collateral of approximately $377.2 million and $362.3 million, respectively, in mortgage loans available to secure advances from the FHLBNY. The Bank also has an unsecured line of credit of $25.0 million with a correspondent bank, of which there was none outstanding at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Bank did not have any outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements with brokers as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, Mortgage World maintained two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans, with maximum credit lines of $30.0 million , of which $15.1 million was utilized, 66 with $14.9 million remaining unused . As of March 31, 2022, Mortgage World was a division of the Bank and the Bank was funding these loans . Although maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The most liquid assets are cash and interest-bearing deposits in banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $12.0 million and $22.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations, purchases of new securities, and purchase of equipment offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed securities, and proceeds from the sale of real estate was $(44.8 million) and $(86.1 million) for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities, consisting of activities in deposit accounts, advances, and repurchase and sale of shares as treasury stock, was ($51.8 million) and $81.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on the Company’s current assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and current global and regional market conditions on its borrowers, management has determined that these may be a detriment to borrowers’ ability to repay in the short-term and that the likelihood of long-term detrimental effects will depend significantly on the resolution of these factors and the resumption of normalized economic activities, a factor not yet determinable. The Bank’s management also took steps to enhance the Company’s liquidity position by increasing its on balance sheet cash and cash equivalents position in order to meet unforeseen liquidity events and to fund upcoming funding needs . At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, all regulatory capital requirements were met, resulting in the Company and the Bank being categorized as well capitalized at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change this categorization. Material Cash Requirements Commitments . As a financial services provider, the Company routinely is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. Although these contractual obligations represent the Company’s future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans originated. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans and extend credit of $234.3 million and $220.5 million, respectively. It is anticipated that the Company will have sufficient funds available to meet its current lending commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from March 31, 2022 totaled $242.1 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing time deposits will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits are not retained, the Company may utilize FHLBNY advances, unsecured credit lines with correspondent banks, or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. Contractual Obligations . In the ordinary course of its operations, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. There have been no material changes in the Company’s material cash requirements under its contractual obligations as discussed in its most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Other Material Cash Requirements. In addition to contractual obligations, the Company’s material cash requirements also includes compensation and benefits expenses for its employees, which were $7.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The Company also has material cash requirements for occupancy and equipment expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization of $467,000, related to rental expenses, general maintenance and cleaning supplies, guard services, software licenses and other miscellaneous expenses, which were $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. 67 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part I, Item 2 of this report under “Management of Market Risk”. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2021. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, there were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting. 68 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. The Company is not involved in any pending legal proceedings as a plaintiff or a defendant other than routine legal proceeding occurring in the ordinary course of business. At March 31, 2022, the Company was not involved in any legal proceedings the outcome of which management believes would be material to its financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our 2021 Form 10-K and the risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our other SEC filings, which could materially affect our businesses, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our Risk Factors from those disclosed in Item 1A of our 2021 Form 10-K or our other SEC filings. The Company’s net income and earnings per share for the first quarter of 2022 have been adversely affected by a significant write-off and write-down related to its relationship with Grain Technologies, Inc . The Company’s results may be further adversely affected as a result of its lending relationship with Grain. As discussed under Item 2, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations‎, Factors Affecting the Comparability of Results, Write-off and Write-Down of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has taken a significant write-off and write-down related to microloans originated by FinTech startup company Grain Technologies, Inc. (“Grain”) as a result of cyberfraud in the application for microloans originated by Grain. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, ‎ if a microloan originated by Grain is found to be fraudulent, becomes 120 days delinquent upon 120 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of ‎Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been ‎complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The ‎microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.”‎ During the first quarter of 2022, the Company has assessed ‎the collectability of the remaining Grain Receivable and has determined that it is appropriate to write-off and write-down a portion thereof. The Company continues to closely monitor its portfolio of consumer loans originated by Grain as well as Grain’s refinement of ‎solutions for detecting and preventing cyber fraud in the application for microloans. The Company has requested, and Grain has ‎agreed, that no new microloans be originated until further notice and that further extensions of credit to an existing microloan ‎borrower only be made upon confirmation that such borrower is not fraudulent. The Company also evaluates on a monthly basis the ‎likelihood that Grain will be able to make payments on the Grain Receivable. If, as a result of its continuing evaluation, the ‎Company determines that Grain will not be able to make timely payments on the Grain Receivable or additional Grain originated ‎microloans are found to be fraudulent, the Bank may be required to write-off some or all of the remaining value of the Grain ‎Receivable, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. Further, like other start-up companies, there is a higher level ‎of risk that Grain may not be able to execute its business plan and may fail. In the event Grain were to cease operations, and ‎although it has considered contingency plans, the Bank may have greater difficulty in servicing and collecting the microloan ‎portfolio. In such a case, the level the Bank has provided for in its allowance for loan losses for its microloan portfolio may be ‎inadequate and it may need to increase its provision for loan losses, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. As a ‎consequence of such events the Bank may determine it appropriate to terminate its relationship with Grain and the value of the ‎Company’s $1.0 million equity investment in Grain could become impaired.‎ Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company had no unregistered sales of equity securities and the Company did not repurchase any equity securities. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. None 69 Item 5. Other Information. None 70 Item 6.

See accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 7 Table of Contents Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K). This report should be read in conjunction with our 2022 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. While our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, all of our international operations are reported on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of June, July and August are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended September 9, 2023 and September 3, 2022, and the months of January through August are reflected in our results for the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023 and September 3, 2022. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates. Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. 8 Table of Contents Our Divisions We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada; 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe; 6) Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region. Net revenue of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 FLNA $ 5,954 $ 5,563 $ 17,441 $ 15,583 QFNA 747 713 2,208 2,101 PBNA 7,161 6,635 19,714 18,108 LatAm 3,055 2,517 7,688 6,406 Europe 3,704 3,646 9,018 8,466 AMESA 1,615 1,726 4,202 4,426 APAC 1,217 1,171 3,350 3,306 Total $ 23,453 $ 21,971 $ 63,621 $ 58,396 Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products to our customers. The following tables reflect the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our convenient food business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue: 12 Weeks Ended 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 Beverages (a) Convenient Foods Beverages (a) Convenient Foods LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 50 % 50 % 55 % 45 % AMESA 30 % 70 % 35 % 65 % APAC 25 % 75 % 25 % 75 % PepsiCo 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % 9 Table of Contents 36 Weeks Ended 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 Beverages (a) Convenient Foods Beverages (a) Convenient Foods LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 50 % 50 % 50 % 50 % AMESA 30 % 70 % 35 % 65 % APAC 25 % 75 % 25 % 75 % PepsiCo 40 % 60 % 45 % 55 % (a) Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe divisions, is over 35 % of our consolidated net revenue in the 12 weeks ended September 9, 2023, approximately 35 % of our consolidated net revenue in the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023, and approximately 40 % of our consolidated net revenue in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue but lower operating margin as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. Operating profit of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 FLNA $ 1,669 $ 1,588 $ 4,915 $ 4,332 QFNA 135 122 452 416 PBNA (a) (b) (c) 970 784 2,176 4,869 LatAm (d) 593 463 1,549 1,206 Europe (a) (e) (f) 659 564 1,206 ( 369 ) AMESA 238 268 656 738 APAC 239 199 689 620 Total divisions 4,503 3,988 11,643 11,812 Corporate unallocated expenses (g) (h) ( 488 ) ( 635 ) ( 1,340 ) ( 1,115 ) Total $ 4,015 $ 3,353 $ 10,303 $ 10,697 (a) In the 12 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we recorded a charge of $ 8 million and $ 6 million in our PBNA and Europe divisions, respectively, associated with the Juice Transaction.

The new guidance requires disclosure of key terms of the program, including a description of the payment terms, payment timing and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided to the finance provider or intermediary. Other requirements include the disclosure of the amount that remains unpaid as of the end of the reporting period, a description of where these obligations are presented in the balance sheet and a rollforward of the obligation during the annual period. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward, which is effective in fiscal year 2024 with early adoption permitted. We currently plan to adopt the rollforward guidance when effective. See Note 13 for disclosures currently required under this guidance. Note 3 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $ 2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 10 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 35 % for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. The total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 15 % 1 % 25 % 10 % 25 % 5 % 4 % 15 % 11 Table of Contents A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 Cost of sales $ 4 $ 1 $ 10 $ 6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 79 50 278 117 Other pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense (a) — — ( 1 ) 3 Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 83 $ 51 $ 287 $ 126 After-tax amount $ 67 $ 40 $ 228 $ 101 Impact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ ( 0.05 ) $ ( 0.03 ) $ ( 0.16 ) $ ( 0.07 ) 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 through 9/9/2023 FLNA $ 6 $ 4 $ 19 $ 10 $ 229 QFNA — 1 — 1 19 PBNA 8 4 18 9 244 LatAm 8 3 19 17 190 Europe 44 21 185 40 528 AMESA 5 — 10 5 92 APAC 2 4 7 8 84 Corporate 10 14 30 33 259 83 51 288 123 1,645 Other pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense (a) — — ( 1 ) 3 97 Total $ 83 $ 51 $ 287 $ 126 $ 1,742 (a) Income amount represents adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts. 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 through 9/9/2023 Severance and other employee costs $ 39 $ 10 $ 181 $ 41 $ 988 Asset impairments 1 7 1 7 191 Other costs 43 34 105 78 563 Total $ 83 $ 51 $ 287 $ 126 $ 1,742 Severance and other employee costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits, as well as voluntary separation arrangements.

A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan activity for the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023 is as follows: Severance and Other Employee Costs Asset Impairments Other Costs Total Liability as of December 31, 2022 $ 188 $ — $ 8 $ 196 2023 restructuring charges 181 1 105 287 Cash payments ( 174 ) — ( 109 ) ( 283 ) Non-cash charges and translation ( 8 ) ( 1 ) 1 ( 8 ) Liability as of September 9, 2023 $ 187 $ — $ 5 $ 192 The majority of the restructuring accrual at September 9, 2023 is expected to be paid by the end of 2023. 12 Table of Contents Other Productivity Initiatives There were no charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives described above. See Notes 1, 4 and 9 for impairment and other charges/credits taken related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges. Note 4 - Intangible Assets During the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022 , macroeconomic factors, sanctions and other regulations as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict indicated a material deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital. These factors required us to perform a quantitative assessment, despite the absence of a material adverse impact on these assets’ financial performance (e.g., sales, operating profit, cash flows). The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value, with the decrease in the fair value primarily attributable to a significant increase in the weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the macroeconomic uncertainty in Russia. As a result of the quantitative assessment, in the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $ 1.2 billion ($ 958 million after-tax or $ 0.69 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, related to our juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. See Note 1 for further information. During the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we repositioned or discontinued certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. As a result, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges (included in brand portfolio impairment charges) of $ 241 million ($ 193 million after-tax or $ 0.14 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to indefinite-lived intangible assets. See Note 1 for further information. For further information on indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K.

The assessment included both agreed and unagreed issues. On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals conference. In 2022, we came to an agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. As a result, we adjusted our reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax benefit of $ 198 million ($ 0.14 per share) in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022. Tax years 2014 through 2019 remain under audit for other issues. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information. There were no new tax amounts recognized in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023 associated with this agreement. Note 6 - Share-Based Compensation The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 Share-based compensation expense – equity awards $ 88 $ 77 $ 267 $ 233 Share-based compensation expense – liability awards 7 4 19 16 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — — 3 Total $ 95 $ 81 $ 286 $ 252 The following table summarizes share-based awards granted under the terms of the PepsiCo, Inc.

All grant activity is disclosed at target. We granted long-term cash awards to certain executive officers and other senior executives with an aggregate target value of $ 20 million and $ 18 million during the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023 and September 3, 2022, respectively. For the 12 weeks ended September 9, 2023 and September 3, 2022, our grants of stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards were nominal. Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: 36 Weeks Ended 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 Expected life 7 years 7 years Risk-free interest rate 4.2 % 1.8 % Expected volatility 16 % 16 % Expected dividend yield 2.7 % 2.5 % 15 Table of Contents Note 7 - Pension and Retiree Medical Benefits In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we recognized pre-tax settlement charges of $ 59 million ($ 46 million after-tax or $ 0.03 per share) and $ 190 million ($ 147 million after-tax or $ 0.11 per share), respectively, primarily related to a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan due to lump sum distributions to retired or terminated employees. The settlement charge was triggered when the cumulative lump sum distributions exceeded the total annual service and interest cost in 2022. Related plan assets and benefit obligations were remeasured using remeasurement date assumptions . In the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we transferred pension and retiree medical obligations of $ 145 million and related assets to TBG in connection with the Juice Transaction and, as a result, recognized a pre-tax curtailment gain of $ 16 million in a U.S. retiree medical plan. The components of net periodic benefit cost/(income) for pension and retiree medical plans are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 Service cost $ 76 $ 111 $ 10 $ 13 $ 7 $ 8 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income: Interest cost 137 111 34 23 7 5 Expected return on plan assets ( 197 ) ( 206 ) ( 45 ) ( 55 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) Amortization of prior service credits ( 6 ) ( 6 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Amortization of net losses/(gains) 16 35 3 8 ( 6 ) ( 3 ) Settlement/curtailment losses — 59 — — — — Total other pension and retiree medical benefits income ( 50 ) ( 7 ) ( 9 ) ( 25 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) Total $ 26 $ 104 $ 1 $ ( 12 ) $ 4 $ 4 36 Weeks Ended Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 Service cost $ 227 $ 340 $ 28 $ 47 $ 20 $ 25 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income: Interest cost 411 286 93 63 24 13 Expected return on plan assets ( 590 ) ( 637 ) ( 126 ) ( 153 ) ( 9 ) ( 11 ) Amortization of prior service credits ( 18 ) ( 19 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 4 ) ( 6 ) Amortization of net losses/(gains) 48 103 8 20 ( 18 ) ( 9 ) Settlement/curtailment losses/(gains) — 190 — — — ( 16 ) Special termination benefits ( 1 ) 9 — — — — Total other pension and retiree medical benefits income ( 150 ) ( 68 ) ( 26 ) ( 71 ) ( 7 ) ( 29 ) Total $ 77 $ 272 $ 2 $ ( 24 ) $ 13 $ ( 4 ) We regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. 16 Table of Contents In the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023 and September 3, 2022, we made discretionary contributions of $ 250 million and $ 150 million, respectively, to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans, and $ 17 million and $ 10 million, respectively, to our international defined benefit plans. Note 8 - Debt Obligations In the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023, we issued the following notes: Interest Rate Maturity Date Principal Amount (a) Floating rate February 2026 $ 350 4.550 % February 2026 $ 500 4.450 % May 2028 $ 650 4.450 % February 2033 $ 1,000 4.650 % February 2053 $ 500 (a) Excludes debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums. The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper. In the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023, $ 2.3 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes matured and were paid. In addition, in the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023, we discharged via legal defeasance $ 94 million outstanding principal amount of certain notes originally issued by our subsidiary, The Quaker Oats Company, following the deposit of $ 102 million of U.S. government securities with the Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, in the fourth quarter of 2022. As of September 9, 2023, we had $ 5.1 billion of commercial paper outstanding, excluding discounts. In the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement), which expires on May 26, 2028. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 4.2 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $ 0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.95 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.8 billion five-year credit agreement, dated as of May 27, 2022. Also in the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires on May 24, 2024. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 4.2 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.95 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.8 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of May 27, 2022. Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of September 9, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement. 17 Table of Contents Note 9 - Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. There have been no material changes during the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023 with respect to our risk management policies or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of September 9, 2023 was $ 219 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of September 9, 2023. The notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of September 9, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows: Notional Amounts (a) 9/9/2023 12/31/2022 Commodity $ 1.6 $ 1.8 Foreign exchange $ 2.9 $ 3.0 Interest rate $ 1.3 $ 1.3 Net investment (b) $ 2.9 $ 2.9 (a) In billions. (b) The total notional of our net investment hedge consists of non-derivative debt instruments. As of September 9, 2023, approximately 13 % of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to 1 % as of December 31, 2022. Debt Securities Available-for-Sale Investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities impact earnings only when such securities are sold, or an allowance for expected credit losses or impairment is recognized. We regularly evaluate our investment portfolio for expected credit losses and impairment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the extent to which the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost; the financial condition of the issuer, including the credit quality, and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a debt security has a credit loss or is impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular debt security. There were no unrealized gains and losses on our investments as of September 9, 2023. Impairment charges related to our investments for the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023 were not material. 18 Table of Contents TBG Investment In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39 % noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. We have significant influence over our investment in TBG and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of TBG’s earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). See Note 12 for further information. In the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023, we recorded our proportionate share of TBG’s earnings, which includes an impairment of TBG’s indefinite-lived intangible assets, and recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment, both of which resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of $ 113 million ($ 86 million after-tax or $ 0.06 per share), recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our PBNA division. We estimated the fair value of our ownership in TBG using discounted cash flows and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in TBG, which we categorized as Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in the fair value hierarchy. Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of September 9, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are categorized as follows: 9/9/2023 12/31/2022 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Available-for-sale debt securities (b) 2 $ 558 $ — $ 660 $ — Index funds (c) 1 $ 265 $ — $ 257 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (d) 2 $ 14 $ — $ 14 $ — Deferred compensation (e) 2 $ — $ 439 $ — $ 434 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (f) 2 $ 11 $ 37 $ 24 $ 22 Interest rate (f) 2 — 161 — 164 Commodity (g) 2 — 49 2 60 $ 11 $ 247 $ 26 $ 246 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (f) 2 $ 18 $ 18 $ 21 $ 21 Commodity (g) 2 10 17 11 51 $ 28 $ 35 $ 32 $ 72 Total derivatives at fair value (h) $ 39 $ 282 $ 58 $ 318 Total $ 876 $ 721 $ 989 $ 752 (a) Fair value hierarchy levels are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) in both years. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities. (b) Primarily related to our investment in Celsius convertible preferred stock. The fair value of our investment approximates the transaction price and any accrued dividends, as well as the amortized cost. As of September 9, 2023, $ 558 million were classified as other assets. As of December 31, 2022, $ 3 million, $ 104 million and $ 553 million were classified as cash equivalents, short-term investments and other assets, respectively. (c) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (d) Based primarily on the price of our common stock. 19 Table of Contents (e) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections. (f) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates. (g) Primarily based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements. (h) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on our balance sheet as of September 9, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of September 9, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 40 billion and $ 35 billion, respectively, based upon prices of identical or similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs.

In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBG’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. We have significant influence over our investment in TBG and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of TBG’s earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). As a result of this transaction, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 3.3 billion ($ 2.9 billion after-tax or $ 2.08 per share) in our PBNA and Europe divisions, including $ 520 million related to the remeasurement of our 39 % ownership in TBG at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, discounted cash flo ws and an option pricing model related to our 24 Table of Contents liquidation preference in TBG . See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information. In the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 3.3 billion ($ 2.9 billion after-tax or $ 2.07 per share) in our PBNA and Europe divisions. In the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023, we recognized i mpairment charges related to our TBG investment. See Note 9 for further information. Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures, primarily consulting, advisory and other professional fees.

(b) Recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Note 13 - Supply Chain Financing Arrangements As part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of September 9, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $ 1.8 billion and $ 1.7 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable are to suppliers participating in these financing arrangements. 25 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL REVIEW Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies and estimates below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2022 Form 10-K. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Income Taxes In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur. Our Business Risks This Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act 26 Table of Contents are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine; future demand for PepsiCo’s products; damage to PepsiCo’s reputation or brand image; product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety; PepsiCo’s ability to compete effectively; PepsiCo’s ability to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce or effectively manage changes in our workforce; water scarcity; changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer; disruption of PepsiCo’s manufacturing operations or supply chain, including continued increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs; political or social conditions in the markets where PepsiCo’s products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCo’s ability to grow its business in developing and emerging markets; changes in economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems; failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions; PepsiCo’s reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems; climate change or measures to address climate change; strikes or work stoppages; failure to realize benefits from PepsiCo’s productivity initiatives; deterioration in estimates and underlying assumptions regarding future performance that can result in an impairment charge; fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCo’s credit ratings; imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo’s products; imposition of limitations on the marketing or sale of PepsiCo’s products; changes in laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials; failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities; failure to adequately protect PepsiCo’s intellectual property rights or infringement on intellectual property rights of others; failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other risks and uncertainties including those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2022 Form 10-K and in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain During the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023 , we continued to experience significantly higher operating costs, including on transportation, labor and commodity (including energy) costs, which we expect to continue for the remainder of 2023. Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. A number of external factors, including the deadly conflict in Ukraine, the inflationary cost environment, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted 27 Table of Contents and may continue to impact transportation, labor and commodity availability costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices. Risks Associated with Climate Change Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. These new or increased legal or regulatory requirements, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could result in significant increased costs and additional investments in facilities and equipment. However, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations. Risks Associated with International Operations In the 12 weeks ended September 9, 2023, our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of June, July and August. In the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023, our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January through August. In the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023, our operations outside of the United States generated 42% of our consolidated net revenue, with Mexico, Canada, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa comprising approximately 24% of our consolidated net revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk in the international markets in whi ch our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the 12 weeks ended September 9, 2023, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 2 percentage points primarily due to declines in the Russian ruble and Egyptian pound, partially offset by an appreciation of the Mexican peso . In the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 2 percentage points primarily due to declines in the Egyptian pound, Russian ruble, South African rand and Canadian dollar, partially offset by an appreciation of the Mexican peso . Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, and natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely, including risks of additional impairments or write-offs, and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, including i mpairment charges. Also see Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for charges taken as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022. 28 Table of Contents See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of September 9, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of these items. Risks Associated with the Deadly Conflict in Ukraine In addition to the risks associated with international operations discussed above, we continue to face risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine. The conflict has continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty and has impacted our operations in Ukraine. We have suspended sales to our customers of Pepsi-Cola and certain of our other global beverage brands, our discretionary capital investments and advertising and promotional activities in Russia, which has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business. We continue to offer our other products in Russia. The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risks, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets and other corporate banking services, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets or additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees, customers, operations or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K, for a discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, including i mpairment charges. Also see Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for charges taken as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022. The extent of the impact of these tragic events on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the conflic t, regional instability and ongoing and additional financial and economic sanctions, export controls and other legislation imposed by governments. We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve and to identify actions to potentially m itigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. We sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of 29 Table of Contents packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. OECD Global Minimum Tax Numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) model rules that propose a global minimum tax rate of 15% and European Union member states have agreed to implement the global minimum tax. Certain countries, including European Union member states, have enacted or are expected to enact legislation to be effective as early as 2024, with widespread implementation of a global minimum tax expected by 2025. As the legislation becomes effective in countries in which we do business, our taxes could increase and negatively impact our provision for income taxes. We will continue to monitor pending legislation and implementation by individual countries and evaluate the potential impact on our business in future periods. Retail Landscape Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the continued growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Cautionary statements included above and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” in our 2022 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. Results of Operations – Consolidated Review Consolidated Results Volume Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Financial Results – Volume” included in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information on volume. Unit volume growth adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures. Acquisitions and divestitures, when used in this report, reflect mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. Further, unit volume growth excludes the impact of an additional week of results every five or six years (53 rd reporting week), where applicable, including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. 30 Table of Contents We report all of our international operations on a monthly calendar basis. The 12 weeks ended September 9, 2023 and September 3, 2022 include volume outside of North America for the months of June, July and August. The 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023 and September 3, 2022 include volume outside of North America for the months of January through August. Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 Change 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 Change Net revenue $ 23,453 $ 21,971 7 % $ 63,621 $ 58,396 9 % Operating profit $ 4,015 $ 3,353 20 % $ 10,303 $ 10,697 (4) % Operating margin 17.1 % 15.3 % 1.8 16.2 % 18.3 % (2.1) See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. 12 Weeks Operating profit grew 20% and operating margin improved 1.8 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by effective net pricing and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 17-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, a decrease in organic volume and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Corporate unallocated expenses reflect an 8-percentage-point favorable impact of net mark-to-market gains on commodity derivatives, partially offset by an increase in expenses related to our ongoing business initiatives. The operating margin improvement primarily reflects the favorable impact of productivity savings and net mark-to-market gains on commodity derivatives. 36 Weeks Operating profit decreased 4% and operating margin declined 2.1 percentage points. Operating profit performance was primarily driven by certain operating cost increases, a 34-percentage-point unfavorable impact of the prior-year gain associated with the Juice Transaction, a 23-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, a decrease in organic volume and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by effective net pricing, productivity savings, a 15-percentage-point favorable impact of the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict compared to the prior year, and a 5-percentage-point favorable impact of the brand portfolio impairment charges compared to the prior year. Corporate unallocated expenses reflect an increase in expenses related to our ongoing business initiatives. The operating margin decline primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of the prior-year gain associated with the Juice Transaction, partially offset by the favorable impact of the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the brand portfolio impairment charges compared to the prior year. 31 Table of Contents Other Consolidated Results 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 Change 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 Change Other pension and retiree medical benefits income $ 62 $ 36 $ 26 $ 183 $ 168 $ 15 Net interest expense and other $ (201) $ (190) $ (11) $ (602) $ (666) $ 64 Tax rate 19.6 % 14.9 % 20.8 % 17.2 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo (a) $ 3,092 $ 2,702 14 % $ 7,772 $ 8,392 (7) % Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted (a) $ 2.24 $ 1.95 15 % $ 5.62 $ 6.04 (7) % (a) For the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023, the gain associated with the Juice Transaction in the prior year negatively impacted both the net income attributable to PepsiCo performance and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share performance, partially offset by the impairment of intangible assets recorded in the prior year. See Notes 4 and 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 12 Weeks Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $26 million, primarily reflecting a prior-year settlement charge of $59 million. In addition, the increase in other pension and retiree medical benefits income reflects lower amortization of net losses on pension obligations and a higher rate of expected return on plan assets, partially offset by higher interest cost and recognition of fixed income losses on plan assets, all driven primarily by higher interest rates. Net interest expense and other increased $11 million, primarily due to higher interest rates on debt and higher average debt balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on average cash balances and higher average cash balances. The reported tax rate increased 4.7 percentage points, primarily reflecting the prior-year impact of an adjustment to reserves for uncertain tax positions as a result of our agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 to 2016 audit. 36 Weeks Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $15 million, primarily due to a prior-year settlement charge of $190 million. In addition, the increase in other pension and retiree medical benefits income reflects lower amortization of net losses on pension obligations and a higher rate of expected return on plan assets, partially offset by higher interest cost and recognition of fixed income losses on plan assets, all driven primarily by higher interest rates. Net interest expense and other decreased $64 million, primarily due to higher interest rates on average cash balances and gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability, partially offset by higher interest rates on debt and higher average debt balances. The reported tax rate increased 3.6 percentage points, primarily reflecting the prior-year impact of the Juice Transaction as well as an adjustment to reserves for uncertain tax positions as a result of our agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 to 2016 audit . Results of Operations – Division Review While our financial results in North America are reported on a 12-week basis, all of our international operations are reported on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of June, July and August are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended September 9, 2023 and September 3, 2022, and the months January through August are reflected in our results for the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023 and September 3, 2022. 32 Table of Contents In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries. See “Our Business Risks,” “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with GAAP.

(b) Excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In certain instances, the impact of organic volume on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume change disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between bottler case sales and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE). We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue. Operating Profit, Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis Operating profit adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit growth adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures.

These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing, productivity savings and a 4-percentage-point favorable impact of a remeasurement gain on one of our investments. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 22 percentage points, primarily due to weakening of the Egyptian pound. 36 Weeks Net revenue decreased 5%, primarily reflecting a 25-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, driven primarily by the weakening of the Egyptian pound, and a net organic volume decline, partially offset by effective net pricing. Convenient foods unit volume declined 5%, primarily reflecting a double-digit decline in South Africa, partially offset by double-digit growth in the Middle East and low-single-digit growth in Pakistan. Additionally, India experienced a mid-single-digit decline. Beverage unit volume grew 2%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in India and mid-single-digit growth in the Middle East, partially offset by a double-digit decline in Pakistan and a low-single-digit decline in Nigeria. Operating profit decreased 11%, primarily reflecting a 69-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily packaging materials, grains and cooking oil, largely driven by transaction-related foreign exchange. Operating profit performance was also negatively impacted by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing and productivity savings. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 22 percentage points, primarily due to weakening of the Egyptian pound. 39 Table of Contents APAC 12 Weeks Net revenue increased 4%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and net organic volume growth.

Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below 40 Table of Contents and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q are discussed below: Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, gain associated with the Juice Transaction, impairment of intangible assets, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Productivity Plan, charges associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, the gain associated with the Juice Transaction, impairment and other charges/credits comprised of Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges, and the impact of settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and where applicable, the impact of the 53 rd reporting week, including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash 41 Table of Contents available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-Q are impacted by the following items in each of the following periods: 12 Weeks Ended 9/9/2023 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 10,675 $ 12,778 $ 8,757 $ 6 $ 4,015 $ 760 $ 3,092 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 16 (16) 69 — (85) (21) (64) Restructuring and impairment charges (4) 4 (79) — 83 17 66 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (11) — 11 2 9 Impairment and other charges/credits — — 1 (6) 5 1 4 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 10,687 $ 12,766 $ 8,737 $ — $ 4,029 $ 759 $ 3,107 12 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Gain associated with the Juice Transaction Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 10,308 $ 11,663 $ 8,295 $ 14 $ 1 $ 3,353 $ 36 $ 475 $ 2,702 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (54) 54 (112) — — 166 — 40 126 Restructuring and impairment charges (1) 1 (50) — — 51 — 11 40 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (5) — — 5 — 2 3 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction — — — (14) — 14 — 3 11 Impairment and other charges/credits (11) 11 6 — (1) 6 — 3 3 Pension and retiree medical-related impact — — — — — — 59 13 46 Tax benefit related to the IRS audit — — — — — — — 284 (284) Tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — — — — (86) 86 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 10,242 $ 11,729 $ 8,134 $ — $ — $ 3,595 $ 95 $ 745 $ 2,733 42 Table of Contents 36 Weeks Ended 9/9/2023 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income/(expense) Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 28,784 $ 34,837 $ 24,528 $ 6 $ 10,303 $ 183 $ 2,053 $ 59 $ 7,772 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 3 (3) 20 — (23) — (6) — (17) Restructuring and impairment charges (10) 10 (278) — 288 (1) 60 1 226 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (20) — 20 — 4 — 16 Impairment and other charges/credits 5 (5) (101) (6) 102 — 29 — 73 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 28,782 $ 34,839 $ 24,149 $ — $ 10,690 $ 182 $ 2,140 $ 60 $ 8,070 36 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Gain associated with the Juice Transaction Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 27,156 $ 31,240 $ 22,262 $ (3,321) $ 1,602 $ 10,697 $ 168 $ 1,756 $ 51 $ 8,392 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 1 (1) 43 — — (44) — (11) — (33) Restructuring and impairment charges (6) 6 (117) — — 123 3 25 1 100 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (63) — — 63 6 12 — 57 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction — — — 3,321 — (3,321) — (452) — (2,869) Impairment and other charges/credits (152) 152 (123) — (1,602) 1,877 — 350 — 1,527 Pension and retiree medical-related impact — — — — — — 174 39 — 135 Tax benefit related to the IRS audit — — — — — — — 284 — (284) Tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — — — — (86) — 86 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 26,999 $ 31,397 $ 22,002 $ — $ — $ 9,395 $ 351 $ 1,917 $ 52 $ 7,111 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. 43 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 Change 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 Change Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, GAAP measure $ 2.24 $ 1.95 15 % $ 5.62 $ 6.04 (7) % Mark-to-market net impact (0.05) 0.09 (0.01) (0.02) Restructuring and impairment charges 0.05 0.03 0.16 0.07 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges 0.01 — 0.01 0.04 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction — 0.01 — (2.07) Impairment and other charges/credits — 0.01 0.05 1.10 Pension and retiree medical-related impact — 0.03 — 0.10 Tax benefit related to the IRS audit — (0.20) — (0.20) Tax expense related to the TCJ Act — 0.06 — 0.06 Core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, non-GAAP measure $ 2.25 $ 1.97 (a) 14 % $ 5.83 $ 5.12 14 % Impact of foreign exchange translation 2 2 Growth in core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP measure 16 % 16 % (a) Does not sum due to rounding. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. Plan to date through September 9, 2023, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.7 billion, including cash expenditures of $1.3 billion. For the remainder of 2023, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $200 million, and cash expenditures of approximately $200 million. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures through 2025, with the balance to be incurred through 2028. Charges include severance and other employee costs, asset impairments and other costs. 44 Table of Contents See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K, for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures, primarily consulting, advisory and other professional fees. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Gain Associated with the Juice Transaction We recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PBNA and Europe divisions. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Impairment and Other Charges/Credits We recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below. Russia-Ukraine Conflict Charges In connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs. We also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in 2022. See Notes 1 and 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges We recognized intangible asset and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands. We also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in 2022. See Notes 1 and 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Other Impairment Charges We recognized impairment charges primarily related to our investment in TBG. See Notes 1 and 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest cost, partially offset by curtailment gains resulting from the Juice Transaction. See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Tax Benefit Related to the IRS Audit We recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Tax Expense Related to the TCJ Act Tax expense related to the TCJ Act reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 45 Table of Contents Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See “Our Business Risks” and Notes 8 and 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the conflict. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the Russia-Ukraine conflict may have on our business and financial results. See “Our Business Risks,” Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information related to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business and financial results. As of September 9, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of September 9, 2023, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.3 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. See “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion of the TCJ Act. Supply chain financing arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. See Note 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of supply chain financing arrangements. Operating Activities During the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $7.6 billion, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $6.3 billion in the prior-year period. The increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects favorable operating profit performance, partially offset by unfavorable working capital comparisons. Investing Activities During the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023 , net cash used for investing activities was $2.4 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending. 46 Table of Contents We regularly review our plans with respect to ne t capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs. Financing Activities During the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $34 million, primarily reflecting the net proceeds from short-term borrowings of $5.0 billion and the proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $3.0 billion, partially offset by return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $5.7 billion and payments of long-term debt borrowings of $2.3 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 10, 2022, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on February 11, 2022 and will expire on February 28, 2026. In addition, on February 9, 2023, we announced a 10% increase in our annualized dividend to $5.06 per share from $4.60 per share, effective with the dividend paid in June 2023. We expect to return a total of approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2023, comprising dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.0 billion. Free Cash Flow The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow, see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 36 Weeks Ended 9/9/2023 9/3/2022 Net cash provided by operating activities, GAAP measure $ 7,630 $ 6,306 Capital spending (2,537) (2,556) Sales of property, plant and equipment 131 228 Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ 5,224 $ 3,978 We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2022 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information. 47 Table of Contents Material Changes in Line Items in Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated statement of income are discussed in “Results of Operations – Consolidated Review,” “Results of Operations – Division Review” and “Items Affecting Comparability.” Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows are discussed in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated balance sheet are discussed below: Total Assets As of September 9, 2023, total assets were $100.0 billion, compared to $92.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in total assets is primarily driven by the following line items: Change (a) Reference Cash and cash equivalents $ 5.1 Statement of Cash Flows Accounts and notes receivable, less allowance $ 1.6 (b) Property, Plant and Equipment, net $ 0.6 (c) Other Assets $ 0.6 (d) Total Liabilities As of September 9, 2023, total liabilities were $81.0 billion, compared to $74.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in total liabilities is primarily driven by the following line items: Change (a) Reference Short-term debt obligations $ 5.5 (e) (a) In billions. (b) Primarily reflects favorable operating performance. (c) Primarily reflects capital spending, partially offset by depreciation. (d) Primarily reflects increases in operating leases, net of right-of-use asset amortization, as well as discretionary contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans. See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information related to pension and retiree medical benefits. (e) Primarily reflects issuances of commercial paper. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Total Equity See our condensed consolidated statement of equity and Notes 9 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 48 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 9, 2023, the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, and Equity for the twelve and thirty-six weeks ended September 9, 2023 and September 3, 2022, the related Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the thirty-six weeks ended September 9, 2023 and September 3, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the fiscal year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 8, 2023, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York October 10, 2023 49 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the 12 weeks ended September 9, 2023, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses in phases over the next several years. In connection with these ERP implementations, we are updating and will continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. During the 12 weeks ended September 9, 2023, we continued implementing these systems, resulting in changes that materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with this multi-year productivity plan and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K). This report should be read in conjunction with our 2022 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. While our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, all of our international operations are reported on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of March, April and May are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended June 17, 2023 and June 11, 2022, and the months of January through May are reflected in our results for the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023 and June 11, 2022. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates. Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. 8 Table of Contents Our Divisions We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada; 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe; 6) Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region. Net revenue of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 FLNA $ 5,904 $ 5,181 $ 11,487 $ 10,020 QFNA 684 675 1,461 1,388 PBNA 6,755 6,120 12,553 11,473 LatAm 2,856 2,415 4,633 3,889 Europe 3,428 3,023 5,314 4,820 AMESA 1,568 1,696 2,587 2,700 APAC 1,127 1,115 2,133 2,135 Total $ 22,322 $ 20,225 $ 40,168 $ 36,425 9 Table of Contents Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products to our customers. The following tables reflect the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our convenient food business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue: 12 Weeks Ended 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Beverages (a) Convenient Foods Beverages (a) Convenient Foods LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 50 % 50 % 50 % 50 % AMESA 30 % 70 % 35 % 65 % APAC 25 % 75 % 25 % 75 % PepsiCo 40 % 60 % 45 % 55 % 24 Weeks Ended 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Beverages (a) Convenient Foods Beverages (a) Convenient Foods LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 50 % 50 % 50 % 50 % AMESA 30 % 70 % 30 % 70 % APAC 20 % 80 % 20 % 80 % PepsiCo 40 % 60 % 45 % 55 % (a) Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe divisions, is approximately 35 % of our consolidated net revenue in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023, and over 35 % of our consolidated net revenue in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue but lower operating margin as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. Operating profit of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 FLNA $ 1,647 $ 1,448 $ 3,246 $ 2,744 QFNA 129 135 317 294 PBNA (a) (b) (c) 723 651 1,206 4,085 LatAm (d) 592 420 956 743 Europe (a) (e) (f) 476 ( 797 ) 547 ( 933 ) AMESA 250 290 418 470 APAC 223 206 450 421 Total divisions 4,040 2,353 7,140 7,824 Corporate unallocated expenses (g) (h) ( 381 ) ( 276 ) ( 852 ) ( 480 ) Total $ 3,659 $ 2,077 $ 6,288 $ 7,344 (a) In the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we recorded a gain of $ 3,037 million and $ 298 million in our PBNA and Europe divisions, respectively, associated with the Juice Transaction.

See Note 9 for further information. (d) In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we made the decision to sell or discontinue certain non-strategic brands in our LatAm division.

The new guidance requires disclosure of key terms of the program, including a description of the payment terms, payment timing and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided to the finance provider or intermediary. Other requirements include the disclosure of the amount that remains unpaid as of the end of the reporting period, a description of where these obligations are presented in the balance sheet and a rollforward of the obligation during the annual period. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward, which is effective in fiscal year 2024 with early adoption permitted. We currently plan to adopt the rollforward guidance when effective. See Note 13 for disclosures currently required under this guidance. 11 Table of Contents Note 3 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $ 2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 10 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 35 % for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. The total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 15 % 1 % 25 % 10 % 25 % 5 % 4 % 15 % A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Cost of sales $ 3 $ — $ 6 $ 5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 89 45 199 67 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense/(income) (a) — 3 ( 1 ) 3 Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 92 $ 48 $ 204 $ 75 After-tax amount $ 63 $ 40 $ 161 $ 61 Impact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ ( 0.05 ) $ ( 0.03 ) $ ( 0.12 ) $ ( 0.04 ) 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 through 6/17/2023 FLNA $ 6 $ 3 $ 13 $ 6 $ 223 QFNA — — — — 19 PBNA 5 2 10 5 236 LatAm 6 8 11 14 182 Europe 52 12 141 19 484 AMESA — 3 5 5 87 APAC 4 3 5 4 82 Corporate 19 14 20 19 249 92 45 205 72 1,562 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense/(income) (a) — 3 ( 1 ) 3 97 Total $ 92 $ 48 $ 204 $ 75 $ 1,659 (a) Income amount represents adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts. 12 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 through 6/17/2023 Severance and other employee costs $ 50 $ 20 $ 142 $ 31 $ 949 Asset impairments — — — — 190 Other costs 42 28 62 44 520 Total $ 92 $ 48 $ 204 $ 75 $ 1,659 Severance and other employee costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits, as well as voluntary separation arrangements.

A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan activity for the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023 is as follows: Severance and Other Employee Costs Other Costs Total Liability as of December 31, 2022 $ 188 $ 8 $ 196 2023 restructuring charges 142 62 204 Cash payments ( 120 ) ( 67 ) ( 187 ) Non-cash charges and translation ( 7 ) — ( 7 ) Liability as of June 17, 2023 $ 203 $ 3 $ 206 The majority of the restructuring accrual at June 17, 2023 is expected to be paid by the end of 2023. Other Productivity Initiatives There were no charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives described above. See Notes 1, 4 and 9 for impairment and other charges/credits taken related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges. 13 Table of Contents Note 4 - Intangible Assets During the 12 weeks ended June 11, 2022 , macroeconomic factors, sanctions and other regulations as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict indicated a material deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital. These factors required us to perform a quantitative assessment, despite the absence of a material adverse impact on these assets’ financial performance (e.g., sales, operating profit, cash flows). The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value, with the decrease in the fair value primarily attributable to a significant increase in the weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the macroeconomic uncertainty in Russia. As a result of the quantitative assessment, in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $ 1.2 billion ($ 958 million after-tax or $ 0.69 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, related to our juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. See Note 1 for further information. During the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we repositioned or discontinued certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. As a result, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges (included in brand portfolio impairment charges) of $ 241 million ($ 193 million after-tax or $ 0.14 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to indefinite-lived intangible assets. See Note 1 for further information. For further information on indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K.

The assessment included both agreed and unagreed issues. On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals conference. In 2022 , we came to an agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. As a result, we adjusted our reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. Tax years 2014 through 2019 remain under audit for other issues . See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information. There were no tax amounts recognized in the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023 and June 11, 2022 associated with this agreement. Note 6 - Share-Based Compensation The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Share-based compensation expense – equity awards $ 86 $ 75 $ 179 $ 156 Share-based compensation expense – liability awards 6 7 12 12 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — — 3 Restructuring charges ( 1 ) 1 — — Total $ 91 $ 83 $ 191 $ 171 The following table summarizes share-based awards granted under the terms of the PepsiCo, Inc.

All grant activity is disclosed at target. We granted long-term cash awards to certain executive officers and other senior executives with an aggregate target value of $ 20 million and $ 18 million during the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023 and June 11, 2022, respectively. For the 12 weeks ended June 17, 2023 and June 11, 2022, our grants of stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards were nominal. Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: 24 Weeks Ended 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Expected life 7 years 7 years Risk-free interest rate 4.2 % 1.7 % Expected volatility 16 % 16 % Expected dividend yield 2.7 % 2.5 % 16 Table of Contents Note 7 - Pension and Retiree Medical Benefits In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we recognized a pre-tax settlement charge of $ 131 million ($ 101 million after-tax or $ 0.07 per share) in a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan due to lump sum distributions to retired or terminated employees. The settlement charge was triggered when the cumulative lump sum distributions exceeded the total annual service and interest cost in 2022. As a result, related plan assets and benefit obligations were remeasured using assumptions as of June 11, 2022, the remeasurement date. In the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we transferred pension and retiree medical obligations of $ 145 million and related assets to TBG in connection with the Juice Transaction and, as a result, recognized a pre-tax curtailment gain of $ 16 million in a U.S. retiree medical plan. The components of net periodic benefit cost/(income) for pension and retiree medical plans are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Service cost $ 75 $ 115 $ 10 $ 17 $ 7 $ 9 Other pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense: Interest cost 137 87 34 23 9 4 Expected return on plan assets ( 196 ) ( 216 ) ( 46 ) ( 56 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) Amortization of prior service credits ( 6 ) ( 7 ) — — ( 2 ) ( 2 ) Amortization of net losses/(gains) 16 35 3 7 ( 6 ) ( 3 ) Settlement/curtailment losses — 131 — — — — Special termination benefits — 3 — — — — Total other pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense ( 49 ) 33 ( 9 ) ( 26 ) ( 2 ) ( 5 ) Total $ 26 $ 148 $ 1 $ ( 9 ) $ 5 $ 4 24 Weeks Ended Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Service cost $ 151 $ 229 $ 18 $ 34 $ 13 $ 17 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income: Interest cost 274 175 59 40 17 8 Expected return on plan assets ( 393 ) ( 431 ) ( 81 ) ( 98 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) Amortization of prior service credits ( 12 ) ( 13 ) — — ( 3 ) ( 4 ) Amortization of net losses/(gains) 32 68 5 12 ( 12 ) ( 6 ) Settlement/curtailment losses — 131 — — — ( 16 ) Special termination benefits ( 1 ) 9 — — — — Total other pension and retiree medical benefits income ( 100 ) ( 61 ) ( 17 ) ( 46 ) ( 4 ) ( 25 ) Total $ 51 $ 168 $ 1 $ ( 12 ) $ 9 $ ( 8 ) We regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. 17 Table of Contents During the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023 and June 11, 2022, we made discretionary contributions of $ 125 million and $ 75 million, respectively, to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans, and $ 17 million and $ 10 million, respectively, to our international defined benefit plans. We expect to make an additional discretionary contribution of $ 125 million to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in the third quarter of 2023. Note 8 - Debt Obligations In the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023, we issued the following notes: Interest Rate Maturity Date Principal Amount (a) Floating rate February 2026 $ 350 4.550 % February 2026 $ 500 4.450 % May 2028 $ 650 4.450 % February 2033 $ 1,000 4.650 % February 2053 $ 500 (a) Excludes debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums. The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper. In the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023, $ 2.3 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes matured and were paid. In addition, in the 12 weeks ended June 17, 2023, we discharged via legal defeasance $ 94 million outstanding principal amount of certain notes originally issued by our subsidiary, The Quaker Oats Company, following the deposit of $ 102 million of U.S. government securities with the Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, in the fourth quarter of 2022. As of June 17, 2023, we had $ 3.6 billion of commercial paper outstanding, excluding discounts. In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement), which expires on May 26, 2028. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 4.2 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $ 0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.95 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.8 billion five-year credit agreement, dated as of May 27, 2022. Also in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires on May 24, 2024. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 4.2 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.95 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.8 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of May 27, 2022. Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of June 17, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement. 18 Table of Contents Note 9 - Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. There have been no material changes during the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023 with respect to our risk management policies or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of June 17, 2023 was $ 203 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of June 17, 2023. The notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of June 17, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows: Notional Amounts (a) 6/17/2023 12/31/2022 Commodity $ 1.7 $ 1.8 Foreign exchange $ 2.8 $ 3.0 Interest rate $ 1.3 $ 1.3 Net investment (b) $ 3.0 $ 2.9 (a) In billions. (b) The total notional of our net investment hedge consists of non-derivative debt instruments. As of June 17, 2023, approximately 10 % of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to 1 % as of December 31, 2022. Debt Securities Available-for-Sale Investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities impact earnings only when such securities are sold, or an allowance for expected credit losses or impairment is recognized. We regularly evaluate our investment portfolio for expected credit losses and impairment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the extent to which the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost; the financial condition of the issuer, including the credit quality, and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a debt security has a credit loss or is impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular debt security. There were no unrealized gains and losses on our investments as of June 17, 2023. Impairment charges related to our investments for the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023 were not material. 19 Table of Contents TBG Investment In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39 % noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. We have significant influence over our investment in TBG and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of TBG’s earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). See Note 12 for further information. In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023, we recorded our proportionate share of TBG’s earnings, which includes an impairment of TBG’s indefinite-lived intangible assets, and recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment, both of which resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of $ 113 million ($ 86 million after-tax or $ 0.06 per share), recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our PBNA division. We estimated the fair value of our ownership in TBG using discounted cash flows and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in TBG, which we categorized as Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in the fair value hierarchy. Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of June 17, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are categorized as follows: 6/17/2023 12/31/2022 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Available-for-sale debt securities (b) 2 $ 574 $ — $ 660 $ — Index funds (c) 1 $ 273 $ — $ 257 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (d) 2 $ 14 $ — $ 14 $ — Deferred compensation (e) 2 $ — $ 447 $ — $ 434 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (f) 2 $ 5 $ 43 $ 24 $ 22 Interest rate (f) 2 6 144 — 164 Commodity (g) 2 — 58 2 60 $ 11 $ 245 $ 26 $ 246 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (f) 2 $ 9 $ 37 $ 21 $ 21 Commodity (g) 2 7 33 11 51 $ 16 $ 70 $ 32 $ 72 Total derivatives at fair value (h) $ 27 $ 315 $ 58 $ 318 Total $ 888 $ 762 $ 989 $ 752 (a) Fair value hierarchy levels are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) in both years. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities. (b) Primarily related to our investment in Celsius Holdings, Inc. convertible preferred stock. The fair value of our investment approximates the transaction price and any accrued dividends, as well as the amortized cost. As of June 17, 2023, $ 16 million and $ 558 million were classified as short-term investments and other assets, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, $ 3 million, $ 104 million and $ 553 million were classified as cash equivalents, short-term investments and other assets, respectively. (c) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (d) Based primarily on the price of our common stock. 20 Table of Contents (e) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections. (f) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates. (g) Primarily based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements. (h) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on our balance sheet as of June 17, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of June 17, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 40 billion and $ 35 billion, respectively, based upon prices of identical or similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs. Losses/(gains) on our cash flow and net investment hedges are categorized as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (a) 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Foreign exchange $ 43 $ 26 $ 14 $ ( 17 ) Interest rate ( 37 ) 82 ( 30 ) 61 Commodity ( 15 ) ( 1 ) 28 ( 74 ) Net investment 71 ( 88 ) — — Total $ 62 $ 19 $ 12 $ ( 30 ) 24 Weeks Ended Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (a) 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Foreign exchange $ 59 $ 18 $ 15 $ ( 21 ) Interest rate ( 26 ) 79 ( 27 ) 81 Commodity 50 ( 190 ) 37 ( 152 ) Net investment 108 ( 139 ) — — Total $ 191 $ ( 232 ) $ 25 $ ( 92 ) (a) Foreign exchange derivative losses/(gains) are included in net revenue and cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/(gains) are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Commodity derivative losses/(gains) are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. See Note 11 for further information.

In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBG’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. We have significant influence over our investment in TBG and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of TBG’s earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). As a result of this transaction, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 3.3 billion ($ 2.9 billion after-tax or $ 2.08 per share) in our PBNA and Europe divisions, including $ 520 million related to the remeasurement of our 39 % ownership in TBG at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, discounted cash flo ws and an option pricing model related to our 24 Table of Contents liquidation preference in TBG . See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information. In the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 3.3 billion ($ 2.9 billion after-tax or $ 2.07 per share) in our PBNA and Europe divisions . In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023, we recognized i mpairment charges related to our TBG investment. See Note 9 for further information. Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.

(b) Recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Note 13 - Supply Chain Financing Arrangements As part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of June 17, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $ 1.8 billion and $ 1.7 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable are to suppliers participating in these financing arrangements. 25 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL REVIEW Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies and estimates below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2022 Form 10-K. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Income Taxes In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur. Our Business Risks This Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act 26 Table of Contents are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine; future demand for PepsiCo’s products; damage to PepsiCo’s reputation or brand image; product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety; PepsiCo’s ability to compete effectively; PepsiCo’s ability to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce or effectively manage changes in our workforce; water scarcity; changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer; disruption of PepsiCo’s manufacturing operations or supply chain, including continued increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs; political or social conditions in the markets where PepsiCo’s products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCo’s ability to grow its business in developing and emerging markets; changes in economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems; failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions; PepsiCo’s reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems; climate change or measures to address climate change; strikes or work stoppages; failure to realize benefits from PepsiCo’s productivity initiatives; deterioration in estimates and underlying assumptions regarding future performance that can result in an impairment charge; fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCo’s credit ratings; imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo’s products; imposition of limitations on the marketing or sale of PepsiCo’s products; changes in laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials; failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities; failure to adequately protect PepsiCo’s intellectual property rights or infringement on intellectual property rights of others; failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other risks and uncertainties including those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2022 Form 10-K and in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain During the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023 , we continued to experience significantly higher operating costs, including on transportation, labor and commodity (including energy) costs, which we expect to continue for the remainder of 2023. Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. A number of external factors, including the deadly conflict in Ukraine, the inflationary cost environment, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted 27 Table of Contents and may continue to impact transportation, labor and commodity availability costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices. Risks Associated with Climate Change Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. These new or increased legal or regulatory requirements, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could result in significant increased costs and additional investments in facilities and equipment. However, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations. Risks Associated with International Operations In the 12 weeks ended June 17, 2023, our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of March, April and May. In the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023, our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January through May. In the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023, our operations outside of the United States generated 40% of our consolidated net revenue, with Mexico, Canada, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk in the international markets in whi ch our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 2.5 percentage points primarily due to declines in the Egyptian pound, Turkish lira, South African rand, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan and Pakistani rupee, partially offset by an appreciation of the Mexican peso . Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, and natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely, including risks of additional impairments or write-offs, and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, including i mpairment charges. Also see Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for charges taken as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of June 17, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of these items. 28 Table of Contents Risks Associated with the Deadly Conflict in Ukraine In addition to the risks associated with international operations discussed above, we continue to face risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine. The conflict has continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, and certain of our operations in Ukraine remain suspended. We have suspended sales to our customers of Pepsi-Cola and certain of our other global beverage brands, our discretionary capital investments and advertising and promotional activities in Russia, which has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business. We continue to offer our other products in Russia. The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risks, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets and other corporate banking services, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets or additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees, customers, operations or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K, for a discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, including i mpairment charges. Also see Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for charges taken as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022. The extent of the impact of these tragic events on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the conflic t, regional instability and ongoing and additional financial and economic sanctions, export controls and other legislation imposed by governments. We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve and to identify actions to potentially m itigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. We sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations 29 Table of Contents and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. OECD Global Minimum Tax Numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) model rules that propose a global minimum tax rate of 15% and European Union member states have agreed to implement the global minimum tax. Certain countries, including European Union member states, have enacted or are expected to enact legislation to be effective as early as 2024, with widespread implementation of a global minimum tax expected by 2025. As the legislation becomes effective in countries in which we do business, our taxes could increase and negatively impact our provision for income taxes. We will continue to monitor pending legislation and implementation by individual countries and evaluate the potential impact on our business in future periods. Retail Landscape Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the continued growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Cautionary statements included above and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” in our 2022 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. Results of Operations – Consolidated Review Consolidated Results Volume Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Financial Results – Volume” included in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information on volume. Unit volume growth adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures. Acquisitions and divestitures, when used in this report, reflect mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. Further, unit volume growth excludes the impact of an additional week of results every five or six years (53rd reporting week), where applicable, including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We report all of our international operations on a monthly calendar basis. The 12 weeks ended June 17, 2023 and June 11, 2022 include volume outside of North America for the months of March, April, and May. The 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023 and June 11, 2022 include volume outside of North America for the months of January through May. 30 Table of Contents Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Change 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Change Net revenue $ 22,322 $ 20,225 10 % $ 40,168 $ 36,425 10 % Operating profit $ 3,659 $ 2,077 76 % $ 6,288 $ 7,344 (14) % Operating margin 16.4 % 10.3 % 6.1 15.7 % 20.2 % (4.5) See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. 12 Weeks Operating profit grew 76% and operating margin improved 6.1 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by effective net pricing, a 65-percentage-point favorable impact of the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict compared to the prior year, productivity savings and a 12-percentage-point favorable impact of the brand portfolio impairment charges compared to the prior year. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 22-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, higher advertising and marketing expenses, a decrease in organic vol ume, a 6-percentage-point impact of the impairment charges related to our TBG investment an d a 5-percentage-point impact of lower mark-to-market gains on commodity derivatives. The operating margin improvement primarily reflects the favorable impact of the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the brand portfolio impairment charges compared to the prior year. 24 Weeks Operating profit decreased 14% and operating margin declined 4.5 percentage points. Operating profit performance was primarily driven by a 51-percentage-point unfavorable impact of the prior-year gain associated with the Juice Transaction, certain operating cost increases, a 26-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, a decrease in organic volume, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 4-percentage-point impact of higher mark-to-market losses on commodity derivatives. These impacts were partially offset by effective net pricing, a 22-percentage-point favorable impact of the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict compared to the prior year, productivity savings and a 7-percentage-point favorable impact of the brand portfolio impairment charges compared to the prior year. The operating margin decline primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of the prior-year gain associated with the Juice Transaction, partially offset by the favorable impact of the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the brand portfolio impairment charges compared to the prior year. 31 Table of Contents Other Consolidated Results 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Change 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Change Other pension and retiree medical benefits income/(expense) $ 60 $ (2) $ 62 $ 121 $ 132 $ (11) Net interest expense and other $ (201) $ (236) $ 35 $ (401) $ (476) $ 75 Tax rate 21.3 % 21.4 % 21.5 % 18.3 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo (a) $ 2,748 $ 1,429 92 % $ 4,680 $ 5,690 (18) % Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted (a) $ 1.99 $ 1.03 93 % $ 3.38 $ 4.09 (17) % (a) For the 12 weeks ended June 11, 2022, the impairment of intangible assets as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict negatively impacted both net income attributable to PepsiCo performance and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share performance. For the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, the gain associated with the Juice Transaction contributed to both net income attributable to PepsiCo growth and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share growth, partially offset by the impairment of intangible assets as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. See Notes 4 and 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 12 Weeks Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $62 million, primarily reflecting a prior-year settlement charge of $131 million. In addition, the increase in other pension and retiree medical benefits income reflects lower amortization of net losses on pension obligations and higher rate on expected return on plan assets, partially offset by higher interest cost and recognition of fixed income losses on plan assets, all driven primarily by higher interest rates. Net interest expense and other decreased $35 million, primarily due to higher interest rates on average cash balances and gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability, partially offset by higher interest rates on debt, higher average debt balances and lower average cash balances. The reported tax rate decreased 0.1 percentage points, primarily as a result of the impact of current and prior-year impairments. 24 Weeks Other pension and retiree medical benefits income decreased $11 million, primarily due to higher interest cost and recognition of fixed income losses on plan assets, partially offset by lower amortization of net losses on pension obligations and higher rate on expected return on plan assets, all driven primarily by higher interest rates. The decrease in other pension and retiree medical benefits income was further offset by a prior-year settlement charge of $131 million. Net interest expense and other decreased $75 million, primarily due to higher interest rates on average cash balances and gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability, partially offset by higher interest rates on debt, higher average debt balances and lower average cash balances. The reported tax rate increased 3.2 percentage points, primarily reflecting the prior-year impact of the Juice Transaction. Results of Operations – Division Review While our financial results in North America are reported on a 12-week basis, all of our international operations are reported on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of March, April, and May are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended June 17, 2023 and June 11, 2022, and the months January through May are reflected in our results for the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023 and June 11, 2022. 32 Table of Contents In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries. See “Our Business Risks,” “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with GAAP.

In certain instances, the impact of organic volume on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume change disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between bottler case sales and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE). We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue. Operating Profit, Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis Operating profit adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit growth adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures.

Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides 40 Table of Contents additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q are discussed below: Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, gain associated with the Juice Transaction, impairment of intangible assets, other pension and retiree medical benefits income/(expense), provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Productivity Plan, charges associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, the gain associated with the Juice Transaction, impairment and other charges/credits comprised of Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges, and the impact of settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and where applicable, the impact of the 53 rd reporting week, including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful 41 Table of Contents information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. 42 Table of Contents Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-Q are impacted by the following items in each of the following periods: 12 Weeks Ended 6/17/2023 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 10,121 $ 12,201 $ 8,542 $ 3,659 $ 747 $ 2,748 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 1 (1) 8 (9) (2) (7) Restructuring and impairment charges (3) 3 (89) 92 29 63 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (7) 7 1 6 Impairment and other charges/credits 1 (1) (111) 110 28 82 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 10,120 $ 12,202 $ 8,343 $ 3,859 $ 803 $ 2,892 12 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Gain associated with the Juice Transaction Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 9,415 $ 10,810 $ 7,387 $ (13) $ 1,359 $ 2,077 $ (2) $ 393 $ 17 $ 1,429 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 22 (22) 76 — — (98) — (25) — (73) Restructuring and impairment charges — — (45) — — 45 3 8 1 39 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (8) — — 8 — 1 — 7 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction — — — 13 — (13) — (3) — (10) Impairment and other charges/credits (1) 1 (29) — (1,359) 1,389 — 299 — 1,090 Pension and retiree medical-related impact — — — — — — 131 30 — 101 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 9,436 $ 10,789 $ 7,381 $ — $ — $ 3,408 $ 132 $ 703 $ 18 $ 2,583 24 Weeks Ended 6/17/2023 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 18,109 $ 22,059 $ 15,771 $ 6,288 $ 121 $ 1,293 $ 35 $ 4,680 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (13) 13 (49) 62 — 15 — 47 Restructuring and impairment charges (6) 6 (199) 205 (1) 43 1 160 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (9) 9 — 2 — 7 Impairment and other charges/credits 5 (5) (102) 97 — 28 — 69 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 18,095 $ 22,073 $ 15,412 $ 6,661 $ 120 $ 1,381 $ 36 $ 4,963 43 Table of Contents 24 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Gain associated with the Juice Transaction Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 16,848 $ 19,577 $ 13,967 $ (3,335) $ 1,601 $ 7,344 $ 132 $ 1,281 $ 29 $ 5,690 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 55 (55) 155 — — (210) — (51) — (159) Restructuring and impairment charges (5) 5 (67) — — 72 3 14 1 60 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (58) — — 58 6 10 — 54 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction — — — 3,335 — (3,335) — (455) — (2,880) Impairment and other charges/credits (141) 141 (129) — (1,601) 1,871 — 347 — 1,524 Pension and retiree medical-related impact — — — — — — 115 26 — 89 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 16,757 $ 19,668 $ 13,868 $ — $ — $ 5,800 $ 256 $ 1,172 $ 30 $ 4,378 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Change 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Change Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, GAAP measure $ 1.99 $ 1.03 93 % $ 3.38 $ 4.09 (17) % Mark-to-market net impact — (0.05) 0.03 (0.11) Restructuring and impairment charges 0.05 0.03 0.12 0.04 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — 0.01 — 0.04 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction — (0.01) — (2.07) Impairment and other charges/credits 0.06 0.79 0.05 1.10 Pension and retiree medical-related impact — 0.07 — 0.06 Core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, non-GAAP measure $ 2.09 (a) $ 1.86 (a) 12 % $ 3.59 (a) $ 3.15 14 % Impact of foreign exchange translation 2 2 Growth in core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP measure 15 % (a) 16 % (a) Does not sum due to rounding. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. 44 Table of Contents Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. Plan to date through June 17, 2023, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.7 billion, including cash expenditures of $1.2 billion. For the remainder of 2023, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $325 million, and cash expenditures of approximately $350 million. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures through 2025, with the balance to be incurred through 2028. Charges include severance and other employee costs, asset impairments and other costs. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K, for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Gain Associated with the Juice Transaction We recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PBNA and Europe divisions. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Impairment and Other Charges/Credits We recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below. Russia-Ukraine Conflict Charges In connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs. We also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in 2022. See Notes 1 and 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges We recognized intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment and other charges as a result of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands. We also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in 2022. See Notes 1 and 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 45 Table of Contents Other Impairment Charges We recognized impairment charges related to our investment in TBG. See Notes 1 and 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest cost, partially offset by curtailment gains resulting from the Juice Transaction. See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See “Our Business Risks” and Notes 8 and 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the conflict. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the Russia-Ukraine conflict may have on our business and financial results. See “Our Business Risks,” Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information related to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business and financial results. As of June 17, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of June 17, 2023, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.3 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. See “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion of the TCJ Act. Supply chain financing arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. See Note 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of supply chain financing arrangements. 46 Table of Contents Operating Activities During the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.0 billion, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1.9 billion in the prior-year period. The increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects favorable operating profit performance, partially offset by unfavorable working capital comparisons and higher net cash tax payments in the current year. Investing Activities During the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023 , net cash used for investing activities was $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $1.4 billion. We regularly review our plans with respect to ne t capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs. Financing Activities During the 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $0.7 billion, primarily reflecting net proceeds of short-term borrowings of $3.7 billion and proceeds from the issuances of long-term debt of $3.0 billion, partially offset by the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $3.7 billion and payments of long-term debt of $2.3 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 10, 2022, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on February 11, 2022 and will expire on February 28, 2026. In addition, on February 9, 2023, we announced a 10% increase in our annualized dividend to $5.06 per share from $4.60 per share, effective with the dividend paid in June 2023. We expect to return a total of approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2023, comprising dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.0 billion. Free Cash Flow The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow, see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 24 Weeks Ended 6/17/2023 6/11/2022 Net cash provided by operating activities, GAAP measure $ 2,019 $ 1,881 Capital spending (1,513) (1,499) Sales of property, plant and equipment 122 222 Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ 628 $ 604 We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2022 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. 47 Table of Contents Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information. Material Changes in Line Items in Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated statement of income are discussed in “Results of Operations – Consolidated Review,” “Results of Operations – Division Review” and “Items Affecting Comparability.” Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows are discussed in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated balance sheet are discussed below: Total Assets As of June 17, 2023, total assets were $95.9 billion, compared to $92.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in total assets is primarily driven by the following line items: Change (a) Reference Cash and cash equivalents $ 1.2 Statement of Cash Flows Accounts and notes receivable, less allowance $ 1.3 (b) Inventories $ 0.7 (c) Total Liabilities As of June 17, 2023, total liabilities were $78.1 billion, compared to $74.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in total liabilities is primarily driven by the following line items: Change (a) Reference Short-term debt obligations $ 4.2 (d) Accounts payable and other current liabilities $ (1.4) (e) (a) In billions. (b) Primarily reflects favorable operating performance. (c) Primarily reflects seasonal build of inventory. (d) Primarily reflects issuances of commercial paper. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. (e) Primarily reflects payments of production and capital expenditure payables across our divisions. Total Equity See our condensed consolidated statement of equity and Notes 9 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 48 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 17, 2023, the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, and Equity for the twelve and twenty-four weeks ended June 17, 2023 and June 11, 2022, the related Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the twenty-four weeks ended June 17, 2023 and June 11, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the fiscal year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 8, 2023, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York July 12, 2023 49 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the 12 weeks ended June 17, 2023, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses in phases over the next several years. In connection with these ERP implementations, we are updating and will continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. During the 12 weeks ended June 17, 2023, we continued implementing these systems, resulting in changes that materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with this multi-year productivity plan and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These business process changes have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Except with respect to the continued implementation of ERP systems, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the 12 weeks ended June 17, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting as we continue to implement our ERP solution and our 2019 multi-year productivity plan. 50 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. The following information should be read in conjunction with the discussion set forth under Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our 2022 Form 10-K. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See also “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2022 Form 10-K. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K). This report should be read in conjunction with our 2022 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. While our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, all of our international operations are reported on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of January and February are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 and March 19, 2022. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates. Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. Our Divisions We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada; 8 Table of Contents 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada; 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe; 6) Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region. Net revenue of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/25/2023 3/19/2022 FLNA $ 5,583 $ 4,839 QFNA 777 713 PBNA 5,798 5,353 LatAm 1,777 1,474 Europe 1,886 1,797 AMESA 1,019 1,004 APAC 1,006 1,020 Total $ 17,846 $ 16,200 Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products to our customers. The following tables reflect the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our convenient food business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue: 12 Weeks Ended 3/25/2023 3/19/2022 Beverages (a) Convenient Foods Beverages (a) Convenient Foods LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 45 % 55 % 50 % 50 % AMESA 30 % 70 % 30 % 70 % APAC 15 % 85 % 15 % 85 % PepsiCo 40 % 60 % 40 % 60 % (a) Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe divisions, is approximately 35 % of our consolidated net revenue in each of the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 and March 19, 2022. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue but lower operating margin as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. 9 Table of Contents Operating profit of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/25/2023 3/19/2022 FLNA $ 1,599 $ 1,296 QFNA 188 159 PBNA (a) 483 3,434 LatAm 364 323 Europe (a) (b) 71 ( 136 ) AMESA 168 180 APAC 227 215 Total divisions 3,100 5,471 Corporate unallocated expenses ( 471 ) ( 204 ) Total $ 2,629 $ 5,267 (a) In the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we recorded a gain of $ 3,024 million and $ 298 million in our PBNA and Europe divisions, respectively, associated with the Juice Transaction. The total after-tax amount was $ 2,870 million or $ 2.06 per share. See Note 12 for further information. (b) In the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we recognized impairment and other charges/credits as follows: (1) Pre-tax charges of $ 241 million ($ 241 million after-tax or $ 0.17 per share), as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including impairment related to property, plant and equipment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write downs and other charges, with $ 140 million recorded in cost of sales, $ 100 million recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and $ 1 million recorded in impairment of intangible assets. (2) Pre-tax brand portfolio impairment charges of $ 241 million ($ 193 million after-tax or $ 0.14 per share) in impairment of intangible assets related to the repositioning or discontinuation of certain juice and dairy brands in Russia. See Note 4 for further information. For information on indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K. Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs to allow financial statement users to understand the effect on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The new guidance requires disclosure of key terms of the program, including a description of the payment terms, payment timing and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided to the finance provider or intermediary. Other requirements include the disclosure of the amount that remains unpaid as of the end of the reporting period, a description of where these obligations are presented in the balance sheet and a rollforward of the obligation during the annual period. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward, which is effective in fiscal year 2024 with early adoption permitted. We currently plan to adopt the rollforward guidance when effective. See Note 13 for disclosures currently required under this guidance. 10 Table of Contents Note 3 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $ 2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 10 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 35 % for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. The total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 15 % 1 % 25 % 10 % 25 % 5 % 4 % 15 % A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/25/2023 3/19/2022 Cost of sales $ 3 $ 5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 110 22 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income (a) ( 1 ) — Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 112 $ 27 After-tax amount $ 98 $ 21 Impact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ ( 0.07 ) $ ( 0.02 ) 12 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 3/25/2023 3/19/2022 through 3/25/2023 FLNA $ 7 $ 3 $ 217 QFNA — — 19 PBNA 5 3 231 LatAm 5 6 176 Europe 89 7 432 AMESA 5 2 87 APAC 1 1 78 Corporate 1 5 230 113 27 1,470 Other pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense (a) ( 1 ) — 97 Total $ 112 $ 27 $ 1,567 (a) Income amount represents adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts. 11 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 3/25/2023 3/19/2022 through 3/25/2023 Severance and other employee costs $ 92 $ 11 $ 899 Asset impairments — — 190 Other costs 20 16 478 Total $ 112 $ 27 $ 1,567 Severance and other employee costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits, as well as voluntary separation arrangements. Other costs primarily include costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including contract termination costs, consulting and other professional fees. A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan activity for the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 is as follows: Severance and Other Employee Costs Other Costs Total Liability as of December 31, 2022 $ 188 $ 8 $ 196 2023 restructuring charges 92 20 112 Cash payments ( 44 ) ( 20 ) ( 64 ) Non-cash charges and translation ( 4 ) — ( 4 ) Liability as of March 25, 2023 $ 232 $ 8 $ 240 Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at March 25, 2023 is expected to be paid by the end of 2023. Other Productivity Initiatives There were no charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives described above. See Notes 1 and 4 for impairment and other charges/credits taken related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and brand portfolio impairment charges. Note 4 - Intangible Assets During the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we repositioned or discontinued certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. As a result, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges (included in brand portfolio impairment charges) of $ 241 million ($ 193 million after-tax or $ 0.14 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to indefinite-lived intangible assets. See Note 1 for further information. For further information on indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K. 12 Table of Contents A summary of our amortizable intangible assets is as follows: 3/25/2023 12/31/2022 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Acquired franchise rights $ 833 $ ( 202 ) $ 631 $ 837 $ ( 200 ) $ 637 Customer relationships 563 ( 240 ) 323 571 ( 237 ) 334 Brands 1,085 ( 969 ) 116 1,097 ( 973 ) 124 Other identifiable intangibles 445 ( 265 ) 180 447 ( 265 ) 182 Total $ 2,926 $ ( 1,676 ) $ 1,250 $ 2,952 $ ( 1,675 ) $ 1,277 13 Table of Contents The change in the book value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is as follows: Balance 12/31/2022 Translation and Other Balance 3/25/2023 FLNA Goodwill $ 451 $ ( 2 ) $ 449 Brands 251 — 251 Total 702 ( 2 ) 700 QFNA Goodwill 189 — 189 Total 189 — 189 PBNA Goodwill 11,947 ( 7 ) 11,940 Reacquired franchise rights 7,061 ( 12 ) 7,049 Acquired franchise rights 1,758 ( 2 ) 1,756 Brands 2,508 1 2,509 Total 23,274 ( 20 ) 23,254 LatAm Goodwill 436 7 443 Brands 75 2 77 Total 511 9 520 Europe Goodwill 3,646 ( 56 ) 3,590 Reacquired franchise rights 421 ( 8 ) 413 Acquired franchise rights 148 ( 1 ) 147 Brands 1,664 ( 1 ) 1,663 Total 5,879 ( 66 ) 5,813 AMESA Goodwill 1,015 ( 52 ) 963 Brands 156 ( 13 ) 143 Total 1,171 ( 65 ) 1,106 APAC Goodwill 518 ( 3 ) 515 Brands 267 ( 2 ) 265 Total 785 ( 5 ) 780 Total goodwill 18,202 ( 113 ) 18,089 Total reacquired franchise rights 7,482 ( 20 ) 7,462 Total acquired franchise rights 1,906 ( 3 ) 1,903 Total brands 4,921 ( 13 ) 4,908 Total $ 32,511 $ ( 149 ) $ 32,362 14 Table of Contents Note 5 - Income Taxes In 2021, we received a final assessment from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016. The assessment included both agreed and unagreed issues. On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals conference. In 2022 , we came to an agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. As a result, we adjusted our reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act). Tax years 2014 through 2019 remain under audit for other issues . See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information. There were no tax amounts recognized in the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 and March 19, 2022 from this agreement.

Subsequent to March 25, 2023, we discharged via legal defeasance $ 94 million outstanding principal amount of certain notes originally issued by our subsidiary, The Quaker Oats Company, following the deposit of $ 102 million of U.S. government securities with the Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, in the fourth quarter of 2022. As of March 25, 2023, we had $ 800 million of commercial paper outstanding, excluding discounts. 16 Table of Contents Note 9 - Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. There have been no material changes during the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 with respect to our risk management policies or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of March 25, 2023 was $ 228 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of March 25, 2023. The notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of March 25, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows: Notional Amounts (a) 3/25/2023 12/31/2022 Commodity $ 1.8 $ 1.8 Foreign exchange $ 2.8 $ 3.0 Interest rate $ 1.3 $ 1.3 Net investment (b) $ 2.9 $ 2.9 (a) In billions. (b) The total notional of our net investment hedge consists of non-derivative debt instruments. As of March 25, 2023, approximately 4 % of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to 1 % as of December 31, 2022. Debt Securities Available-for-Sale Investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities impact earnings only when such securities are sold, or an allowance for expected credit losses or impairment is recognized. We regularly evaluate our investment portfolio for expected credit losses and impairment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the extent to which the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost; the financial condition of the issuer, including the credit quality, and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a debt security has a credit loss or is impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular debt security. There were no unrealized gains and losses on our investments as of March 25, 2023. There were no impairment charges related to our investments for the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023. 17 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of March 25, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are categorized as follows: 3/25/2023 12/31/2022 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Available-for-sale debt securities (b) 2 $ 658 $ — $ 660 $ — Index funds (c) 1 $ 250 $ — $ 257 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (d) 2 $ 14 $ — $ 14 $ — Deferred compensation (e) 2 $ — $ 432 $ — $ 434 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (f) 2 $ 23 $ 34 $ 24 $ 22 Interest rate (f) 2 — 175 — 164 Commodity (g) 2 2 50 2 60 $ 25 $ 259 $ 26 $ 246 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (f) 2 $ 17 $ 17 $ 21 $ 21 Commodity (g) 2 9 45 11 51 $ 26 $ 62 $ 32 $ 72 Total derivatives at fair value (h) $ 51 $ 321 $ 58 $ 318 Total $ 973 $ 753 $ 989 $ 752 (a) Fair value hierarchy levels are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) in both years. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities. (b) Primarily related to our investment in Celsius Holdings, Inc. convertible preferred stock. The fair value of our investment approximates the transaction price and any accrued dividends, as well as the amortized cost. As of March 25, 2023, $ 99 million and $ 559 million were classified as short-term investments and other assets, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, $ 3 million, $ 104 million and $ 553 million were classified as cash equivalents, short-term investments and other assets, respectively. (c) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (d) Based primarily on the price of our common stock. (e) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections. (f) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates. (g) Primarily based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements. (h) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on our balance sheet as of March 25, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of March 25, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 39 billion and $ 35 billion, respectively, based upon prices of identical or similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs. 18 Table of Contents Losses/(gains) on our cash flow and net investment hedges are categorized as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (a) 3/25/2023 3/19/2022 3/25/2023 3/19/2022 Foreign exchange $ 16 $ ( 8 ) $ 1 $ ( 4 ) Interest rate 11 ( 3 ) 3 20 Commodity 65 ( 189 ) 9 ( 78 ) Net investment 37 ( 51 ) — — Total $ 129 $ ( 251 ) $ 13 $ ( 62 ) (a) Foreign exchange derivative losses/(gains) are included in net revenue and cost of sales.

In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBG’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. We have significant influence over our investment in TBG and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of TBG’s earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). As a result of this transaction, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 3.3 billion ($ 2.9 billion after-tax or $ 2.08 per share) in our PBNA and Europe divisions, including $ 520 million related to the remeasurement of our 39 % ownership in TBG at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, discounted cash flo ws and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in TBG . See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information. 21 Table of Contents In the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 3.3 billion ($ 2.9 billion after-tax or $ 2.06 per share) in our PBNA and Europe divisions . Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.

Note 13 - Supply Chain Financing Arrangements As part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of March 25, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $ 1.9 billion and $ 1.7 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable are to suppliers participating in these financing arrangements. Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL REVIEW Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. 22 Table of Contents Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies and estimates below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2022 Form 10-K. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Income Taxes In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur. Our Business Risks This Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited 23 Table of Contents to: the risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine; future demand for PepsiCo’s products; damage to PepsiCo’s reputation or brand image; product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety; PepsiCo’s ability to compete effectively; PepsiCo’s ability to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce or effectively manage changes in our workforce; water scarcity; changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer; disruption of PepsiCo’s manufacturing operations or supply chain, including continued increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs; political or social conditions in the markets where PepsiCo’s products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCo’s ability to grow its business in developing and emerging markets; changes in economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems; failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions; PepsiCo’s reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems; climate change or measures to address climate change; strikes or work stoppages; failure to realize benefits from PepsiCo’s productivity initiatives; deterioration in estimates and underlying assumptions regarding future performance that can result in an impairment charge; fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCo’s credit ratings; imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo’s products; imposition of limitations on the marketing or sale of PepsiCo’s products; changes in laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials; failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities; failure to adequately protect PepsiCo’s intellectual property rights or infringement on intellectual property rights of others; failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; and potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other risks and uncertainties including those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2022 Form 10-K and in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain During the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 , we continued to experience significantly higher operating costs, including on transportation, labor and commodity (including energy) costs, which we expect to continue for the remainder of 2023. Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. A number of external factors, including the deadly conflict in Ukraine, the inflationary cost environment, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation, labor and commodity availability costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices. 24 Table of Contents Risks Associated with Climate Change Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. These new or increased legal or regulatory requirements, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could result in significant increased costs and additional investments in facilities and equipment. However, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations. Risks Associated with International Operations In the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023, our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January and February. In the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023, our operations outside of the United States generated 36% of our consolidated net revenue, with Mexico, Canada, China, Russia, the United Kingdom and Brazil comprising approximately 20% of our consolidated net revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk in the international markets in whi ch our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 2.5 percentage points primarily due to declines in the Egyptian pound, Turkish lira, Canadian dollar and Chinese yuan, partially offset by an appreciation of the Mexican peso . Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, and natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely, including risks of additional impairments or write-offs, and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, including i mpairment charges. Also see Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for charges taken as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of March 25, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of these items. Risks Associated with the Deadly Conflict in Ukraine In addition to the risks associated with international operations discussed above, we continue to face risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine. The conflict has continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, and certain of our operations in Ukraine remain suspended. We have suspended sales to our customers of Pepsi-Cola and certain of our other global beverage brands, our discretionary capital investments and advertising and promotional activities in Russia, which has 25 Table of Contents negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business. We continue to offer our other products in Russia. The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risks, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets and other corporate banking services, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets or additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees, customers, operations or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K, for a discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, including i mpairment charges. Also see Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for charges taken as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022. The extent of the impact of these tragic events on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the conflic t, regional instability and ongoing and additional financial and economic sanctions, export controls and other legislation imposed by governments. We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve and to identify actions to potentially m itigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. We sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. 26 Table of Contents OECD Global Minimum Tax Numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) model rules that propose a global minimum tax rate of 15% and European Union member states have agreed to implement the global minimum tax. Certain countries, including European Union member states, are expected to enact legislation to be effective as early as 2024, with widespread implementation of a global minimum tax expected by 2025. As the legislation becomes effective in countries in which we do business, our taxes could increase and negatively impact our provision for income taxes. We will continue to monitor pending legislation and implementation by individual countries and evaluate the potential impact on our business in future periods. Retail Landscape Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the continued growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Cautionary statements included above and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” in our 2022 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. Results of Operations – Consolidated Review Consolidated Results Volume Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Financial Results – Volume” included in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information on volume. Unit volume growth adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures. Acquisitions and divestitures, when used in this report, reflect mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. Further, unit volume growth excludes the impact of an additional week of results every five or six years (53rd reporting week), where applicable, including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We report all of our international operations on a monthly calendar basis. The 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 and March 19, 2022 include volume outside of North America for the months of January and February. 27 Table of Contents Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit 12 Weeks Ended 3/25/2023 3/19/2022 Change Net revenue $ 17,846 $ 16,200 10 % Operating profit $ 2,629 $ 5,267 (50) % Operating margin 14.7 % 32.5 % (17.8) See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. Operating profit decreased 50% and operating margin decreased 17.8 percentage points. Operating profit performance was primarily driven by a 73-percentage-point unfavorable impact of the gain associated with the Juice Transaction in the prior year, certain operating cost increases, a 33-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, a decrease in organic volume and a 4-percentage-point impact of higher mark-to-market losses on commodity derivatives. These impacts were partially offset by effective net pricing, productivity savings, and a 5-percentage-point impact each of the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the impairment of intangible assets related to the repositioning or discontinuation of certain juice and dairy brands in Russia. The operating margin decline primarily reflects the gain associated with the Juice Transaction in the prior year. Other Consolidated Results 12 Weeks Ended 3/25/2023 3/19/2022 Change Other pension and retiree medical benefits income $ 61 $ 134 $ (73) Net interest expense and other $ (200) $ (240) $ 40 Tax rate 21.9 % 17.2 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo (a) $ 1,932 $ 4,261 (55) % Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted (a) $ 1.40 $ 3.06 (54) % (a) For the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, the gain associated with the Juice Transaction contributed to both net income attributable to PepsiCo and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Other pension and retiree medical benefits income decreased $73 million, primarily due to higher interest cost and recognition of fixed income losses on plan assets, partially offset by lower amortization of net losses on pension obligations and higher rate on expected return on plan assets, all driven primarily by higher interest rates. Net interest expense and other decreased $40 million, primarily due to higher interest rates on average cash balances and gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability, partially offset by higher interest rates on debt. The reported tax rate increased 4.7 percentage points, primarily reflecting the prior-year impact of the Juice Transaction. Results of Operations – Division Review While our financial results in North America are reported on a 12-week basis, all of our international operations are reported on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of January and February are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 and March 19, 2022. In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries. 28 Table of Contents See “Our Business Risks,” “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with GAAP. Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

(b) Excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In certain instances, the impact of organic volume on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume change disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between bottler case sales and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE). We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue. Operating Profit, Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis Operating profit adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit growth adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures.

Unit volume declined slightly, primarily driven by a high-single-digit decline in dips, a mid-single-digit decline in trademark Tostitos and a double-digit decline in our Sabra joint venture products, partially offset by double-digit growth in trademark Chester’s and Fritos. Operating profit increased 23%, primarily reflecting the effective net pricing and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives, a 15-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil, potatoes and ingredients, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. QFNA Net revenue grew 9%, primarily driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decrease in organic volume. 30 Table of Contents Unit volume declined 5%, primarily reflecting double-digit declines in oatmeal and rice/pasta sides. Operating profit grew 18%, primarily reflecting the effective net pricing and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 17-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily grains, higher advertising and marketing expenses and the decrease in organic volume. PBNA Net revenue increased 8%, primarily driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decrease in organic volume. The Juice Transaction reduced net revenue growth by 3 percentage points. Unit volume decreased 2%, driven by a 4% decrease in non-carbonated beverage (NCB) volume and a 1% decrease in carbonated soft drink volume. The NCB volume decrease primarily reflected a high-single-digit decrease in Gatorade sports drinks and mid-single-digit decreases in our overall water portfolio and our Lipton ready-to-drink tea portfolio, partially offset by a double-digit increase in our juice and juice drinks portfolio (adjusted for the impact of the Juice Transaction). Operating profit decreased 86%, primarily reflecting a 96-percentage-point impact of the prior-year gain of $3.0 billion associated with the Juice Transaction. Operating profit also decreased due to certain operating cost increases, including information technology costs, a 45-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, including energy, sweeteners and packaging materials, the decrease in organic volume, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, net unfavorable insurance adjustments and the loss in net revenue due to the Juice Transaction negatively impacted operating profit performance by 8 percentage points and 6 percentage points, respectively. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing and productivity savings. Certain costs associated with remediating a service disruption from a third-party payroll service provider in the prior year positively contributed 7 percentage points to operating profit performance. LatAm Net revenue increased 21%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and a 6-percentage-point impact of favorable foreign exchange. Convenient foods unit volume grew 1%, primarily reflecting mid-single-digit growth in Mexico and low-single-digit growth in Brazil. Beverage unit volume grew 5%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Brazil and Peru, high-single-digit growth in Mexico and Guatemala and mid-single-digit growth in Colombia, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Argentina. Additionally, Chile experienced mid-single-digit growth. Operating profit increased 13%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, an 18-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil and grains, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 3-percentage-point unfavorable impact of certain indirect tax credits in Brazil compared to the prior year. Favorable foreign exchange contributed 6 percentage points to operating profit growth. Europe Net revenue increased 5%, reflecting effective net pricing, partially offset by an organic volume decline, a 5-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and a 2-percentage-point unfavorable impact of the Juice Transaction. 31 Table of Contents Convenient foods unit volume declined 5%, primarily reflecting a double-digit decline in Ukraine and high-single-digit declines in Russia and the United Kingdom, partially offset by high-single-digit growth in France and slight growth in Turkey. Additionally, the Netherlands declined slightly. Beverage unit volume declined 11%, primarily reflecting double-digit declines in Russia, Germany and Ukraine, partially offset by low-single-digit growth in Turkey. Additionally, the United Kingdom and France experienced mid-single-digit declines. Operating profit improvement primarily reflects the favorable impact of prior-year charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and impairment of intangible assets related to the repositioning or discontinuation of certain juice and dairy brands in Russia (brand portfolio impairment charges), the effective net pricing, productivity savings and a 39-percentage-point favorable impact of higher payments to employees for a change in pension benefits in the prior year. These impacts were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the prior-year gain associated with the Juice Transaction and higher restructuring and impairment charges. Additionally, operating profit improvement was negatively impacted by certain operating cost increases, a 238-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil, sweeteners and ingredients, the organic volume decline and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit improvement by 11 percentage points. AMESA Net revenue increased 2%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing, partially offset by an organic volume decline. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 28 percentage points, primarily due to weakening of the Egyptian pound. Convenient foods unit volume declined 8%, primarily reflecting a double-digit decline in South Africa, partially offset by double-digit growth in the Middle East. Additionally, India and Pakistan each experienced a low-single-digit decline. Beverage unit volume grew 15%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in India, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Nigeria. Additionally, the Middle East experienced high-single-digit growth and Pakistan experienced double-digit growth. Operating profit decreased 6%, primarily reflecting a 77-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil and packaging materials, certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing, productivity savings and a 7-percentage-point favorable impact of adjustments to the charges recorded in the prior year related to the sale of a non-strategic brand. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 23 percentage points, primarily due to weakening of the Egyptian pound. APAC Net revenue decreased 1%, reflecting a 6-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by effective net pricing and organic volume growth. Convenient foods unit volume grew 4%, primarily reflecting high-single-digit growth in China, partially offset by a double-digit decline in Thailand and a mid-single-digit decline in Australia. Beverage unit volume grew 2%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Vietnam and low-single-digit growth in China, partially offset by a double-digit decline in the Philippines and a slight decline in Thailand. Operating profit increased 5.5%, primarily reflecting the effective net pricing and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by a 12-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily 32 Table of Contents cooking oil and potatoes, and certain operating cost increases. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced operating profit growth by 6 percentage points. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q are discussed below: Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, gain associated with the Juice Transaction, impairment of intangible assets, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Productivity Plan, charges associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, the gain associated with the Juice Transaction, impairment and other charges/credits comprised of Russia-Ukraine conflict charges and brand portfolio impairment charges, and the impact of settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or 33 Table of Contents divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and where applicable, the impact of the 53 rd reporting week, including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-Q are impacted by the following items in each of the following periods: 12 Weeks Ended 3/25/2023 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 7,988 $ 9,858 $ 7,229 $ 2,629 $ 61 $ 546 $ 12 $ 1,932 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (14) 14 (57) 71 — 17 — 54 Restructuring and impairment charges (3) 3 (110) 113 (1) 14 1 97 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (2) 2 — 1 — 1 Impairment and other charges/credits 4 (4) 9 (13) — — — (13) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 7,975 $ 9,871 $ 7,069 $ 2,802 $ 60 $ 578 $ 13 $ 2,071 34 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended 3/19/2022 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Gain associated with the Juice Transaction Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 7,433 $ 8,767 $ 6,580 $ (3,322) $ 242 $ 5,267 $ 134 $ 888 $ 4,261 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 33 (33) 79 — — (112) — (26) (86) Restructuring and impairment charges (5) 5 (22) — — 27 — 6 21 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (50) — — 50 6 9 47 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction — — — 3,322 — (3,322) — (452) (2,870) Impairment and other charges/credits (140) 140 (100) — (242) 482 — 48 434 Pension and retiree medical-related impact — — — — — — (16) (4) (12) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 7,321 $ 8,879 $ 6,487 $ — $ — $ 2,392 $ 124 $ 469 $ 1,795 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. 12 Weeks Ended 3/25/2023 3/19/2022 Change Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, GAAP measure $ 1.40 $ 3.06 (54) % Mark-to-market net impact 0.04 (0.06) Restructuring and impairment charges 0.07 0.02 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — 0.03 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction — (2.06) Impairment and other charges/credits (0.01) 0.31 Pension and retiree medical-related impact — (0.01) Core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, non-GAAP measure $ 1.50 $ 1.29 16 % Impact of foreign exchange translation 2 Growth in core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP measure 18 % Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural products and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the 35 Table of Contents end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. Plan to date through March 25, 2023, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.6 billion, including cash expenditures of $1.1 billion. For the remainder of 2023, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $475 million, and cash expenditures of approximately $500 million. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2023 through 2024 financial results, with the balance to be incurred through 2028. Charges include severance and other employee costs, asset impairments and other costs. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K, for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Gain Associated with the Juice Transaction We recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PBNA and Europe divisions. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Impairment and Other Charges/Credits We recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges and brand portfolio impairment charges as described below. Russia-Ukraine Conflict Charges In connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs. See Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges We recognized asset impairment charges as a result of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue certain brands. We also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in the prior year related to the sale of a non-strategic brand. See Notes 1 and 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact relates to curtailment gains resulting from the Juice Transaction. Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing 36 Table of Contents needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See “Our Business Risks” and Notes 8 and 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the conflict. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the Russia-Ukraine conflict may have on our business and financial results. See “Our Business Risks,” Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information related to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business and financial results. As of March 25, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of March 25, 2023, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.6 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. See “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion of the TCJ Act. Supply chain financing arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. See Note 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of supply chain financing arrangements. Operating Activities During the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023, net cash used for operating activities was $0.4 billion, compared to net cash used for operating activities of $0.2 billion in the prior-year period. The decrease in operating cash flow primarily reflects unfavorable working capital comparisons, partially offset by favorable operating profit performance in the current year. Investing Activities During the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 , net cash used for investing activities was $0.5 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $0.6 billion. We regularly review our plans with respect to ne t capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs. 37 Table of Contents Financing Activities During the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $0.8 billion, primarily reflecting proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $3.0 billion and net proceeds of short-term borrowings of $0.9 billion, partially offset by the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments of $1.6 billion and share repurchases of $0.2 billion and payments of long-term debt borrowings of $1.3 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 10, 2022, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on February 11, 2022 and will expire on February 28, 2026. In addition, on February 9, 2023, we announced a 10% increase in our annualized dividend to $5.06 per share from $4.60 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2023. We expect to return a total of approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2023, comprising dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.0 billion. Free Cash Flow The table below reconciles net cash used for operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow, see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 12 Weeks Ended 3/25/2023 3/19/2022 Net cash used for operating activities, GAAP measure $ (392) $ (174) Capital spending (581) (522) Sales of property, plant and equipment 19 3 Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ (954) $ (693) We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2022 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information. 38 Table of Contents Material Changes in Line Items in Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated statement of income are discussed in “Results of Operations – Consolidated Review,” “Results of Operations – Division Review” and “Items Affecting Comparability.” Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows are discussed in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated balance sheet are discussed below: Total Assets As of March 25, 2023, total assets were $93.0 billion, compared to $92.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. In the 12-weeks ended March 25, 2023, there were no material changes in these line items. Total Liabilities As of March 25, 2023 total liabilities were $75.9 billion, compared to $74.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in total liabilities is primarily driven by the following line items: Change (a) Reference Short-term debt obligations $ 0.9 (b) Accounts payable and other current liabilities $ (1.8) (c) Long-term debt obligations $ 1.8 (d) (a) In billions. (b) Primarily reflects issuances of commercial paper. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. (c) Primarily reflects payments of 2022 production and capital expenditure payables across a number of our divisions. (d) Primarily reflects issuances of long-term debt, partially offset by debt maturities. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Total Equity Refer to our condensed consolidated statement of equity and Notes 9 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 39 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of March 25, 2023, the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the twelve weeks ended March 25, 2023 and March 19, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the fiscal year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 8, 2023, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York April 24, 2023 40 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses in phases over the next several years. In connection with these ERP implementations, we are updating and will continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. During the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023, we continued implementing these systems, resulting in changes that materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with this multi-year productivity plan and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These business process changes have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Except with respect to the continued implementation of ERP systems, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting as we continue to implement our ERP solution and our 2019 multi-year productivity plan. 41 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.

See accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 8 Table of Contents Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 25, 2021 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021 (2021 Form 10-K). This report should be read in conjunction with our 2021 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. While our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis. This change did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. For our international operations, the months of June, July and August are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended September 3, 2022, and the months of January through August are reflected in our results for the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates. Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. 9 Table of Contents Our Divisions We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada; 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe; 6) Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region. Net revenue of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 FLNA $ 5,563 $ 4,653 $ 15,583 $ 13,441 QFNA 713 618 2,101 1,839 PBNA 6,635 6,402 18,108 17,632 LatAm 2,517 2,100 6,406 5,309 Europe 3,646 3,612 8,466 8,693 AMESA 1,726 1,665 4,426 4,150 APAC 1,171 1,139 3,306 3,162 Total $ 21,971 $ 20,189 $ 58,396 $ 54,226 10 Table of Contents Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products to our customers. The following tables reflect the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our convenient food business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue: 12 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 Beverages (a) Convenient Foods Beverages (a) Convenient Foods LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 55 % 45 % 55 % 45 % AMESA 35 % 65 % 35 % 65 % APAC 25 % 75 % 25 % 75 % PepsiCo 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % 36 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 Beverages (a) Convenient Foods Beverages (a) Convenient Foods LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 50 % 50 % 55 % 45 % AMESA 35 % 65 % 35 % 65 % APAC 25 % 75 % 25 % 75 % PepsiCo 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % (a) Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe divisions, is approximately 40 % of our consolidated net revenue in each of the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022 and September 4, 2021. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue but lower operating margin as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. Operating profit of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 FLNA $ 1,588 $ 1,357 $ 4,332 $ 3,979 QFNA 122 106 416 384 PBNA (a) (b) 784 773 4,869 1,948 LatAm (c) 463 393 1,206 967 Europe (a) (d) 564 439 ( 369 ) 975 AMESA 268 312 738 706 APAC 199 201 620 601 Total divisions 3,988 3,581 11,812 9,560 Corporate unallocated expenses (e) (f) ( 635 ) ( 422 ) ( 1,115 ) ( 960 ) Total $ 3,353 $ 3,159 $ 10,697 $ 8,600 (a) In the 12 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we recorded a charge of $ 8 million and $ 6 million in our PBNA and Europe divisions, respectively, associated with the Juice Transaction.

Note 2 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in 2021, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $ 2.4 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 10 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 35 % for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. The total expected plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 15 % 1 % 25 % 10 % 25 % 5 % 4 % 15 % A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 Cost of sales $ 1 $ 9 $ 6 $ 13 Selling, general and administrative expenses 50 42 117 110 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense — 1 3 6 Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 51 $ 52 $ 126 $ 129 After-tax amount $ 40 $ 45 $ 101 $ 109 Impact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ ( 0.03 ) $ ( 0.03 ) $ ( 0.07 ) $ ( 0.08 ) 13 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 through 9/3/2022 FLNA $ 4 $ 2 $ 10 $ 20 $ 174 QFNA 1 1 1 1 13 PBNA 4 3 9 8 167 LatAm 3 14 17 22 156 Europe 21 20 40 46 274 AMESA — 5 5 9 75 APAC 4 1 8 2 69 Corporate 14 5 33 15 172 51 51 123 123 1,100 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense — 1 3 6 70 Total $ 51 $ 52 $ 126 $ 129 $ 1,170 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 through 9/3/2022 Severance and other employee costs $ 10 $ 28 $ 41 $ 77 $ 605 Asset impairments 7 3 7 4 164 Other costs 34 21 78 48 401 Total $ 51 $ 52 $ 126 $ 129 $ 1,170 Severance and other employee costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits, as well as voluntary separation arrangements.

Other Productivity Initiatives There were no charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives described above. For information on other impairment charges, see Notes 1 and 3 for Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges and Russia-Ukraine Conflict Charges. 14 Table of Contents Note 3 - Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. In the second quarter of 2022, macroeconomic factors, sanctions and other regulations as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict indicated a material deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital. These factors required us to perform a quantitative assessment, despite the absence of a material adverse impact on these assets’ financial performance (e.g., sales, operating profit, cash flows). The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeds the fair value, with the decrease in the fair value primarily attributable to a significant increase in the weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the macroeconomic uncertainty in Russia. As a result of the quantitative assessment, in the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $ 1.2 billion ($ 958 million after-tax or $ 0.69 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, related to our juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. See Note 1 for further information. During the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we discontinued or repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. As a result, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges (Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges) of $ 241 million ($ 193 million after-tax or $ 0.14 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to indefinite-lived intangible assets. In light of the current political and economic environment, we will continue to review and analyze our brand portfolio worldwide. See Note 1 for further information. The annual impairment assessment on indefinite-lived intangible assets performed in the third quarter of 2022 resulted in no impairment. The estimated fair values of certain beverage businesses and brands in Europe exceeded their carrying values. However, there could be impairments of the carrying values of goodwill and brands associated with these businesses if future performance does not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. 15 Table of Contents For further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K.

The assessment included both agreed and unagreed issues. On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals conference. As a result of the analysis of the 2014 through 2016 final assessment, we remeasured all applicable reserves for uncertain tax positions for all years open under the statute of limitations, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax expense of $ 112 million in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021. There were no tax amounts recognized in the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022 from this assessment. In the 12 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we came to an agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. As a result, we reduced our reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax benefit of $ 198 million ($ 0.14 per share) in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022. Tax years 2014 through 2019 remain under audit for other issues. On August 16, 2022, the “Inflation Reduction Act” (H.R. 5376) was signed into law in the United States. We do not currently expect the Inflation Reduction Act to have a material impact on our financial results, including on our annual estimated effective tax rate or on our liquidity. Note 5 - Share-Based Compensation The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 Share-based compensation expense – equity awards $ 77 $ 71 $ 233 $ 215 Share-based compensation expense – liability awards 4 3 16 7 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — 3 — Restructuring charges — ( 1 ) — — Total $ 81 $ 73 $ 252 $ 222 The following table summarizes share-based awards granted under the terms of the PepsiCo, Inc.

All grant activity is disclosed at target. We granted long-term cash awards to certain executive officers and other senior executives with an aggregate target value of $ 18 million and $ 17 million during the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022 and September 4, 2021, respectively. For the 12 weeks ended September 3, 2022 and September 4, 2021, our grants of stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards were nominal. 18 Table of Contents Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: 36 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 Expected life 7 years 7 years Risk-free interest rate 1.8 % 1.1 % Expected volatility 16 % 14 % Expected dividend yield 2.5 % 3.1 % Note 6 - Pension and Retiree Medical Benefits In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we recognized pre-tax settlement charges of $ 59 million ($ 46 million after-tax or $ 0.03 per share) and $ 190 million ($ 147 million after-tax or $ 0.11 per share), respectively, primarily related to a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan due to lump sum distributions to retired or terminated employees. The settlement charge was triggered when the cumulative lump sum distributions exceeded the total annual servic e and interest cost in 2022. Related plan assets and benefit obligations were remeasured using remeasurement date assumptions. The weighted-average discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit plans’ projected benefit obligations increased from 2.9 % to 3.4 %. In addition, the U.S. defined benefit pension plans’ weighted-average interest cost discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to determine 2022 net periodic benefit cost/(income) increased from 2.4 % and 6.3 % to 3.1 % and 6.7 %, respectively. For further information on our policies for pension, retiree-medical and savings plans, refer to Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K. In the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we transferred pension and retiree medical obligations of $ 145 million and related assets to the Tropicana JV in connection with the Juice Transaction. See Note 11 for further information.

During the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022 and September 4, 2021, we made discretionary contributions of $ 150 million and $ 500 million, respectively, to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans, and $ 10 million and $ 25 million, respectively, to our international defined benefit plans. Note 7 - Debt Obligations In the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we issued the following senior notes: Interest Rate Maturity Date Principal Amount (a) 3.200 % July 2029 £ 300 (b) 3.550 % July 2034 £ 450 (b) 3.600 % February 2028 $ 750 3.900 % July 2032 $ 1,250 4.200 % July 2052 $ 500 (a) Excludes debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums. (b) These notes, issued in British pounds, were designated as net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, except for an amount equivalent to the net proceeds from our 3.900 % senior notes due 2032 that will be used to fund, in whole or in part, eligible green projects in the categories of investments in recycling and sustainable plastics and packaging, decarbonizing our operations and supply chain, water sustainability, and regenerative agriculture, which promote our selected Sustainable Development Goals, as defined by the United Nations. In the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, $ 1.7 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes matured and were paid . In addition, in the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we paid $ 750 million to redeem all $ 750 million outstanding principal amount of our 2.25 % senior notes due May 2022, and we paid $ 800 million to redeem all $ 800 million outstanding principal amount of our 3.10 % senior notes due July 2022. As of September 3, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding. 20 Table of Contents In the second quarter of 2022, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement), which expires on May 27, 2027. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.8 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $ 0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.75 billion five-year credit agreement, dated as of May 28, 2021. Also in the second quarter of 2022, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires on May 26, 2023. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.8 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of May 28, 2021. Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of September 3, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement. Note 8 - Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. There have been no material changes during the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022 with respect to our risk management policies or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K. We continue to evaluate our hedging strategies related to our Russian business based on the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on financial markets. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of September 3, 2022 was $ 501 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of September 3, 2022. 21 Table of Contents The notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of September 3, 2022 and December 25, 2021 are as follows: Notional Amounts (a) 9/3/2022 12/25/2021 Commodity $ 1.9 $ 1.6 Foreign exchange $ 2.8 $ 2.8 Interest rate $ 2.1 $ 2.1 Net investment (b) $ 2.7 $ 2.1 (a) In billions. (b) The total notional of our net investment hedge consists of non-derivative debt instruments. As of September 3, 2022, approximately 1 % of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to 2 % as of December 25, 2021. Debt Securities Held-to-Maturity Investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. As of September 3, 2022, we had no investments in debt securities. As of December 25, 2021, we had $ 130 million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. As of December 25, 2021, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material. Available-for-Sale Investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities impact net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. We regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular debt security. In the 12 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we entered into an agreement with Celsius to distribute Celsius energy drinks in the United States (see Note 3 for further information) and invested $ 550 million in Series A convertible preferred shares issued by Celsius, which included certain conversion and redemption features. The preferred shares automatically convert into Celsius common shares after six years if certain market-based conditions are met, or can be redeemed after seven years. Shares underlying the transaction were priced at $ 75 per share, and the preferred shares are entitled to a 5 % annual dividend. Given our redemption right, we classified our investment in the convertible preferred stock as an available-for-sale debt security. There were no unrealized gains and losses on our investment as of September 3, 2022. We recorded no other-than-temporary impairment charges on our investment for the 12 weeks ended September 3, 2022. 22 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of September 3, 2022 and December 25, 2021 are categorized as follows: 9/3/2022 12/25/2021 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Available-for-sale debt security (b) 2 $ 555 $ — $ — $ — Index funds (c) 1 $ 278 $ — $ 337 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (d) 2 $ 13 $ — $ 21 $ — Deferred compensation (e) 2 $ — $ 436 $ — $ 505 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (f) 2 $ 29 $ 14 $ 29 $ 14 Interest rate (f) 2 6 416 14 264 Commodity (g) 2 — 77 70 5 $ 35 $ 507 $ 113 $ 283 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (f) 2 $ 30 $ 9 $ 19 $ 7 Commodity (g) 2 64 27 35 22 $ 94 $ 36 $ 54 $ 29 Total derivatives at fair value (h) $ 129 $ 543 $ 167 $ 312 Total $ 975 $ 979 $ 525 $ 817 (a) Fair value hierarchy levels are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) in both years. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities. (b) Related to our investment in Celsius convertible preferred stock. The fair value of our investment approximates the transaction price and accrued dividends, as well as the amortized cost. (c) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (d) Based primarily on the price of our common stock. (e) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections. (f) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates. (g) Primarily based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements. (h) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of September 3, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were not material. There was no collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of September 3, 2022 and December 25, 2021 was $ 36 billion and $ 43 billion, respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs. 23 Table of Contents Losses/(gains) on our hedging instruments are categorized as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Fair Value/Non- designated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Income Statement (a) Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (b) 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 Foreign exchange $ ( 60 ) $ ( 5 ) $ ( 31 ) $ ( 18 ) $ 1 $ 27 Interest rate — 1 81 52 94 53 Commodity 53 ( 31 ) 141 11 ( 51 ) ( 66 ) Net investment — — ( 144 ) ( 63 ) — — Total $ ( 7 ) $ ( 35 ) $ 47 $ ( 18 ) $ 44 $ 14 36 Weeks Ended Fair Value/Non- designated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Income Statement (a) Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (b) 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 Foreign exchange $ ( 55 ) $ 5 $ ( 13 ) $ 20 $ ( 20 ) $ 67 Interest rate — 2 160 ( 12 ) 175 2 Commodity ( 294 ) ( 182 ) ( 49 ) ( 235 ) ( 203 ) ( 109 ) Net investment — — ( 283 ) ( 71 ) — — Total $ ( 349 ) $ ( 175 ) $ ( 185 ) $ ( 298 ) $ ( 48 ) $ ( 40 ) (a) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

(Pioneer Foods), Rockstar Energy Beverages (Rockstar) and Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. (Be & Cheery). The purchase price allocations for each of these acquisitions were finalized in the second quarter of 2021. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information. Juice Transaction In the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for approximately $ 3.5 billion in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, and a 39 % noncontrolling interest in the Tropicana JV, operating across North America and Europe. The North America portion of the transaction was completed on January 24, 2022 and the Europe portion of the transaction was completed on February 1, 2022. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for Tropicana JV’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. We have significant influence over our investment in the Tropicana JV and account 28 Table of Contents for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of Tropicana JV’s earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). As a result of this transaction, in the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 3.3 billion ($ 2.9 billion after-tax or $ 2.07 per share) in our PBNA and Europe divisions, including $ 525 million related to the remeasurement of our 39 % ownership in the Tropicana JV at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, discounted cash flo ws and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in the Tro picana JV. In the 12 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we recorded certain purchase price adjustments for net working capital and net debt amounts, which reduced the transaction price and resulted in the recognition of pre-tax expense of $ 14 million ($ 11 million after-tax or $ 0.01 per share) in our PBNA and Europe divisions. I n the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect to finalize the purchase price adjustments for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement. A summary of income statement activity related to the Juice Transaction in the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022 is as follows: PBNA Europe Corporate Total PepsiCo Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Impact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share Gain associated with the Juice Transaction $ ( 3,029 ) $ ( 292 ) $ — $ ( 3,321 ) $ 452 $ ( 2,869 ) $ 2.07 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges 42 13 6 61 ( 10 ) 51 ( 0.04 ) Operating profit $ ( 2,987 ) $ ( 279 ) $ 6 ( 3,260 ) 442 ( 2,818 ) 2.03 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income (b) ( 10 ) 3 ( 7 ) 0.01 Total Juice Transaction $ ( 3,270 ) $ 445 $ ( 2,825 ) $ 2.03 (c) (a) Includes $ 194 million of deferred tax expense related to the recognition of our investment in the Tropicana JV. (b) Includes $ 16 million curtailment gain, partially offset by $ 6 million special termination benefits. (c) Does not sum due to rounding. In connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement with PAI Partners, under which we provide certain services to the Tropicana JV to help facilitate an orderly transition of the business following the sale. In return for these services, the Tropicana JV is required to pay certain agreed upon fees to reimburse us for our costs without markup. Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Merger and integration charges include changes in fair value of contingent consideration, liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, employee-related costs, contract termination costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees. 29 Table of Contents A summary of our acquisition and divestiture-related charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 Transaction FLNA $ — $ — $ — $ 2 BFY Brands, Inc.

Note 12 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs to allow financial statement users to understand the effect on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The new guidance requires disclosure of key terms of the program, including a description of the payment terms, payment timing and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided to the finance provider or intermediary. Other requirements include the disclosure of the amount that remains unpaid as of the end of the reporting period, a description of where these obligations are presented in the balance sheet and a rollforward of the obligation during the annual period. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward, which is effective in 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption for this guidance. Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL REVIEW Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. 30 Table of Contents Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies and estimates below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2021 Form 10-K. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Income Taxes In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur. Our Business Risks This Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited 31 Table of Contents to: the risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine; the impact of COVID-19; future demand for PepsiCo’s products; damage to PepsiCo’s reputation or brand image; product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety; PepsiCo’s ability to compete effectively; PepsiCo’s ability to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce; water scarcity; changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer; disruption of PepsiCo’s manufacturing operations or supply chain, including increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs; political or social conditions in the markets where PepsiCo’s products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCo’s ability to grow its business in developing and emerging markets; changes in economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems; failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions; PepsiCo’s reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems; climate change or measures to address climate change; strikes or work stoppages; failure to realize benefits from PepsiCo’s productivity initiatives; deterioration in estimates and underlying assumptions regarding future performance that can result in an impairment charge; fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCo’s credit ratings; imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo’s products; imposition of limitations on the marketing or sale of PepsiCo’s products; changes in laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials; failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities; failure to adequately protect PepsiCo’s intellectual property rights or infringement on intellectual property rights of others; failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; and potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other risks and uncertainties including those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2021 Form 10-K and in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. COVID-19 Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous measures have been implemented around the world to try to reduce the spread of the virus and these measures have impacted and will continue to impact us, our business partners and our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic, including these measures, may continue to result in changes in demand for our products, increases in employee and other operating costs or supply chain disruptions, any of which can impact our ability to operate our business. In addition, we may continue to experience business disruptions resulting from the temporary closures of our facilities or facilities of our business partners or the inability of a significant portion of our or our business partners’ workforce to work because of illness, absenteeism, quarantine, vaccine mandates, or travel or other governmental restrictions. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain jurisdictions and markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, including changes in product and channel preferences that result in reduced sales or profit from the sale of our products. In addition, any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, which has resulted and may continue to result in our recording additional charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice, vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. 32 Table of Contents While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the possible emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, the availability, administration and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. During the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022 , we continued to experience inflationary pressures on transportation and commodity costs, which we expect to continue for the remainder of 2022. A number of external factors, including the deadly conflict in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation and commodity costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices. Risks Associated with Climate Change Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. These new or increased legal or regulatory requirements could result in significant increased costs of compliance and additional investments in facilities and equipment. However, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations. Risks Associated with International Operations In the 12 weeks ended September 3, 2022, our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of June, July and August . In the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January through August. In the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, our operations outside of the United States generated 43% of our consolidated net revenue, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa comprising approximately 22% of our consolidated net revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk in the international markets in whi ch our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In each of the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 3 percentage points primarily due to declines in the Turkish lira, euro, Egyptian pound, South African rand and British 33 Table of Contents pound sterling, partially offset by an appreciation of the Russian ruble. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, and natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely, including risks of additional impairments or write-offs, and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. See Notes 1 and 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, including impairment charges, recognized in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of September 3, 2022 and December 25, 2021 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of these items. Risks Associated with the Deadly Conflict in Ukraine In addition to the risks associated with international operations discussed above, we continue to face risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine. The conflict has continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, and the majority of our operations in Ukraine remain suspended. We have suspended sales to our customers of Pepsi-Cola and certain of our other global beverage brands, our discretionary capital investments and advertising and promotional activities in Russia, which has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business. We continue to offer our other products in Russia. Our operations in Russia and Ukraine, respectively, accounted for 6% and 0.2% of our consolidated net revenue for the 12 weeks ended September 3, 2022, 4% and 0.3% of our consolidated net revenue for the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, 5% and 0.6% of our consolidated net revenue for the 12 weeks ended September 4, 2021 and 4% and 0.5% of our consolidated net revenue for both the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021 and the year ended December 25, 2021. Our assets in Russia and Ukraine, respectively, were 5% and 0.1% of our consolidated assets as of September 3, 2022 and 5% and 0.3% of our consolidated assets as of December 25, 2021. Russia accounted for 30% and 35% of our accumulated currency translation adjustment loss as of September 3, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risks, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets or additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees, customers, operations or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business. See Notes 1 and 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, including i mpairment charges, recognized in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022. 34 Table of Contents The extent of the impact of these tragic events on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the conflic t, regional instability and ongoing and additional financial and economic sanctions, export controls and other legislation imposed by governments. We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve and to identify actions to potentially m itigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in increased regulatory focus on labeling in certain jurisdictions, including in Mexico which enacted product labeling requirements and limitations on the marketing of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. We sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. Retail Landscape Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Cautionary statements included above and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” in our 2021 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. 35 Table of Contents Results of Operations – Consolidated Review Consolidated Results Volume Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Financial Results – Volume” included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information on volume. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, unit volume growth adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. Further, unit volume growth will exclude the impact of an additional week of results every five or six years (53 rd reporting week), where applicable, including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We reported substantially all of our international volume on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis. The 12 weeks ended September 3, 2022 include volume outside of North America for the months of June, July and August . The 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022 include volume outside of North America for the months of January through August. Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 Change 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 Change Net revenue $ 21,971 $ 20,189 9 % $ 58,396 $ 54,226 8 % Operating profit $ 3,353 $ 3,159 6 % $ 10,697 $ 8,600 24 % Operating margin 15.3 % 15.6 % (0.3) 18.3 % 15.9 % 2.4 See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. 12 Weeks Operating profit increased 6% and operating margin declined 0.3 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by a 42-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, as well as certain operating cost increases. Higher mark-to-market losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses reduced operating profit growth by 4 percentage points. The operating margin decline primarily reflects the impact of higher mark-to-market losses on commodity derivatives. 36 Weeks Operating profit increased 24% and operating margin improved 2.4 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by a 39-percentage-point impact of the gain associated with the Juice Transaction, partially offset by a 16-percentage-point impact of the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a 5.5-percentage-point impact of the Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges. Operating profit growth was also driven by net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 36-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. 36 Table of Contents The operating margin improvement primarily reflects the impact of the gain associated with the Juice Transaction, partially offset by the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges. Juice Transaction In the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in the Tropicana JV, operating across North America and Europe. These juice businesses delivered approximately $3 billion in net revenue in 2021. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for Tropicana JV’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Results of Operations – Division Review While our financial results in North America are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis. This change did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. For our international operations, the months of June, July and August are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended September 3, 2022, and the months of January through August are reflected in our results for the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022. In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. See “Our Business Risks,” “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with GAAP. 37 Table of Contents Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

(b) Excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. In certain instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume growth disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between bottler case sales and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE). We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue. Operating Profit, Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis Operating profit adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit growth adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures.

Additionally, the Middle East and Pakistan each experienced double-digit growth and Nigeria experienced low-single-digit growth. 44 Table of Contents Operating profit increased 5%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by a 53-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily packaging materials and cooking oil, certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced operating profit growth by 7 percentage points. APAC 12 Weeks Net revenue increased 3%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and organic volume growth. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 5 percentage points. Convenient foods unit volume grew 3%, primarily reflecting mid-single-digit growth in China, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Thailand, a slight decline in Australia and a mid-single-digit decline in Taiwan. Beverage unit volume grew 9%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Vietnam and the Philippines. Additionally, China experienced low-single-digit growth and Thailand experienced mid-single-digit growth. Operating profit decreased 1%, primarily reflecti ng a 24-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil and potatoes, certain op erating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by the net revenue growth and productivity savings. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 5 percentage points. 36 Weeks Net revenue increased 5%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and organic volume growth, partially offset by a 2.5-percentage-point unfavorable impact of an extra month of net revenue in 2021 as we aligned Be & Cheery’s reporting calendar with that of our APAC division. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 3 percentage points. Convenient foods unit volume grew 4%, primarily reflecting mid-single-digit growth in China and Australia and high-single-digit growth in Thailand, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Taiwan. Beverage unit volume grew 9%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Vietnam and the Philippines. Additionally, China experienced high-single-digit growth and Thailand experienced mid-single-digit growth. Operating profit increased 3%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by a 16-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil and potatoes, certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 3-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Additionally, prior-year impairment charges associated with an equity method investment contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth. 45 Table of Contents Other Consolidated Results 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 Change 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 Change Other pension and retiree medical benefits income $ 36 $ 118 $ (82) $ 168 $ 364 $ (196) Net interest expense and other $ (190) $ (232) $ 42 $ (666) $ (731) $ 65 Tax rate 14.9 % 26.3 % 17.2 % 23.0 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo (a) $ 2,702 $ 2,224 21 % $ 8,392 $ 6,296 33 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted (a) $ 1.95 $ 1.60 22 % $ 6.04 $ 4.54 33 % (a) For the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, the gain associated with the Juice Transaction contributed to both net income attributable to PepsiCo growth and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share growth, partially offset by the impairment of intangible assets as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. See Notes 3 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 12 Weeks Other pension and retiree medical benefits income decreased $82 million, primarily due to higher settlement charges, higher interest cost due to an increase in discount rates and lower expected return on assets compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower amortization of experience loss resulting from plan changes. Net interest expense and other decreased $42 million, primarily due to higher interest rates on average cash balances and lower average debt balances, partially offset by losses on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. The reported tax rate decreased 11.4 percentage points, primarily reflecting an adjustment to reserves for uncertain tax positions as a result of our agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. 36 Weeks Other pension and retiree medical benefits income decreased $196 million, primarily due to higher settlement charges compared to the prior year. Net interest expense and other decreased $65 million, primarily due to higher interest rates on average cash balances, lower average debt balances and lower interest rates on average debt balances, partially offset by losses on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability and lower average cash balances . The reported tax rate decreased 5.8 percentage points, primarily reflecting the impact of the Juice Transaction and an adjustment to reserves for uncertain tax positions as a result of our agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. 46 Table of Contents We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts (including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses); charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, certain immaterial pension and retiree medical-related settlement and curtailment gains and losses were not considered items affecting comparability. Pension and retiree medical-related service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs will continue to be reflected in our core results. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q are discussed below: Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, gain associated with the Juice Transaction, impairment of intangible assets, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Productivity Plan, charges associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, the gain associated with the Juice Transaction, Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges, the impact of settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans, the tax benefit related to the IRS audit and the tax expense related to the TCJ Act (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, and where applicable, the impact of the 53 rd reporting week, including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We believe organic revenue 47 Table of Contents growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-Q are impacted by the following items in each of the following periods: 12 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Gain associated with the Juice Transaction Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 10,308 $ 11,663 $ 8,295 $ 14 $ 1 $ 3,353 $ 36 $ 475 $ 2,702 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (54) 54 (112) — — 166 — 40 126 Restructuring and impairment charges (1) 1 (50) — — 51 — 11 40 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (5) — — 5 — 2 3 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction — — — (14) — 14 — 3 11 Russia-Ukraine conflict charges (1) 1 5 — — (4) — 1 (5) Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges (10) 10 1 — (1) 10 — 2 8 Pension and retiree medical-related impact — — — — — — 59 13 46 Tax benefit related to the IRS audit — — — — — — — 284 (284) Tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — — — — (86) 86 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 10,242 $ 11,729 $ 8,134 $ — $ — $ 3,595 $ 95 $ 745 $ 2,733 48 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended 9/4/2021 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 9,394 $ 10,795 $ 7,636 $ 3,159 $ 118 $ 802 $ 2,224 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (15) 15 (19) 34 — 8 26 Restructuring and impairment charges (9) 9 (42) 51 1 7 45 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — 3 (3) — (1) (2) Tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — — (190) 190 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 9,370 $ 10,819 $ 7,578 $ 3,241 $ 119 $ 626 $ 2,483 36 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Gain associated with the Juice Transaction Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 27,156 $ 31,240 $ 22,262 $ (3,321) $ 1,602 $ 10,697 $ 168 $ 1,756 $ 51 $ 8,392 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 1 (1) 43 — — (44) — (11) — (33) Restructuring and impairment charges (6) 6 (117) — — 123 3 25 1 100 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (63) — — 63 6 12 — 57 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction — — — 3,321 — (3,321) — (452) — (2,869) Russia-Ukraine conflict charges (134) 134 (70) — (1,198) 1,402 — 239 — 1,163 Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges (18) 18 (53) — (404) 475 — 111 — 364 Pension and retiree medical-related impact — — — — — — 174 39 — 135 Tax benefit related to the IRS audit — — — — — — — 284 — (284) Tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — — — — (86) — 86 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 26,999 $ 31,397 $ 22,002 $ — $ — $ 9,395 $ 351 $ 1,917 $ 52 $ 7,111 49 Table of Contents 36 Weeks Ended 9/4/2021 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 24,945 $ 29,281 $ 20,681 $ 8,600 $ 364 $ 1,895 $ 6,296 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 21 (21) 40 (61) — (13) (48) Restructuring and impairment charges (13) 13 (110) 123 6 20 109 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges (1) 1 (11) 12 — — 12 Tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — — (190) 190 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 24,952 $ 29,274 $ 20,600 $ 8,674 $ 370 $ 1,712 $ 6,559 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 Change 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 Change Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, GAAP measure $ 1.95 $ 1.60 22 % $ 6.04 $ 4.54 33 % Mark-to-market net impact 0.09 0.02 (0.02) (0.03) Restructuring and impairment charges 0.03 0.03 0.07 0.08 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — 0.04 0.01 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction 0.01 — (2.07) — Russia-Ukraine conflict charges — — 0.84 — Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges 0.01 — 0.26 — Pension and retiree medical-related impact 0.03 — 0.10 — Tax benefit related to the IRS audit (0.20) — (0.20) — Tax expense related to the TCJ Act 0.06 0.14 0.06 0.14 Core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, non-GAAP measure $ 1.97 (a) $ 1.79 10 % $ 5.12 $ 4.73 (a) 8 % Impact of foreign exchange translation 3 2 Growth in core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP measure 14 % (a) 11 % (a) (a) Does not sum due to rounding. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. 50 Table of Contents Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the second quarter of 2021, we expanded and extended the program through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the 2019 Productivity Plan. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.4 billion. Plan to date through September 3, 2022, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.2 billion, including cash expenditures of $911 million. For the remainder of 2022, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $200 million, and cash expenditures of approximately $75 million. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2023 through 2024 financial results, with the balance to be incurred through 2026. Charges include severance and other employee costs, asset impairments and other costs. See Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K, for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Merger and integration charges include changes in fair value of contingent consideration, liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, employee-related costs, contract termination costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees. See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Gain Associated with the Juice Transaction We recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PBNA and Europe divisions. See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Russia-Ukraine Conflict Charges In connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs. See Notes 1 and 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges We recognized intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment and other charges as a result of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands. See Notes 1 and 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest cost, partially offset by curtailment gains resulting from the Juice Transaction. See Notes 6 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 51 Table of Contents Tax Benefit Related to the IRS Audit We recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. See Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Tax Expense Related to the TCJ Act Tax expense related to the TCJ Act reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. See Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion from the Juice Transaction, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See “Our Business Risks” and Notes 7 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the conflict. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the Russia-Ukraine conflict may have on our business and financial results. See “Our Business Risks,” Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information related to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business and financial results. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by COVID-19 in the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business and financial results. See “Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results. 52 Table of Contents As of September 3, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of September 3, 2022, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.6 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. See “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further discussion of the TCJ Act. As part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We were informed by the participating financial institutions that as of September 3, 2022 and December 25, 2021, $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers who participate in these financing arrangements are outstanding. These supply chain finance arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. Operating Activities During the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $6.3 billion, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $6.6 billion in the prior-year period. The decrease in operating cash flow primarily reflects unfavorable working capital comparisons and higher net cash tax payments, partially offset by favorable operating profit performance and lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year. Investing Activities During the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022 , net cash provided by investing activities was $0.3 billion, primarily reflecting proceeds associated with the Juice Transaction of $3.5 billion, partially offset by net capital spending of $2.3 billion and our investment in Celsius convertible preferred stock and agreement to distribute Celsius energy drinks of $0.7 billion. We regularly review our plans with respect to ne t capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs. 53 Table of Contents Financing Activities During the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2022, net cash used for financing activities was $5.6 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments of $4.6 billion and share repurchases of $1.2 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $1.7 billion and debt redemptions of $1.6 billi on, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $3.4 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 10, 2022, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on February 11, 2022 and will expire on February 28, 2026. In addition, on February 10, 2022, we announced a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.60 per share from $4.30 per share, effective with the dividend paid in June 2022. We expect to return a total of approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2022, comprising dividends of approximately $6.2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion. Free Cash Flow The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow, see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 36 Weeks Ended 9/3/2022 9/4/2021 Net cash provided by operating activities, GAAP measure $ 6,306 $ 6,634 Capital spending (2,556) (2,276) Sales of property, plant and equipment 228 40 Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ 3,978 $ 4,398 We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2021 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information. Material Changes in Line Items in Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated statement of income are discussed in “Results of Operations – Division Review” and “Items Affecting Comparability.” 54 Table of Contents Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows are discussed in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated balance sheet are discussed below: Total Assets As of September 3, 2022, total assets were $94.5 billion, compared to $92.4 billion as of December 25, 2021. The increase in total assets is primarily driven by the following line items: Change (a) Reference Cash and cash equivalents $ 0.8 Statement of Cash Flows Accounts and notes receivable, less allowance $ 2.1 (b) Inventories $ 0.7 (c) Assets held for sale $ (1.8) (d) Other indefinite-lived intangible assets $ (1.3) Note 3 Investments in noncontrolled affiliates $ 0.9 Note 11 Other assets $ 0.5 (e) Total Liabilities As of September 3, 2022, total liabilities were $75.3 billion, compared to $76.2 billion as of December 25, 2021. The decrease in total liabilities is primarily driven by the following line items: Change (a) Reference Short-term debt obligations $ (1.2) (f) Accounts payable and other current liabilities $ 1.4 (g) Liabilities held for sale $ (0.8) (d) (a) In billions.

Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 25, 2021, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 9, 2022, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 25, 2021, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York October 11, 2022 56 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the 12 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses in phases over the next several years. In connection with these ERP implementations, we are updating and will continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. During the 12 weeks ended September 3, 2022, we continued implementing these systems, resulting in changes that materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with this multi-year productivity plan and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These business process changes have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Except with respect to the continued implementation of ERP systems, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the 12 weeks ended September 3, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting as we continue to implement our ERP solution and our 2019 multi-year productivity plan. 57 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. The following information should be read in conjunction with the discussion set forth under Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our 2021 Form 10-K. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See also “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2021 Form 10-K. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. The following additional risk factor should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2021 Form 10-K and our Form 10-Qs for the fiscal quarter ended March 19, 2022 (Q1 2022 Form 10-Q) and the fiscal quarter ended June 11, 2022 (Q2 2022 Form 10-Q). The developments described below have heightened, or in some cases manifested, certain of the risks disclosed in the risk factor section of our 2021 Form 10-K, and such risk factors are further qualified by the information relating to our operations in Russia and Ukraine as described in this Form 10-Q and our Q1 2022 Form 10-Q and Q2 2022 Form 10-Q, including in the additional risk factor below. You should carefully consider the risks described below and in our 2021 Form 10-K, Q1 2022 Form 10-Q and Q2 2022 Form 10-Q in addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, our Q2 2022 Form 10-Q, our Q1 2022 Form 10-Q and in our 2021 Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. These risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance, which in turn can affect the price of our publicly traded securities. The risks described below and in our 2021 Form 10-K, our Q1 2022 Form 10-Q and our Q2 2022 Form 10-Q are not the only risks we face. There may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but that may become material in the future. Therefore, historical operating results, financial and business performance, events and trends are often not a reliable indicator of future operating results, financial and business performance, events or trends. Risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine The deadly conflict in Ukraine has continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty and the majority of our operations in Ukraine remain su spended. We have suspended sales to our customers of Pepsi-Cola and certain of our other global beverage brands, our discretionary capital investments and advertising and promotional activities in Russia. We plan to continue to offer our other products in Russia. The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risk, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging and raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets or result in additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent 58 Table of Contents to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees, operations, customers or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The c onflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business. ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

See accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 8 Table of Contents Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 25, 2021 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021 (2021 Form 10-K). This report should be read in conjunction with our 2021 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. While our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis. This change did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. For our international operations, the months of March, April and May are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended June 11, 2022, and the months of January through May are reflected in our results for the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates. Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. 9 Table of Contents Our Divisions We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada; 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe; 6) Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region. Net revenue of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 FLNA $ 5,181 $ 4,552 $ 10,020 $ 8,788 QFNA 675 575 1,388 1,221 PBNA 6,120 6,156 11,473 11,230 LatAm 2,415 1,967 3,889 3,209 Europe 3,023 3,286 4,820 5,081 AMESA 1,696 1,602 2,700 2,485 APAC 1,115 1,079 2,135 2,023 Total $ 20,225 $ 19,217 $ 36,425 $ 34,037 10 Table of Contents Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products to our customers. The following tables reflect the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our convenient food business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue: 12 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 Beverages (a) Convenient Foods Beverages (a) Convenient Foods LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 50 % 50 % 55 % 45 % AMESA 35 % 65 % 35 % 65 % APAC 25 % 75 % 25 % 75 % PepsiCo 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % 24 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 Beverages (a) Convenient Foods Beverages (a) Convenient Foods LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 50 % 50 % 55 % 45 % AMESA 30 % 70 % 30 % 70 % APAC 20 % 80 % 20 % 80 % PepsiCo 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % (a) Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe divisions, is over 35 % of our consolidated net revenue in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, and approximately 40 % of our consolidated net revenue in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue but lower operating margin as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. Operating profit of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 FLNA $ 1,448 $ 1,382 $ 2,744 $ 2,622 QFNA 135 128 294 278 PBNA (a) (b) 651 809 4,085 1,175 LatAm (c) 420 356 743 574 Europe (a) (d) ( 797 ) 405 ( 933 ) 536 AMESA 290 256 470 394 APAC 206 192 421 400 Total divisions 2,353 3,528 7,824 5,979 Corporate unallocated expenses (e) (f) ( 276 ) ( 399 ) ( 480 ) ( 538 ) Total $ 2,077 $ 3,129 $ 7,344 $ 5,441 (a) In the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we recorded a gain of $ 3.0 billion and $ 298 million in our PBNA and Europe divisions, respectively, associated with the Juice Transaction.

See Note 3 for further information. 11 Table of Contents (c) In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we made the decision to sell or discontinue certain non-strategic brands in our LatAm division.

Note 2 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in 2021, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $ 2.4 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 10 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 35 % for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives.

A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan activity for the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022 is as follows: Severance and Other Employee Costs Other Costs Total Liability as of December 25, 2021 $ 64 $ 7 $ 71 2022 restructuring charges 31 44 75 Cash payments ( 37 ) ( 45 ) ( 82 ) Non-cash charges and translation ( 3 ) ( 1 ) ( 4 ) Liability as of June 11, 2022 $ 55 $ 5 $ 60 Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at June 11, 2022 is expected to be paid by the end of 2022. Other Productivity Initiatives There were no charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives described above. For information on other impairment charges, see Notes 1 and 3 for Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges and Russia-Ukraine Conflict Charges. 14 Table of Contents Note 3 - Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. During the 12 weeks ended June 11, 2022, macroeconomic factors, sanctions and other regulations as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict indicated a material deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital. These factors required us to perform a quantitative assessment, despite the absence of a material adverse impact on these assets’ financial performance (e.g., sales, operating profit, cash flows). The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeds the fair value, with the decrease in the fair value primarily attributable to a significant increase in the weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the macroeconomic uncertainty in Russia. As a result of the quantitative assessment, in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $ 1.2 billion ($ 958 million after-tax or $ 0.69 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, related to our juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. See Note 1 for further information. During the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we discontinued or repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. As a result, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges (Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges) of $ 241 million ($ 193 million after-tax or $ 0.14 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to indefinite-lived intangible assets. In light of the current political and economic environment, we will continue to review and analyze our brand portfolio worldwide. See Note 1 for further information. For further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K. 15 Table of Contents A summary of our amortizable intangible assets is as follows: 6/11/2022 12/25/2021 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Acquired franchise rights (a) $ 851 $ ( 196 ) $ 655 $ 976 $ ( 187 ) $ 789 Customer relationships 617 ( 243 ) 374 623 ( 227 ) 396 Brands 1,119 ( 983 ) 136 1,151 ( 989 ) 162 Other identifiable intangibles 444 ( 261 ) 183 451 ( 260 ) 191 Total $ 3,031 $ ( 1,683 ) $ 1,348 $ 3,201 $ ( 1,663 ) $ 1,538 (a) Decrease is primarily due to the write-off of our distribution rights for Bang Energy drinks.

The assessment included both agreed and unagreed issues. On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals conference. As a result of the analysis of the 2014 through 2016 final assessment, we remeasured all applicable reserves for uncertain tax positions for all years open under the statute of limitations, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax expense of $ 112 million in 2021. There were no tax amounts recognized in the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022 and June 12, 2021 from this assessment. Note 5 - Share-Based Compensation The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 Share-based compensation expense – equity awards $ 75 $ 65 $ 156 $ 144 Share-based compensation expense – liability awards 7 — 12 4 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — 3 — Restructuring charges 1 — — 1 Total $ 83 $ 65 $ 171 $ 149 The following table summarizes share-based awards granted under the terms of the PepsiCo, Inc.

All grant activity is disclosed at target. We granted long-term cash awards to certain executive officers and other senior executives with an aggregate target value of $ 18 million and $ 17 million during the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022 and June 12, 2021, respectively. For the 12 weeks ended June 11, 2022 and June 12, 2021, our grants of stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards were nominal. Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: 24 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 Expected life 7 years 7 years Risk-free interest rate 1.7 % 1.1 % Expected volatility 16 % 14 % Expected dividend yield 2.5 % 3.1 % 18 Table of Contents Note 6 - Pension and Retiree Medical Benefits In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we recognized a pre-tax settlement charge of $ 131 million ($ 101 million after-tax or $ 0.07 per share) in a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan due to lump sum distributions to retired or terminated employees. The settlement charge was triggered when the cumulative lump sum distributions exceeded the total annual service and interest cost in 2022. As a result, related plan assets and benefit obligations were remeasured using assumptions as of June 11, 2022, the remeasurement date. The weighted-average discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit plans’ projected benefit obligations increased from 2.9 % to 3.4 % as a result of the remeasurement. In addition, the U.S. defined benefit pension plans’ weighted-average interest cost discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to determine 2022 net periodic benefit cost/(income) increased from 2.4 % and 6.3 % to 3.1 % and 6.7 %, respectively. For further information on our policies for pension, retiree-medical and savings plans, refer to Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K. In the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we transferred pension and retiree medical obligations of $ 145 million and related assets to the Tropicana JV in connection with the Juice Transaction.

During the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022 and June 12, 2021, we made discretionary contributions of $ 75 million and $ 300 million, respectively, to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans, and $ 10 million and $ 25 million, respectively, to our international defined benefit plans. We expect to make an additional discretionary contribution of $ 75 million to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in the third quarter of 2022. Note 7 - Debt Obligations In the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, $ 1.7 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes matured and were paid . In addition, in the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we paid $ 750 million to redeem all $ 750 million outstanding principal amount of our 2.25 % senior notes due May 2022, and we paid $ 800 million to redeem all $ 800 million outstanding principal amount of our 3.10 % senior notes due July 2022. As of June 11, 2022, we had $ 2.8 billion of commercial paper outstanding. In the second quarter of 2022, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement), which expires on May 27, 2027. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.8 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $ 0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.75 billion five-year credit agreement, dated as of May 28, 2021. 20 Table of Contents Also in the second quarter of 2022, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires on May 26, 2023. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.8 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of May 28, 2021. Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of June 11, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement. Note 8 - Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. There have been no material changes during the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022 with respect to our risk management policies or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K. We continue to evaluate our hedging strategies related to our Russian business based on the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on financial markets. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of June 11, 2022 was $ 353 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of June 11, 2022. The notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of June 11, 2022 and December 25, 2021 are as follows: Notional Amounts (a) 6/11/2022 12/25/2021 Commodity $ 1.7 $ 1.6 Foreign exchange $ 2.3 $ 2.8 Interest rate $ 2.1 $ 2.1 Net investment (b) $ 2.0 $ 2.1 (a) In billions. (b) The total notional of our net investment hedge consists of non-derivative debt instruments. As of June 11, 2022, approximately 8 % of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to 2 % as of December 25, 2021. 21 Table of Contents Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities Investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. As of June 11, 2022, we had no investments in debt securities. As of December 25, 2021, we had $ 130 million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. As of December 25, 2021, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material. Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of June 11, 2022 and December 25, 2021 are categorized as follows: 6/11/2022 12/25/2021 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Index funds (b) 1 $ 279 $ — $ 337 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (c) 2 $ 13 $ — $ 21 $ — Deferred compensation (d) 2 $ — $ 440 $ — $ 505 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (e) 2 $ 14 $ 42 $ 29 $ 14 Interest rate (e) 2 20 349 14 264 Commodity (f) 2 22 30 70 5 $ 56 $ 421 $ 113 $ 283 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (e) 2 $ 6 $ 9 $ 19 $ 7 Commodity (f) 2 46 25 35 22 $ 52 $ 34 $ 54 $ 29 Total derivatives at fair value (g) $ 108 $ 455 $ 167 $ 312 Total $ 400 $ 895 $ 525 $ 817 (a) Fair value hierarchy levels are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) in both years. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities. (b) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (c) Based primarily on the price of our common stock. (d) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections. (e) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates. (f) Primarily based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements. (g) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of June 11, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table. 22 Table of Contents The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of June 11, 2022 and December 25, 2021 was $ 37 billion and $ 43 billion, respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs. Losses/(gains) on our hedging instruments are categorized as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Fair Value/Non- designated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Income Statement (a) Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (b) 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 Foreign exchange $ 21 $ 6 $ 26 $ 27 $ ( 17 ) $ 27 Interest rate — — 82 ( 46 ) 61 ( 47 ) Commodity ( 181 ) ( 70 ) ( 1 ) ( 156 ) ( 74 ) ( 33 ) Net investment — — ( 88 ) 55 — — Total $ ( 160 ) $ ( 64 ) $ 19 $ ( 120 ) $ ( 30 ) $ ( 53 ) 24 Weeks Ended Fair Value/Non- designated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Income Statement (a) Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (b) 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 Foreign exchange $ 5 $ 10 $ 18 $ 38 $ ( 21 ) $ 40 Interest rate — 1 79 ( 64 ) 81 ( 51 ) Commodity ( 347 ) ( 151 ) ( 190 ) ( 246 ) ( 152 ) ( 43 ) Net investment — — ( 139 ) ( 8 ) — — Total $ ( 342 ) $ ( 140 ) $ ( 232 ) $ ( 280 ) $ ( 92 ) $ ( 54 ) (a) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. (b) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains on cross-currency interest rate swaps are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. Based on current market conditions, we expect to reclassify net gains of $ 137 million related to our cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income during the next 12 months. 23 Table of Contents Note 9 - Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share The computations of basic and diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 Income Shares (a) Income Shares (a) Basic net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 1.03 $ 1.71 Net income available for PepsiCo common shareholders $ 1,429 1,382 $ 2,358 1,382 Dilutive securities: Stock options, RSUs, PSUs and other (b) — 7 — 6 Diluted $ 1,429 1,389 $ 2,358 1,388 Diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 1.03 $ 1.70 24 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 Income Shares (a) Income Shares (a) Basic net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 4.11 $ 2.95 Net income available for PepsiCo common shareholders $ 5,690 1,383 $ 4,072 1,381 Dilutive securities: Stock options, RSUs, PSUs and other (b) — 7 — 6 Diluted $ 5,690 1,390 $ 4,072 1,387 Diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 4.09 $ 2.94 (a) Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions).

(Pioneer Foods), Rockstar Energy Beverages (Rockstar) and Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. (Be & Cheery). The purchase price allocations for each of these acquisitions were finalized in the second quarter of 2021. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information. Juice Transaction In the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for approximately $ 3.5 billion in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, and a 39 % noncontrolling interest in the Tropicana JV, operating across North America and Europe. The North America portion of the transaction was completed on January 24, 2022 and the Europe portion of the transaction was completed on February 1, 2022. In the U.S., PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for Tropicana JV’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. We have significant influence over our investment in the Tropicana JV and account for our 26 Table of Contents investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of Tropicana JV’s earnings within our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). As a result of this transaction, in the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 3.3 billion ($ 2.9 billion after-tax or $ 2.07 per share) in our PBNA and Europe divisions, including $ 525 million related to the remeasurement of our 39 % ownership in the Tropicana JV at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, discounted cash flows and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in the Tropicana J V. In the 12 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we recorded certain purchase price adjustments for net working capital and net debt amounts, which resulted in an increase in the transaction price and the recognition of an incremental pre-tax gain of $ 13 million ($ 10 million after-tax or $ 0.01 per share) in our PBNA division. The purchase price will continue to be adjusted for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement. A summary of income statement activity related to the Juice Transaction in the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022 is as follows: PBNA Europe Corporate Total PepsiCo Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Impact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share Gain associated with the Juice Transaction $ ( 3,037 ) $ ( 298 ) $ — $ ( 3,335 ) $ 455 $ ( 2,880 ) $ 2.07 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges 39 13 6 58 ( 10 ) 48 ( 0.04 ) Operating profit $ ( 2,998 ) $ ( 285 ) $ 6 ( 3,277 ) 445 ( 2,832 ) 2.04 (c) Other pension and retiree medical benefits income (b) ( 10 ) 3 ( 7 ) 0.01 Total Juice Transaction $ ( 3,287 ) $ 448 $ ( 2,839 ) $ 2.04 (c) (a) Includes $ 195 million of deferred tax expense related to the recognition of our investment in the Tropicana JV. (b) Includes $ 16 million curtailment gain, partially offset by $ 6 million special termination benefits. (c) Does not sum due to rounding. In connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement with PAI Partners, under which we provide certain services to the Tropicana JV to help facilitate an orderly transition of the business following the sale. In return for these services, the Tropicana JV is required to pay certain agreed upon fees to reimburse us for our costs without markup. Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Merger and integration charges include changes in fair value of contingent consideration, liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, employee-related costs, contract termination costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees. 27 Table of Contents A summary of our acquisition and divestiture-related charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 Transaction FLNA $ — $ — $ — $ 2 BFY Brands, Inc.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL REVIEW Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies and estimates below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2021 Form 10-K. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of 28 Table of Contents each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Income Taxes In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur. Our Business Risks This Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine; the impact of COVID-19; future demand for PepsiCo’s products; damage to PepsiCo’s reputation or brand image; product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety; PepsiCo’s ability to compete effectively; PepsiCo’s ability to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce; water scarcity; changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer; disruption of PepsiCo’s manufacturing operations or supply chain, including increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs; political or social conditions in the markets where PepsiCo’s products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCo’s ability to grow its business in developing and emerging markets; changes in economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems; failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions; PepsiCo’s reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems; climate change or measures to address climate change; strikes or work stoppages; failure to realize benefits from PepsiCo’s productivity initiatives; deterioration in estimates and underlying assumptions regarding future performance that can result in an impairment charge; fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCo’s credit ratings; imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo’s products; imposition of limitations on the marketing or sale of PepsiCo’s products; changes in laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials; failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities; failure to adequately protect PepsiCo’s intellectual property rights or infringement on intellectual property rights of others; failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; and potential liabilities and costs from litigation, 29 Table of Contents claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other risks and uncertainties including those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2021 Form 10-K and in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. COVID-19 Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous measures have been implemented around the world to try to reduce the spread of the virus and these measures have impacted and will continue to impact us, our business partners and our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic, including these measures, may continue to result in changes in demand for our products, increases in employee and other operating costs or supply chain disruptions, any of which can impact our ability to operate our business. In addition, we may continue to experience business disruptions resulting from the temporary closures of our facilities or facilities of our business partners or the inability of a significant portion of our or our business partners’ workforce to work because of illness, absenteeism, quarantine, vaccine mandates, or travel or other governmental restrictions. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain jurisdictions and markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, including changes in product and channel preferences that result in reduced sales or profit from the sale of our products. In addition, any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, which has resulted and may continue to result in our recording additional charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice, vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the possible emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, the availability, administration and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. During the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022 , we continued to experience inflationary pressures on transportation and commodity costs, which we expect to continue for the remainder of 2022. A number of external factors, including the deadly conflict in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation and commodity 30 Table of Contents costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices. Risks Associated with Climate Change Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. These new or increased legal or regulatory requirements could result in significant increased costs of compliance and additional investments in facilities and equipment. However, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations. Risks Associated with International Operations In the 12 weeks ended June 11, 2022, our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of March, April and May . In the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January through May. In the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, our operations outside of the United States generated 41% of our consolidated net revenue, with Mexico, Canada, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa comprising approximately 22% of our consolidated net revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk in the international markets in whi ch our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 3 percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively, primarily due to declines in the Turkish lira, euro, Russian ruble and Egyptian pound. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, and natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely, including risks of additional impairments or write-offs, and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. See Notes 1 and 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for a discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, including impairment charges, recognized in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of June 11, 2022 and December 25, 2021 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of these items. Risks Associated with the Deadly Conflict in Ukraine In addition to the risks associated with international operations discussed above, we continue to face risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine. The conflict has continued to result in worldwide 31 Table of Contents geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, and the majority of our operations in Ukraine remain suspended. We are in the process of suspending sales of Pepsi-Cola and certain of our other global beverage brands and have suspended our discretionary capital investments and advertising and promotional activities in Russia, which has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business. We continue to offer our other products in Russia. Our operations in Russia and Ukraine, respectively, accounted for 4% and 0.2% of our consolidated net revenue for the 12 weeks ended June 11, 2022, 4% and 0.3% of our consolidated net revenue for the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022 and 4% and 0.5% of our consolidated net revenue for both the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021 and the year ended December 25, 2021. Our assets in Russia and Ukraine, respectively, were 5% and 0.3% of our consolidated assets as of December 25, 2021 and 4% and 0.1% of our consolidated assets as of June 11, 2022 . The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risks, heightened risks to employee safety, significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing c onflict could result in loss of assets or result in additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our customers, operations or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business. See Notes 1 and 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for a discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, including impairment charges, recognized in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022. The extent of the impact of these tragic events on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the conflic t, regional instability and ongoing and additional financial and economic sanctions and export controls imposed by governments. We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve and to identify actions to potentially m itigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in increased regulatory focus on labeling in certain jurisdictions, including in Mexico which enacted product labeling requirements and limitations on the marketing of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. We sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, 32 Table of Contents regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. Retail Landscape Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Cautionary statements included above and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” in our 2021 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. Results of Operations – Consolidated Review Consolidated Results Volume Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Financial Results – Volume” included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information on volume. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, unit volume growth adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. Further, unit volume growth will exclude the impact of an additional week of results every five or six years (53 rd reporting week), where applicable, including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We reported substantially all of our international volume on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis. The 12 weeks ended June 11, 2022 include volume outside of North America for the months of March, April and May . The 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022 include volume outside of North America for the months of January through May. 33 Table of Contents Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 Change 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 Change Net revenue $ 20,225 $ 19,217 5 % $ 36,425 $ 34,037 7 % Operating profit $ 2,077 $ 3,129 (34) % $ 7,344 $ 5,441 35 % Operating margin 10.3 % 16.3 % (6.0) 20.2 % 16.0 % 4.2 See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. 12 Weeks Operating profit decreased 34% and operating margin declined 6.0 percentage points. Operating profit performance was primarily driven b y a 37-percentage-point impact of the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a 7-percentage-point impact of the Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges, partially offset by a 2.5-percentage-point impact of higher mark-to-market gains on commodity derivatives. Operating profit performance was also positively impacted by net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 36-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. Additionally, gains on sales of assets positively contributed 5 percentage points to operating profit performance. The operating margin decline primarily reflects the impact of the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges. 24 Weeks Operating profit grew 35% and operating margin improved 4.2 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by a 61-percentage-point impact of the gain associated with the Juice Transaction, partially offset by a 26-percentage-point impact of the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a 9-percentage-point impact of Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges. Operating profit growth was also driven by net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 33-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. Additionally, gains on sales of assets contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth. The operating margin improvement primarily reflects the impact of the gain associated with the Juice Transaction, partially offset by the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges. Juice Transaction In the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in the Tropicana JV, operating across North America and Europe. These juice businesses delivered approximately $3 billion in net revenue in 2021. In the U.S., PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for Tropicana JV’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Results of Operations – Division Review While our financial results in North America are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis. This change did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. For our international operations, the months of March, April and May are reflected in our results for the 12 34 Table of Contents weeks ended June 11, 2022, and the months of January through May are reflected in our results for the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022. In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. See “Our Business Risks,” “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with GAAP. Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

(b) Excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. In certain instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume growth disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between bottler case sales and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE). We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue. Operating Profit, Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis Operating profit adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit growth adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures.

Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in 43 Table of Contents this Form 10-Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts (including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses); charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, certain immaterial pension and retiree medical-related settlement and curtailment gains and losses were not considered items affecting comparability. Pension and retiree medical-related service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs will continue to be reflected in our core results. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q are discussed below: Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, gain associated with the Juice Transaction, impairment of intangible assets, other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Productivity Plan, charges associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, the gain associated with the Juice Transaction, Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges, and the impact of settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, and where applicable, the impact of the 44 Table of Contents 53 rd reporting week, including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. 45 Table of Contents Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-Q are impacted by the following items in each of the following periods: 12 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Gain associated with the Juice Transaction Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 9,415 $ 10,810 $ 7,387 $ (13) $ 1,359 $ 2,077 $ (2) $ 393 $ 17 $ 1,429 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 22 (22) 76 — — (98) — (25) — (73) Restructuring and impairment charges — — (45) — — 45 3 8 1 39 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (8) — — 8 — 1 — 7 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction — — — 13 — (13) — (3) — (10) Russia-Ukraine conflict charges 7 (7) 25 — (1,197) 1,165 — 238 — 927 Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges (8) 8 (54) — (162) 224 — 61 — 163 Pension and retiree medical-related impact — — — — — — 131 30 — 101 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 9,436 $ 10,789 $ 7,381 $ — $ — $ 3,408 $ 132 $ 703 $ 18 $ 2,583 12 Weeks Ended 6/12/2021 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 8,880 $ 10,337 $ 7,208 $ 3,129 $ 126 $ 642 $ 2,358 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact — — 20 (20) — (4) (16) Restructuring and impairment charges (2) 2 (33) 35 (1) 5 29 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges (1) 1 (24) 25 — 4 21 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 8,877 $ 10,340 $ 7,171 $ 3,169 $ 125 $ 647 $ 2,392 46 Table of Contents 24 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Gain associated with the Juice Transaction Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 16,848 $ 19,577 $ 13,967 $ (3,335) $ 1,601 $ 7,344 $ 132 $ 1,281 $ 29 $ 5,690 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 55 (55) 155 — — (210) — (51) — (159) Restructuring and impairment charges (5) 5 (67) — — 72 3 14 1 60 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (58) — — 58 6 10 — 54 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction — — — 3,335 — (3,335) — (455) — (2,880) Russia-Ukraine conflict charges (133) 133 (75) — (1,198) 1,406 — 238 — 1,168 Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges (8) 8 (54) — (403) 465 — 109 — 356 Pension and retiree medical-related impact — — — — — — 115 26 — 89 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 16,757 $ 19,668 $ 13,868 $ — $ — $ 5,800 $ 256 $ 1,172 $ 30 $ 4,378 24 Weeks Ended 6/12/2021 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 15,551 $ 18,486 $ 13,045 $ 5,441 $ 246 $ 1,093 $ 4,072 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 36 (36) 59 (95) — (21) (74) Restructuring and impairment charges (4) 4 (68) 72 5 13 64 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges (1) 1 (14) 15 — 1 14 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 15,582 $ 18,455 $ 13,022 $ 5,433 $ 251 $ 1,086 $ 4,076 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. 47 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 Change 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 Change Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, GAAP measure $ 1.03 $ 1.70 (39) % $ 4.09 $ 2.94 39 % Mark-to-market net impact (0.05) (0.01) (0.11) (0.05) Restructuring and impairment charges 0.03 0.02 0.04 0.05 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges 0.01 0.02 0.04 0.01 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction (0.01) — (2.07) — Russia-Ukraine conflict charges 0.67 — 0.84 — Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges 0.12 — 0.26 — Pension and retiree medical-related impact 0.07 — 0.06 — Core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, non-GAAP measure $ 1.86 (a) $ 1.72 (a) 8 % $ 3.15 $ 2.94 (a) 7 % Impact of foreign exchange translation 2 2 Growth in core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP measure 10 % 9 % (a) Does not sum due to rounding. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the second quarter of 2021, we expanded and extended the program through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the 2019 Productivity Plan. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.4 billion. Plan to date through June 11, 2022, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.1 billion, including cash expenditures of $859 million. For the remainder of 2022, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $200 million, and cash expenditures of approximately $175 million. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2022 through 2024 financial results, with the balance to be incurred through 2026. Charges include severance and other employee costs, asset impairments and other costs. 48 Table of Contents See Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K, for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Merger and integration charges include changes in fair value of contingent consideration, liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, employee-related costs, contract termination costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees. See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Gain Associated with the Juice Transaction We recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PBNA and Europe divisions. See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Russia-Ukraine Conflict Charges In connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs. See Notes 1 and 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges We recognized intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment and other charges as a result of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands. See Notes 1 and 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest cost, partially offset by curtailment gains resulting from the Juice Transaction. See Notes 6 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion from the Juice Transaction, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See “Our Business Risks” and Notes 7 and 11 to our condensed consolidated 49 Table of Contents financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the conflict. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the Russia-Ukraine conflict may have on our business and financial results. See “Our Business Risks,” Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-Q for further information related to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business and financial results. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by COVID-19 in the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business and financial results. See “Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results. As of June 11, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of June 11, 2022, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.6 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. See “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further discussion of the TCJ Act. As part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We were informed by the participating financial institutions that as of June 11, 2022 and December 25, 2021, $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers who participate in these 50 Table of Contents financing arrangements are outstanding. These supply chain finance arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. Operating Activities During the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.3 billion in the prior-year period. The decrease in operating cash flow primarily reflects unfavorable working capital comparisons and higher net cash tax payments, partially offset by favorable operating profit performance and lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year. Investing Activities During the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, net cash provided by investing activities was $2.2 billion, primarily reflecting proceeds associated with the Juice Transaction of $3.5 billion, partially offset by net capital spending of $1.3 billion. We regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs. Financing Activities During the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, net cash used for financing activities was $4.1 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders, through dividend payments of $3.0 billion and share repurchases of $0.7 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $1.7 billion an d debt redemptions of $1.6 billion, partially offset by net proceeds of short-term borrowings of $2.8 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 10, 2022, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on February 11, 2022 and will expire on February 28, 2026. In addition, on February 10, 2022, we announced a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.60 per share from $4.30 per share, effective with the dividend paid in June 2022. We expect to return a total of approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2022, comprising dividends of approximately $6.2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion. Free Cash Flow The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 24 Weeks Ended 6/11/2022 6/12/2021 Net cash provided by operating activities, GAAP measure $ 1,881 $ 2,340 Capital spending (1,499) (1,305) Sales of property, plant and equipment 222 22 Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ 604 $ 1,057 We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable 51 Table of Contents interest rates. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2021 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information. Material Changes in Line Items in Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated statement of income are discussed in “Results of Operations – Division Review” and “Items Affecting Comparability.” Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows are discussed in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated balance sheet are discussed below: Total Assets As of June 11, 2022, total assets were $93.1 billion, compared to $92.4 billion as of December 25, 2021. The increase in total assets is primarily driven by the following line items: Change (a) Reference Accounts and notes receivable, less allowance $ 1.8 (b) Inventories $ 0.9 (c) Assets held for sale $ (1.8) (d) Other indefinite-lived intangible assets $ (1.4) Note 3 Investments in noncontrolled affiliates $ 0.9 Note 11 Total Liabilities As of June 11, 2022, total liabilities were $74.4 billion, compared to $76.2 billion as of December 25, 2021. The decrease in total liabilities is primarily driven by the following line items: Change (a) Reference Short-term debt obligations $ 1.7 (e) Liabilities held for sale $ (0.8) (d) Long-term debt obligations $ (2.8) Note 7 (a) In billions. (b) Reflects favorable operating performance. (c) Reflects seasonal build of inventory. (d) Reflects closing of the Juice Transaction. See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information. (e) Reflects changes primarily related to issuance of commercial paper. 52 Table of Contents Total Equity Refer to our condensed consolidated statement of equity, and Notes 6 and 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for material changes in equity line items. 53 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 11, 2022, the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income and Equity for the twelve and twenty-four weeks ended June 11, 2022 and June 12, 2021, the related Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the twenty-four weeks ended June 11, 2022 and June 12, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 25, 2021, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 9, 2022, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 25, 2021, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York July 11, 2022 54 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the 12 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses in phases over the next several years. In connection with these ERP implementations, we are updating and will continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. During the 12 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we continued implementing these systems, resulting in changes that materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with this multi-year productivity plan and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These business process changes have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Except with respect to the continued implementation of ERP systems, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the 12 weeks ended June 11, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting as we continue to implement our ERP solution and our 2019 multi-year productivity plan. 55 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. The following information should be read in conjunction with the discussion set forth under Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our 2021 Form 10-K. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See also “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2021 Form 10-K. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. The following additional risk factor should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2021 Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 19, 2022 (Q1 2022 Form 10-Q). The developments described below have heightened, or in some cases manifested, certain of the risks disclosed in the risk factor section of our 2021 Form 10-K, and such risk factors are further qualified by the information relating to our operations in Russia and Ukraine as described in this Form 10-Q and our Q1 2022 Form 10-Q, including in the additional risk factor below. You should carefully consider the risks described below and in our 2021 Form 10-K and Q1 2022 Form 10-Q in addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, our Q1 2022 Form 10-Q and in our 2021 Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. These risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance, which in turn can affect the price of our publicly traded securities. The risks described below and in our 2021 Form 10-K and Q1 2022 Form 10-Q are not the only risks we face. There may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but that may become material in the future. Therefore, historical operating results, financial and business performance, events and trends are often not a reliable indicator of future operating results, financial and business performance, events or trends. Risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine The deadly conflict in Ukraine has continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty and the majority of our operations in Ukraine remain suspended. We a re in the process of suspending sales of Pepsi-Cola and certain of our other global beverage brands and have suspended our discretionary capital investments and advertising and promotional activities in Russia. We plan to continue to offer our other products in Russia. The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risk, heightened risks to employee safety, significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging and raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in loss of assets or result in additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our operations, customers or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 25, 2021 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021 (2021 Form 10-K). This report should be read in conjunction with our 2021 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. While our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis. This change did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. For our international operations, the months of January and February are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the deadly conflict in Ukraine has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates. Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. Our Divisions We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada; 9 Table of Contents 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada; 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe; 6) Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region. Net revenue of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 FLNA $ 4,839 $ 4,236 QFNA 713 646 PBNA 5,353 5,074 LatAm 1,474 1,242 Europe 1,797 1,795 AMESA 1,004 883 APAC 1,020 944 Total $ 16,200 $ 14,820 Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products to our customers. The following tables reflect the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our convenient food business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue: 12 Weeks Ended 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 Beverages (a) Convenient Foods Beverages (a) Convenient Foods LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 50 % 50 % 50 % 50 % AMESA 30 % 70 % 30 % 70 % APAC 15 % 85 % 15 % 85 % PepsiCo (b) 40 % 60 % 45 % 55 % (a) Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe divisions, is approximately 35 % and 40 % of our consolidated net revenue in the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022 and March 20, 2021, respectively. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue but lower operating margin as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. (b) The decrease in the percentage of net revenue generated by our beverage business in the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022 primarily reflects the Juice Transaction. See Note 11 for further information. 10 Table of Contents Operating profit of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 FLNA $ 1,296 $ 1,240 QFNA 159 150 PBNA (a) 3,434 366 LatAm 323 218 Europe (a) (b) ( 136 ) 131 AMESA 180 138 APAC 215 208 Total divisions 5,471 2,451 Corporate unallocated expenses (c) ( 204 ) ( 139 ) Total $ 5,267 $ 2,312 (a) In the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we recorded a gain of $ 3.0 billion and $ 298 million in our PBNA and Europe divisions, respectively, associated with the Juice Transaction. The total after-tax amount was $ 2.9 billion or $ 2.06 per share. See Note 11 for further information. (b) In the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges (Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges) of $ 241 million ($ 193 million after-tax or $ 0.14 per share) in selling, general and administrative expenses related to the discontinuation or repositioning of certain juice and dairy brands in Russia. See Note 3 for further information. Also see below for charges taken as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. (c) In the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021, we recorded a pre-tax unrealized gain of $ 108 million ($ 82 million after-tax or $ 0.06 per share) on our short-term investment in a publicly traded company, based on the quoted active market price as of market close on March 19, 2021, the last trading day of our first quarter of 2021. The gain was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses within corporate unallocated expenses. We sold all of these shares during the second quarter of 2021. Operating profit includes certain pre-tax charges in our Europe division, taken as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. These pre-tax charges are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/19/2022 Impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment $ 123 Allowance for expected credit losses 37 Inventory write-downs 33 Other 48 Total (a) $ 241 After-tax amount $ 241 Impact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ ( 0.17 ) (a) Includes $ 140 million recorded in cost of sales and $ 101 million recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. 11 Table of Contents Operating profit includes certain pre-tax charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily related to incremental employee compensation costs, such as certain leave benefits and labor costs, and employee protection costs.

Note 2 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in 2021, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $ 2.4 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 10 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 35 % for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. The total expected plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 15 % 1 % 25 % 10 % 25 % 5 % 4 % 15 % A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 Cost of sales $ 5 $ 2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 22 35 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense — 6 Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 27 $ 43 After-tax amount $ 21 $ 35 Impact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ ( 0.02 ) $ ( 0.03 ) 12 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 through 3/19/2022 FLNA $ 3 $ 15 $ 167 QFNA — — 12 PBNA 3 4 161 LatAm 6 2 145 Europe 7 11 241 AMESA 2 1 72 APAC 1 — 62 Corporate 5 4 144 27 37 1,004 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense — 6 67 Total $ 27 $ 43 $ 1,071 12 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 through 3/19/2022 Severance and other employee costs $ 11 $ 34 $ 575 Asset impairments — — 157 Other costs 16 9 339 Total $ 27 $ 43 $ 1,071 Severance and other employee costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits, as well as voluntary separation arrangements.

Other Productivity Initiatives There were no charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives described above. For information on other impairment charges, see Notes 1 and 3 for Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges and Note 1 for Russia-Ukraine Conflict Charges. 13 Table of Contents Note 3 - Intangible Assets During the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we discontinued or repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. As a result, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges (Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges) of $ 241 million ($ 193 million after-tax or $ 0.14 per share) in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to indefinite-lived intangible assets. In light of the current political and economic environment, we will continue to review and analyze our brand portfolio worldwide. For further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K. A summary of our amortizable intangible assets is as follows: 3/19/2022 12/25/2021 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Acquired franchise rights (a) $ 975 $ ( 189 ) $ 786 $ 976 $ ( 187 ) $ 789 Customer relationships 608 ( 222 ) 386 623 ( 227 ) 396 Brands 1,120 ( 984 ) 136 1,151 ( 989 ) 162 Other identifiable intangibles 450 ( 261 ) 189 451 ( 260 ) 191 Total $ 3,153 $ ( 1,656 ) $ 1,497 $ 3,201 $ ( 1,663 ) $ 1,538 (a) Acquired franchise rights includes our distribution agreement with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with an expected residual value higher than our carrying value.

The assessment included both agreed and unagreed issues. On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals conference. As a result of the analysis of the 2014 through 2016 final assessment, we remeasured all applicable reserves for uncertain tax positions for all years open under the statute of limitations, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act), resulting in a net non-cash tax expense of $ 112 million in 2021. There were no tax amounts recognized in the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022 and March 20, 2021 from this assessment.

The components of net periodic benefit cost/(income) for pension and retiree medical plans are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 Service cost $ 114 $ 120 $ 17 $ 19 $ 8 $ 8 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income: Interest cost 88 75 17 13 4 3 Expected return on plan assets ( 215 ) ( 224 ) ( 42 ) ( 41 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) Amortization of prior service credits ( 6 ) ( 7 ) — — ( 2 ) ( 2 ) Amortization of net losses/(gains) 33 51 5 13 ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Settlement/curtailment gains — — — — ( 16 ) — Special termination benefits 6 6 — — — — Total other pension and retiree medical benefits income ( 94 ) ( 99 ) ( 20 ) ( 15 ) ( 20 ) ( 6 ) Total $ 20 $ 21 $ ( 3 ) $ 4 $ ( 12 ) $ 2 We regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. During the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022 and March 20, 2021, we made discretionary contributions of $ 75 million and $ 300 million, respectively, to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans, and $ 10 million and $ 25 million, respectively, to our international defined benefit plans. We expect to make an additional discretionary contribution of $ 75 million to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in the third quarter of 2022. Note 7 - Debt Obligations In the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, $ 1.3 billion of USD-denominated senior notes matured and were paid. Subsequent to March 19, 2022, we paid $ 750 million to redeem all $ 750 million outstanding principal amount of our 2.25 % senior notes due May 2022, and we gave notice to early redeem all $ 800 million outstanding principal amount of our 3.10 % senior notes due July 2022. As of March 19, 2022, we had $ 1.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding. Note 8 - Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. There have been no material changes during the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022 with respect to our risk management policies or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 17 Table of Contents 10-K. We continue to evaluate our hedging strategies related to our Russian business based on the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on financial markets. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of March 19, 2022 was $ 219 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of March 19, 2022. The notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of March 19, 2022 and December 25, 2021 are as follows: Notional Amounts (a) 3/19/2022 12/25/2021 Commodity $ 1.6 $ 1.6 Foreign exchange $ 2.6 $ 2.8 Interest rate $ 2.1 $ 2.1 Net investment (b) $ 2.1 $ 2.1 (a) In billions. (b) The total notional of our net investment hedge consists of non-derivative debt instruments. As of March 19, 2022, approximately 5 % of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to 2 % as of December 25, 2021. Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities Investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. Our held-to-maturity debt securities consist of commercial paper. As of March 19, 2022 and December 25, 2021, we had $ 244 million and $ 130 million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Our investments mature in less than one year. As of March 19, 2022 and December 25, 2021, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material. 18 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of March 19, 2022 and December 25, 2021 are categorized as follows: 3/19/2022 12/25/2021 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Index funds (b) 1 $ 297 $ — $ 337 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (c) 2 $ 20 $ — $ 21 $ — Deferred compensation (d) 2 $ — $ 480 $ — $ 505 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (e) 2 $ 43 $ 16 $ 29 $ 14 Interest rate (e) 2 28 275 14 264 Commodity (f) 2 119 1 70 5 $ 190 $ 292 $ 113 $ 283 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (e) 2 $ 39 $ 22 $ 19 $ 7 Commodity (f) 2 56 12 35 22 $ 95 $ 34 $ 54 $ 29 Total derivatives at fair value (g) $ 285 $ 326 $ 167 $ 312 Total $ 602 $ 806 $ 525 $ 817 (a) Fair value hierarchy levels are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) in both years. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities. (b) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (c) Based primarily on the price of our common stock. (d) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections. (e) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates. (f) Primarily based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements. (g) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of March 19, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of March 19, 2022 and December 25, 2021 was $ 38 billion and $ 43 billion, respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs. 19 Table of Contents Losses/(gains) on our hedging instruments are categorized as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Non- designated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Income Statement (a) Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (b) 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 Foreign exchange $ ( 16 ) $ 4 $ ( 8 ) $ 11 $ ( 4 ) $ 13 Interest rate — 1 ( 3 ) ( 18 ) 20 ( 4 ) Commodity ( 166 ) ( 81 ) ( 189 ) ( 90 ) ( 78 ) ( 10 ) Net investment — — ( 51 ) ( 63 ) — — Total $ ( 182 ) $ ( 76 ) $ ( 251 ) $ ( 160 ) $ ( 62 ) $ ( 1 ) (a) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. (b) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains on cross-currency interest rate swaps are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. Based on current market conditions, we expect to reclassify net gains of $ 275 million related to our cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income during the next 12 months.

(Pioneer Foods), Rockstar Energy Beverages (Rockstar) and Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. The purchase price allocations for each of these acquisitions were finalized in the second quarter of 2021. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information. Juice Transaction In the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for approximately $ 3.5 billion in cash and a 39 % noncontrolling interest in the Tropicana JV, operating across North America and Europe. The North America portion of the transaction was completed on January 24, 2022 and the Europe portion of the transaction was completed on February 1, 2022. In the U.S., PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for Tropicana JV’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. We have significant influence over our investment in the Tropicana JV and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our 22 Table of Contents proportionate share of Tropicana JV’s earnings within our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). As a result of this transaction, in the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 3.3 billion ($ 2.9 billion after-tax or $ 2.06 per share) in our PBNA and Europe divisions, including $ 520 million related to the remeasurement of our 39 % ownership in the Tropicana JV at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, discounted cash flows and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in the Tropicana JV. Subsequent to the transaction close date, the purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement. A summary of income statement activity related to the Juice Transaction in the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022 is as follows: PBNA Europe Corporate PepsiCo Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Impact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share Gain associated with the Juice Transaction $ ( 3,024 ) $ ( 298 ) $ — $ ( 3,322 ) $ 452 $ ( 2,870 ) $ 2.06 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges 37 10 3 50 ( 8 ) 42 ( 0.03 ) Operating profit $ ( 2,987 ) $ ( 288 ) $ 3 ( 3,272 ) 444 ( 2,828 ) 2.03 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income (b) ( 10 ) 3 ( 7 ) 0.01 Total Juice Transaction $ ( 3,282 ) $ 447 $ ( 2,835 ) $ 2.04 (a) Includes $ 194 million of deferred tax expense related to the recognition of our investment in the Tropicana JV. (b) Includes $ 16 million curtailment gain, partially offset by $ 6 million special termination benefits. In connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement with PAI Partners, under which we will provide certain services to the Tropicana JV to help facilitate an orderly transition of the business following the sale. In return for these services, the Tropicana JV is required to pay certain agreed upon fees to reimburse us for our costs without markup. Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Merger and integration charges include changes in fair value of contingent consideration, employee-related costs, contract termination costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees. 23 Table of Contents A summary of our acquisition and divestiture-related charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 Transaction FLNA $ — $ 2 BFY Brands, Inc.

FINANCIAL REVIEW Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies and estimates below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2021 Form 10-K. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes 24 Table of Contents in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Income Taxes In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur. Our Business Risks This Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine; the impact of COVID-19; future demand for PepsiCo’s products; damage to PepsiCo’s reputation or brand image; product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety; PepsiCo’s ability to compete effectively; PepsiCo’s ability to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce; water scarcity; changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer; disruption of PepsiCo’s manufacturing operations or supply chain, including increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs; political or social conditions in the markets where PepsiCo’s products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCo’s ability to grow its business in developing and emerging markets; changes in economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; future cyber incidents and other disruptions; failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions; PepsiCo’s reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems; climate change or measures to address climate change; strikes or work stoppages; failure to realize benefits from PepsiCo’s productivity initiatives; deterioration in estimates and underlying assumptions regarding future performance that can result in an impairment charge; fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCo’s credit ratings; imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo’s products; imposition of limitations on the marketing or sale of PepsiCo’s products; changes in laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials; failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities; failure to adequately protect PepsiCo’s intellectual property rights or infringement on intellectual property rights of others; failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; and potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other risks and uncertainties including those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 25 Table of Contents Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2021 Form 10-K and in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. COVID-19 Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous measures have been implemented around the world to try to reduce the spread of the virus and these measures have impacted and will continue to impact us, our business partners and our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic, including these measures, may continue to result in changes in demand for our products, increases in employee and other operating costs or supply chain disruptions, any of which can impact our ability to operate our business. In addition, we may continue to experience business disruptions resulting from the temporary closures of our facilities or facilities of our business partners or the inability of a significant portion of our or our business partners’ workforce to work because of illness, absenteeism, quarantine, vaccine mandates, or travel or other governmental restrictions. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain jurisdictions and markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, including changes in product and channel preferences that result in reduced sales or profit from the sale of our products. In addition, any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, which has resulted and may continue to result in our recording additional charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice, vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the possible emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, the availability, administration and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. During the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we continued to experience inflationary pressures on transportation and commodity costs, which we expect to continue for the remainder of 2022. A number of external factors, including the deadly conflict in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation and commodity costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. 26 Table of Contents See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices. Risks Associated with Climate Change Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. These new or increased legal or regulatory requirements could result in significant increased costs of compliance and additional investments in facilities and equipment. However, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations. Risks Associated with International Operations In the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January and February. In the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, our operations outside of the United States generated 37% of our consolidated net revenue, with Mexico, Canada, China, Russia, the United Kingdom and South Africa comprising approximately 20% of our consolidated net revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk in the international markets in whi ch our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 1 percentage point, primarily due to declines in the Turkish lira, euro, Russian ruble and Mexican peso. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, and natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely, including risks of impairments or write offs, and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of March 19, 2022 and December 25, 2021 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of these items. Risks Associated with the Deadly Conflict in Ukraine In addition to the risks associated with international operations discussed above, we continue to face risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine. The conflict has resulted in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty and led us to suspend the majority of our operations in Ukraine. We are in the process of suspending sales of Pepsi-Cola and certain of our other global beverage brands, our discretionary capital investments and advertising and promotional activities in Russia, which has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business. We continue to offer our other products in Russia. Our operations in Russia and Ukraine, respectively, accounted for 4% and 0.5% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 25, 2021 and 3% and 0.4% of our consolidated net revenue for both the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022 and the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021. Our assets 27 Table of Contents in Russia and Ukraine, respectively, were 5% and 0.3% of our consolidated assets as of December 25, 2021 and 4% and 0.1% of our consolidated assets as of March 19, 2022. The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risks, heightened risks to employee safety, significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets, including working capital facilities, increased operating costs (including fuel and other input costs), environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions and other regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in loss of assets or result in additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will affect our customers, operations or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business. The extent of the impact of these tragic events on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the conflict. We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in increased regulatory focus on labeling in certain jurisdictions, including in Mexico which enacted product labeling requirements and limitations on the marketing of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. We sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. Retail Landscape Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our 28 Table of Contents global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Cautionary statements included above and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” in our 2021 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. Results of Operations – Consolidated Review Consolidated Results Volume Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Financial Results – Volume” included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information on volume. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, unit volume growth adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. Further, unit volume growth will exclude the impact of an additional week of results every five or six years (53 rd reporting week), where applicable, including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We reported substantially all of our international volume on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis. The 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022 include volume outside of North America for the months of January and February. Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit 12 Weeks Ended 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 Change Net revenue $ 16,200 $ 14,820 9 % Operating profit $ 5,267 $ 2,312 128 % Operating margin 32.5 % 15.6 % 16.9 See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. Operating profit grew 128% and operating margin improved 16.9 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by a 144-percentage-point impact of the gain associated with the Juice Transaction, partially offset by the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges in Russia, each of which reduced operating profit growth by 10 percentage points. Operating profit growth was also driven by net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 29-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. A prior-year gain on an investment reduced operating profit growth by 5 percentage points. The operating margin improvement primarily reflects the impact of the gain associated with the Juice Transaction. 29 Table of Contents Juice Transaction In the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in the Tropicana JV, operating across North America and Europe. These juice businesses delivered approximately $3 billion in net revenue in 2021. In the U.S., PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for Tropicana JV’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Results of Operations – Division Review While our financial results in North America are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis. This change did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. For our international operations, the months of January and February are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022. In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. See “Our Business Risks,” “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with GAAP. Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

In certain instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume growth disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between bottler case sales and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE). We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue. 30 Table of Contents Operating Profit, Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis Operating profit adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit growth adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures.

(b) Amounts may not sum due to rounding. FLNA Net revenue grew 14%, driven by effective net pricing and organic volume growth. Unit volume grew 1%, primarily reflecting high-single-digit growth in variety packs and mid-single-digit growth in trademark Lay’s, partially offset by a double-digit decline in our Sabra joint venture products. Operating profit increased 4.5%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives and incremental transportation costs, and a 13-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil and packaging material. QFNA Net revenue grew 11%, driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decrease in organic volume. Unit volume declined 1.5%, primarily reflecting a double-digit decline in pancake syrups and mixes, a low-single-digit decline in oatmeal and a mid-single-digit decline in ready-to-eat cereals, partially offset by double-digit growth in rice/pasta sides and trademark Gamesa. Operating profit grew 6%, primarily reflecting the effective net pricing and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, a 13-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily oats, and a 3-percentage-point impact of less favorable settlements of promotional spending accruals compared to the prior year. PBNA Net revenue increased 5.5%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and an increase in organic volume. The Juice Transaction reduced net revenue growth by 7 percentage points. Unit volume increased 3%, driven by a 7% increase in non-carbonated beverage (NCB) volume while carbonated soft drink volume was even. The NCB volume increase primarily reflected double-digit increases in Gatorade sports drinks and in our overall water portfolio and a high-single-digit increase in our energy portfolio. 32 Table of Contents Operating profit increased 839%, primarily reflecting a gain of $3.0 billion associated with the Juice Transaction, partially offset by related transaction costs of $37 million. Operating profit also grew due to the net revenue growth and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation and information technology costs, and a 49-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, including aluminum and resin. The loss of net revenue due to the Juice Transaction reduced operating profit growth by 16 percentage points. Additionally, less favorable settlements of promotional spending accruals compared to the prior year and unfavorable insurance adjustments reduced operating profit growth by 6 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively. LatAm Net revenue increased 19%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and organic volume growth, partially offset by a 3-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Convenient foods unit volume grew 4%, primarily reflecting mid-single-digit growth in Mexico and low-single-digit growth in Brazil. Beverage unit volume grew 7%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Argentina and Peru. Additionally, Mexico and Chile experienced mid-single-digit growth, Guatemala experienced low-single-digit growth and Brazil experienced high-single-digit growth. Operating profit increased 48%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by a 41-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil and packaging material, certain operating cost increases, a 3.5-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The recognition of certain indirect tax credits in Brazil and lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed 4.5 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit growth. Europe Net revenue was flat, reflecting effective net pricing, offset by an 8-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and a 2-percentage-point unfavorable impact of the Juice Transaction. Convenient foods unit volume grew 1%, primarily reflecting mid-single-digit growth in Turkey, the Netherlands and France and low-single-digit growth in the United Kingdom, partially offset by a double-digit decline in Poland and a low-single-digit decline in Russia. Beverage unit volume declined 1%, primarily reflecting double-digit declines in Germany and Turkey, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in Russia and the United Kingdom and high-single-digit growth in France. Operating profit decreased 204%, primarily reflecting the Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges in Russia and charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, each of which negatively impacted operating profit performance by 189 percentage points, partially offset by a 234-percentage-point impact of the gain associated with the Juice Transaction. Additionally, operating profit performance was negatively impacted by a 103-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily packaging material, raw milk and cooking oil, certain operating cost increases and a 17-percentage-point impact of payments to employees for a change in pension benefits. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing, productivity savings and lower advertising and marketing expenses. AMESA Net revenue increased 14%, primarily reflecting organic volume growth and effective net pricing. 33 Table of Contents Convenient foods unit volume grew 10%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in the Middle East and Pakistan. Additionally, South Africa experienced mid-single-digit growth and India experienced high-single-digit growth. Beverage unit volume grew 7%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Pakistan and high-single-digit growth in the Middle East and India, partially offset by a high-single-digit decline in Nigeria. Operating profit increased 30%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by a 38-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil and packaging material, and certain operating cost increases. APAC Net revenue increased 8%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and organic volume growth. Convenient foods unit volume declined 1%, primarily reflecting a low-single-digit decline in China, partially offset by double-digit growth in Thailand and mid-single-digit growth in Australia and Indonesia. Beverage unit volume grew 15%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in China and the Philippines. Additionally, Vietnam experienced low-single-digit growth and Thailand experienced double-digit growth. Operating profit increased 3%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses and an 8-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. Other Consolidated Results 12 Weeks Ended 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 Change Other pension and retiree medical benefits income $ 134 $ 120 $ 14 Net interest expense and other $ (240) $ (258) $ 18 Tax rate 17.2 % 20.7 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo (a) $ 4,261 $ 1,714 149 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted (a) $ 3.06 $ 1.24 148 % (a) For the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, the gain associated with the Juice Transaction contributed to both net income attributable to PepsiCo growth and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share growth. See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $14 million, primarily reflecting curtailment gains. Net interest expense and other decreased $18 million, primarily due to lower average debt balances, lower interest rates on average debt balances and higher interest rates on average cash balances. These impacts were partially offset by losses on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability as well as lower average cash balances. The reported tax rate decreased 3.5 percentage points, primarily reflecting the impact of the Juice Transaction, partially offset by valuation allowances recorded as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides 34 Table of Contents additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; costs associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts (including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses); charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, certain immaterial pension and retiree medical-related settlement and curtailment gains and losses were not considered items affecting comparability. Pension and retiree medical-related service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs will continue to be reflected in our core results. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q are discussed below: Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, gain associated with the Juice Transaction, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, provision for income taxes and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Productivity Plan, costs associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, the gain associated with the Juice Transaction, Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges, and the impact of settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, and where applicable, the impact of the 35 Table of Contents 53 rd reporting week, including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash used for operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-Q are impacted by the following items in each of the following periods: 12 Weeks Ended 3/19/2022 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Gain associated with the Juice Transaction Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 7,433 $ 8,767 $ 6,822 $ (3,322) $ 5,267 $ 134 $ 888 $ 4,261 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 33 (33) 79 — (112) — (26) (86) Restructuring and impairment charges (5) 5 (22) — 27 — 6 21 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (50) — 50 6 9 47 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction — — — 3,322 (3,322) — (452) (2,870) Russia-Ukraine conflict charges (140) 140 (101) — 241 — — 241 Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges — — (241) — 241 — 48 193 Pension and retiree medical-related impact — — — — — (16) (4) (12) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 7,321 $ 8,879 $ 6,487 $ — $ 2,392 $ 124 $ 469 $ 1,795 36 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended 3/20/2021 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 6,671 $ 8,149 $ 5,837 $ 2,312 $ 120 $ 451 $ 1,714 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 36 (36) 39 (75) — (17) (58) Restructuring and impairment charges (2) 2 (35) 37 6 8 35 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — 10 (10) — (3) (7) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 6,705 $ 8,115 $ 5,851 $ 2,264 $ 126 $ 439 $ 1,684 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. 12 Weeks Ended 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 Change Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, GAAP measure $ 3.06 $ 1.24 148 % Mark-to-market net impact (0.06) (0.04) Restructuring and impairment charges 0.02 0.03 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges 0.03 (0.01) Gain associated with the Juice Transaction (2.06) — Russia-Ukraine conflict charges 0.17 — Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges 0.14 — Pension and retiree medical-related impact (0.01) — Core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, non-GAAP measure $ 1.29 $ 1.21 (a) 6 % Impact of foreign exchange translation 1 Growth in core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP measure 7 % (a) Does not sum due to rounding. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the second quarter of 2021, we expanded and extended the program through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the 2019 Productivity Plan. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.4 billion. Plan to date through March 19, 2022, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.1 billion, including cash expenditures of $808 million. For the remainder of 2022, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $325 million, and cash expenditures of approximately $275 million. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax 37 Table of Contents charges and cash expenditures in our 2022 and 2023 financial results, with the balance to be incurred through 2026. Charges include severance and other employee costs, asset impairments and other costs. See Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K, for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Merger and integration charges include changes in fair value of contingent consideration, employee-related costs, contract termination costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees. See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Gain Associated with the Juice Transaction We recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PBNA and Europe divisions. See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Russia-Ukraine Conflict Charges In connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs. See Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges We recognized asset impairment charges as a result of management’s decision to discontinue or reposition certain brands. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact relates to curtailment gains resulting from the Juice Transaction. See Note 6 and Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion from the Juice Transaction, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See “Our Business Risks” and Note 7 and Note 11 to our condensed consolidated 38 Table of Contents financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the conflict. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the Russia-Ukraine conflict may have on our business and financial results. See “Our Business Risks,” Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-Q for further information related to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business and financial results. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by COVID-19 in the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business and financial results. See “Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results. As of March 19, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of March 19, 2022, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.9 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. See “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further discussion of the TCJ Act. As part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We were informed by the participating financial institutions that as of March 19, 2022 and December 25, 2021, $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers who participate in these 39 Table of Contents financing arrangements are outstanding. These supply chain finance arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. Operating Activities During the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, net cash used for operating activities was $0.2 billion, compared to net cash used for operating activities of $0.7 billion in the prior-year period. The increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions, as well as favorable operating profit performance and working capital comparisons. Investing Activities During the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, net cash provided by investing activities was $3.0 billion, primarily reflecting proceeds associated with the Juice Transaction of $3.5 billion, partially offset by net capital spending of $0.5 billion. We regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs. Financing Activities During the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, net cash used for financing activities was $1.8 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders, through dividend payments of $1.5 billion and share repurchases of $0.2 billion, and payments of long-term debt borrowings of $1.3 billion, partially offset by net proceeds of short-term borrowings of $1.2 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 10, 2022, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on February 11, 2022 and will expire on February 28, 2026. In addition, on February 10, 2022, we announced a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.60 per share from $4.30 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2022. We expect to return a total of approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2022, comprising dividends of approximately $6.2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion. Free Cash Flow The table below reconciles net cash used for operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 12 Weeks Ended 3/19/2022 3/20/2021 Net cash used for operating activities, GAAP measure $ (174) $ (719) Capital spending (522) (471) Sales of property, plant and equipment 3 5 Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ (693) $ (1,185) We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our 40 Table of Contents Business Risks,” included in our 2021 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information. Material Changes in Line Items in Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated statement of income are discussed in “Results of Operations – Division Review” and “Items Affecting Comparability.” Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows are discussed in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Material changes in line items in our condensed consolidated balance sheet are discussed below: Total Assets As of March 19, 2022, total assets were $93.0 billion, compared to $92.4 billion as of December 25, 2021. The increase in total assets is primarily driven by the following line items: Change (a) Reference Cash and cash equivalents $ 1.0 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Accounts and notes receivable, less allowance $ 0.7 (b) Assets held for sale $ (1.8) (c) Other indefinite-lived intangible assets $ (0.5) Note 3 Investments in noncontrolled affiliates $ 1.0 Note 11 Total Liabilities As of March 19, 2022, total liabilities were $74.6 billion, compared to $76.2 billion as of December 25, 2021. The decrease in total liabilities is primarily driven by the following line items: Change (a) Reference Short-term debt obligations $ 1.2 (d) Accounts payable and other current liabilities $ (0.8) (e) Liabilities held for sale $ (0.8) (c) Long-term debt obligations $ (1.4) Note 7 (a) In billions. (b) Reflects favorable operating performance. (c) Reflects closing of the Juice Transaction. See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Form 10-K for further information. (d) Reflects issuance of commercial paper. (e) Reflects payment of 2021 production payables across a number of our divisions. 41 Table of Contents Total Equity Refer to our condensed consolidated statement of equity for material changes in equity line items. 42 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of March 19, 2022, the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the twelve weeks ended March 19, 2022 and March 20, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 25, 2021, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 9, 2022, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 25, 2021, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York April 25, 2022 43 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2021 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses in phases over the next several years. In connection with these ERP implementations, we are updating and will continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. During the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we continued implementing these systems, resulting in changes that materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with this multi-year productivity plan and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These business process changes have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Except with respect to the continued implementation of ERP systems, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting as we continue to implement our ERP solution and our 2019 multi-year productivity plan. 44 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. The following information should be read in conjunction with the discussion set forth under Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our 2021 Form 10-K. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See also “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2021 Form 10-K. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. The following additional risk factor should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2021 Form 10-K. The developments described below have heightened, or in some cases manifested, certain of the risks disclosed in the risk factor section of our 2021 Form 10-K, and such risk factors are further qualified by the information relating to our operations in Russia and Ukraine as described in this Form 10-Q, including in the additional risk factor below. You should carefully consider the risks described below and in our 2021 Form 10-K in addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q and in our 2021 Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. These risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance, which in turn can affect the price of our publicly traded securities. The risks described below and in our 2021 Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. There may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but that may become material in the future. Therefore, historical operating results, financial and business performance, events and trends are often not a reliable indicator of future operating results, financial and business performance, events or trends. Risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine The deadly conflict in Ukraine has resulted in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty and led us to suspend the majority of our operations in Ukraine. We are in the process of suspending sales of Pepsi-Cola and certain of our other global beverage brands, our discretionary capital investments and advertising and promotional activities in Russia. We plan to continue to offer our other products in Russia. The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risk, heightened risks to employee safety, significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets, including working capital facilities, increased operating costs (including fuel and other input costs), environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions and other regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in loss of assets or result in additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will affect our operations, customers or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

See accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 8 Table of Contents Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 26, 2020 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020 (2020 Form 10-K). This report should be read in conjunction with our 2020 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. While our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of June, July and August are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended September 4, 2021 and the months of January through August are reflected in our results for the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The business and economic uncertainty resulting from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates. Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Our Divisions We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada; 9 Table of Contents 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe; 6) Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region.

The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting, (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction, (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment, including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate, and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. Note 3 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan to date, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. We now expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $ 2.4 billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately $ 2.5 billion, which included cash expenditures of approximately $ 1.6 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 65 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 10 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 25 % for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. The total expected plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 15 % 1 % 25 % 10 % 25 % 6 % 3 % 15 % A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 Cost of sales $ 9 $ 1 $ 13 $ 4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 42 59 110 112 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 1 1 6 8 Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 52 $ 61 $ 129 $ 124 After-tax amount $ 45 $ 48 $ 109 $ 101 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ ( 0.03 ) $ ( 0.03 ) $ ( 0.08 ) $ ( 0.07 ) 13 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 through 9/4/2021 FLNA $ 2 $ 2 $ 20 $ 9 $ 156 QFNA 1 — 1 1 13 PBNA 3 29 8 32 146 LatAm 14 5 22 14 124 Europe 20 13 46 29 199 AMESA 5 2 9 9 64 APAC 1 1 2 4 56 Corporate 5 8 15 18 105 51 60 123 116 863 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 1 1 6 8 63 Total $ 52 $ 61 $ 129 $ 124 $ 926 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 through 9/4/2021 Severance and other employee costs $ 28 $ 23 $ 77 $ 47 $ 521 Asset impairments 3 15 4 20 129 Other costs 21 23 48 57 276 Total $ 52 $ 61 $ 129 $ 124 $ 926 Severance and other employee costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits, as well as voluntary separation arrangements.

Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at September 4, 2021 is expected to be paid by the end of 2021. Other Productivity Initiatives There were no charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives described above. 14 Table of Contents Note 4 - Intangible Assets A summary of our amortizable intangible assets is as follows: 9/4/2021 12/26/2020 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Acquired franchise rights $ 981 $ ( 184 ) $ 797 $ 976 $ ( 173 ) $ 803 Customer relationships 638 ( 222 ) 416 642 ( 204 ) 438 Brands (a) 1,164 ( 992 ) 172 1,348 ( 1,099 ) 249 Other identifiable intangibles 456 ( 257 ) 199 474 ( 261 ) 213 Total $ 3,239 $ ( 1,655 ) $ 1,584 $ 3,440 $ ( 1,737 ) $ 1,703 (a) The change primarily reflects assets reclassified as held for sale in connection with our agreement to sell certain juice brands.

The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021, no income tax adjustments related to the TRAF were recorded. In the year ended December 26, 2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $ 72 million related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern. In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, we recorded net tax benefits of $ 77 million primarily related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern. While the accounting for the impacts of the TRAF are deemed to be complete, further adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures could be made in future quarters, including in connection with final tax return filings. For further information and discussion of the TRAF, refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. In the 12 weeks ended September 4, 2021, we received a final assessment from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016. The assessment included both agreed and unagreed issues. As a result of the analysis of the 2014 through 2016 final assessment, we have remeasured all applicable reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax expense of $ 112 million in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021.

For the 12 weeks ended September 4, 2021 and September 5, 2020, our grants of stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards were nominal. 17 Table of Contents Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: 36 Weeks Ended 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 Expected life 7 years 6 years Risk-free interest rate 1.1 % 0.9 % Expected volatility 14 % 14 % Expected dividend yield 3.1 % 3.4 % Note 7 - Pension and Retiree Medical Benefits In 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective December 31, 2025, to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants, which will decrease pre-tax pension benefits expense by approximately $ 70 million in 2021, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. In 2020, we also approved an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of certain participants from the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I and to a newly created plan, PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan H (Plan H), with no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense. In addition, in 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credits of certain participants in Plan H, which will increase pre-tax pension benefits expense by approximately $ 45 million in 2021, primarily impacting service cost expense. For further information on plan changes, refer to Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K.

We also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. In addition, lump sum payments may result in further settlement charges in future periods. During the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021, we made discretionary contributions of $ 500 million to our U.S. defined benefit qualified plans and $ 25 million to our international defined benefit plans. During the 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, we made discretionary contributions of $ 325 million to our U.S. defined benefit qualified plans and $ 14 million to our international defined benefit plans. Note 8 - Debt Obligations In the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021, $ 1.8 billion of USD-denominated senior notes and € 0.5 billion of euro-denominated senior notes matured and were paid. As of September 4, 2021, we had no commercial paper outstanding. In the second quarter of 2021, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement), which expires on May 28, 2026. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $ 0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.75 billion five year credit agreement, dated as of June 3, 2019. Also in the second quarter of 2021, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires on May 27, 2022. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of June 1, 2020. 19 Table of Contents Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of September 4, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement. Subsequent to September 4, 2021, we paid $ 750 million to redeem all $ 750 million outstanding principal amount of our 1.70 % senior notes due October 2021 and terminated the associated interest rate swap with a notional amount of $ 250 million. Note 9 - Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. There have been no material changes during the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021 with respect to our risk management policies or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of September 4, 2021 was $ 175 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of September 4, 2021. The notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of September 4, 2021 and December 26, 2020 are as follows: Notional Amounts (a) 9/4/2021 12/26/2020 Commodity $ 1.4 $ 1.1 Foreign exchange $ 2.3 $ 1.9 Interest rate $ 2.3 $ 3.0 Net investment (b) $ 2.7 $ 2.7 (a) In billions. (b) The total notional of our net investment hedge consists of non-derivative debt instruments. As of September 4, 2021, approximately 2 % of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to 3 % as of December 26, 2020. Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities Investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. Our held-to-maturity debt securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities and commercial paper. As of September 4, 2021, we had no investments in U.S. Treasury securities. As of December 26, 2020, we had $ 2.1 billion of investments in U.S. Treasury securities with $ 2.0 billion recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $ 0.1 billion in short-term investments. As of September 4, 2021, we had $ 258 million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. As 20 Table of Contents of December 26, 2020, we had $ 260 million of investments in commercial paper with $ 75 million recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $ 185 million in short-term investments. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Our investments mature in less than one year. As of September 4, 2021 and December 26, 2020, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material. Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of September 4, 2021 and December 26, 2020 are categorized as follows: 9/4/2021 12/26/2020 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Index funds (b) 1 $ 339 $ — $ 231 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (c) 2 $ 19 $ — $ 18 $ — Deferred compensation (d) 2 $ — $ 506 $ — $ 477 Contingent consideration (e) 3 $ — $ 840 $ — $ 861 Derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments: Interest rate (f) 2 $ — $ — $ 2 $ — Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 11 $ 25 $ 9 $ 71 Interest rate (g) 2 28 221 13 307 Commodity (h) 2 80 1 32 — $ 119 $ 247 $ 54 $ 378 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 5 $ 10 $ 4 $ 8 Commodity (h) 2 48 12 19 7 $ 53 $ 22 $ 23 $ 15 Total derivatives at fair value (i) $ 172 $ 269 $ 79 $ 393 Total $ 530 $ 1,615 $ 328 $ 1,731 (a) Fair value hierarchy levels are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in both years. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities. (b) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (c) Based primarily on the price of our common stock. (d) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections. (e) In connection with our acquisition of Rockstar, we recorded a liability for tax-related contingent consideration payable over up to 15 years, with an option to accelerate all remaining payments, with estimated maximum payments of approximately $ 1.1 billion, using current tax rates. The fair value of the liability is estimated using probability-weighted, discounted future cash flows at current tax rates. The significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used to estimate the fair value include the expected future tax benefits associated with the acquisition, the probability that the option to accelerate all remaining payments will be exercised and discount rates. These unobservable inputs did not materially differ from those used as of December 26, 2020. The expected annual future tax benefits range from approximately $ 40 million to $ 110 million, with an average of $ 70 million. The probability, in any given year, that the option to accelerate will be exercised ranges from 2 to 35 percent, with a weighted-average payment period of approximately 3 years. The discount rates range from less than 1 percent to 5 percent, with a weighted average of 4 percent. The contingent consideration measured at fair value using unobservable inputs as of September 4, 2021 is $ 840 million, comprised of an $ 861 million liability as of December 21 Table of Contents 26, 2020, a fair value decrease of $ 19 million in the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021, recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and a fair value decrease of $ 2 million in the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021, recorded in goodwill as a result of the finalization of purchase price allocation. (f) Based on London Interbank Offered Rate forward rates. The carrying amount of hedged fixed-rate debt was $ 0.2 billion as of September 4, 2021 and December 26, 2020, and is classified on our balance sheet within short-term debt obligations. As of September 4, 2021, fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt were not material. As of December 26, 2020, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt was a $ 2 million gain. As of September 4, 2021, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments on discontinued hedges was a $ 4 million net loss, which is being amortized over the remaining life of the related debt obligations. (g) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates. (h) Based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements. (i) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of September 4, 2021 and December 26, 2020 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value due to their short-term maturity. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our debt obligations as of September 4, 2021 and December 26, 2020 was $ 46 billion and $ 50 billion, respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs. Losses/(gains) on our hedging instruments are categorized as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Fair Value/Non- designated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Income Statement (a) Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (b) 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 Foreign exchange $ ( 5 ) $ ( 10 ) $ ( 18 ) $ 31 $ 27 $ ( 22 ) Interest rate 1 4 52 ( 117 ) 53 ( 102 ) Commodity ( 31 ) ( 37 ) 11 ( 29 ) ( 66 ) 24 Net investment — — ( 63 ) 118 — — Total $ ( 35 ) $ ( 43 ) $ ( 18 ) $ 3 $ 14 $ ( 100 ) 22 Table of Contents 36 Weeks Ended Fair Value/Non- designated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Income Statement (a) Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (b) 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 Foreign exchange $ 5 $ ( 11 ) $ 20 $ ( 47 ) $ 67 $ ( 37 ) Interest rate 2 ( 8 ) ( 12 ) ( 24 ) 2 ( 73 ) Commodity ( 182 ) 120 ( 235 ) 48 ( 109 ) 40 Net investment — — ( 71 ) 159 — — Total $ ( 175 ) $ 101 $ ( 298 ) $ 136 $ ( 40 ) $ ( 70 ) (a) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are primarily from fair value hedges and are included in net interest expense and other. These losses/gains are substantially offset by decreases/increases in the value of the underlying debt, which are also included in net interest expense and other. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. (b) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains on cross-currency interest rate swaps are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. Based on current market conditions, we expect to reclassify net gains of $ 166 million related to our cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income during the next 12 months.

The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 1.2 billion and was funded by two unsecured bridge loan facilities entered into by one of our international consolidated subsidiaries, which were fully repaid in April 2020. In connection with our acquisition of Pioneer Foods, we have made certain commitments to the South Africa Competition Commission, including a commitment to provide the equivalent of 7.8 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.4 billion as of the acquisition date, in value for the benefit of our employees, agricultural development, education, developing Pioneer Foods’ operations and enterprise development programs in South Africa. Included in this commitment is 2.3 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.1 billion, relating to the implementation of an employee ownership plan and an agricultural, entrepreneurship and educational development fund, which is an irrevocable condition of the acquisition. This commitment was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily in 26 Table of Contents the year ended December 26, 2020 and is expected to be settled primarily in the fourth quarter of 2021 or early 2022. The remaining commitment of 5.5 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.3 billion as of the acquisition date, relates to capital expenditures and/or business-related costs which will be incurred and recorded over a five-year period from the acquisition date. On April 24, 2020, we acquired Rockstar, an energy drink maker with whom we had a distribution agreement prior to the acquisition, for an upfront cash payment of approximately $ 3.85 billion and contingent consideration related to estimated future tax benefits associated with the acquisition of approximately $ 0.88 billion. See Note 9 for further information about the contingent consideration. On June 1, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Be & Cheery, one of the largest online snacks companies in China, from Haoxiangni Health Food Co., Ltd. for cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 0.7 billion. We accounted for the 2020 transactions as business combinations. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase price allocations for each of the 2020 acquisitions were finalized in the 12 weeks ended June 12, 2021. The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisitions of Pioneer Foods, Rockstar and Be & Cheery and the resulting goodwill as of the respective acquisition dates is summarized as follows: Pioneer Foods Rockstar Be & Cheery Acquisition date March 23, 2020 April 24, 2020 June 1, 2020 Inventories $ 229 $ 52 $ 45 Property, plant and equipment 379 8 60 Amortizable intangible assets 52 — 98 Nonamortizable intangible assets 183 2,400 309 Other assets and liabilities ( 53 ) ( 9 ) ( 24 ) Net deferred income taxes ( 117 ) — ( 99 ) Noncontrolling interest ( 5 ) — — Total identifiable net assets 668 2,451 389 Goodwill 558 2,278 309 Total purchase price $ 1,226 $ 4,729 $ 698 Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets recognized. The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Pioneer Foods primarily reflects synergies expected to arise from our combined brand portfolios and distribution networks, and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the AMESA segment. The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Rockstar primarily represents the value of PepsiCo’s expected new innovation in the energy category and is deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the PBNA segment. The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Be & Cheery primarily reflects growth opportunities for PepsiCo as we leverage Be & Cheery’s direct-to-consumer and supply chain capabilities and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the APAC segment. Juice Transaction On August 2, 2021, we entered into an agreement with PAI Partners to sell Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands across North America, and an irrevocable option to sell certain juice businesses in Europe, which will result in combined pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $ 3.3 billion while retaining 27 Table of Contents a 39 % noncontrolling interest in a newly formed joint venture (Juice Transaction). After the transaction closes, in the United States, PepsiCo will act as the exclusive distributor for the joint venture’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. The purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement. The financial statement impacts of the Juice Transaction will be recorded in the PBNA and Europe segments and in corporate unallocated expenses. We have reclassified $ 1.9 billion of assets, primarily accounts receivable, net, and inventories of $ 0.7 billion, goodwill and other intangible assets of $ 0.6 billion and property, plant and equipment of $ 0.5 billion, and liabilities of $ 0.8 billion, primarily accounts payable and other liabilities of $ 0.6 billion and deferred income taxes of $ 0.2 billion, related to the Juice Transaction as held for sale in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 4, 2021. The Juice Transaction is expected to close in late 2021 or early 2022, subject to customary conditions, including works council consultations and regulatory approvals. The Juice Transaction does not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL REVIEW Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. Our Critical Accounting Policies The critical accounting policies below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2020 Form 10-K. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Income Taxes In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur. Our Business Risks This Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act 29 Table of Contents are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions.

Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the impact of COVID-19; future demand for PepsiCo’s products; damage to PepsiCo’s reputation or brand image; issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety; PepsiCo’s ability to compete effectively; PepsiCo’s ability to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce; water scarcity; changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer; disruption of PepsiCo’s supply chain, including cost inflation in raw materials, packaging and commodities; political or social conditions in the markets where PepsiCo’s products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCo’s ability to grow its business in developing and emerging markets; changes in economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; future cyber incidents and other disruptions; failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions; PepsiCo’s reliance on third-party service providers; climate change or measures to address climate change; strikes or work stoppages; failure to realize benefits from PepsiCo’s productivity initiatives; deterioration in estimates and underlying assumptions regarding future performance that can result in an impairment charge; fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCo’s credit ratings; imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo’s products; imposition of limitations on the marketing or sale of PepsiCo’s products; changes in laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging of PepsiCo’s products; failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities; failure to adequately protect PepsiCo’s intellectual property rights or infringement on intellectual property rights of others; failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; and potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other risks and uncertainties including those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2020 Form 10-K and in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. COVID-19 Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to result in challenging operating environments and has affected almost all of the more than 200 countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, restrictions on public gatherings, shelter in place and safer-at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures continue in many of these markets. These measures have impacted and will continue to impact us, our customers (including foodservice customers), consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business, which may continue to result in changes in demand for our products, increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs, including expanded benefits and frontline incentives, costs associated with the provision of personal 30 Table of Contents protective equipment and increased sanitation, or otherwise), or adverse impacts to our supply chain through labor shortages, raw material shortages or reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, any of which can impact our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. In addition, measures that impact our ability to access our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or that impact the ability of our customers (including our foodservice customers), consumers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties to do the same, may continue to impact the availability or productivity of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely. Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact demand from consumers, including due to consumers not leaving their homes or leaving their homes less often than they did prior to the start of the pandemic or otherwise shopping for and consuming food and beverage products in a different manner than they historically have or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain of these jurisdictions and markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, spending levels and shopping and consumption preferences. Changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased demand for our products in subsequent quarters, or in a lower-margin sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from sales of our products. We continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences as markets move through varying stages of restrictions and re-opening at different times, including changes in at-home consumption, in immediate consumption and away-from-home channels, such as convenience and gas and foodservice. In addition, we continue to see an increase in demand in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels and any failure to capitalize on this demand could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow sales or category share and erode our competitive position. Any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty (including supply chain disruptions and labor shortages), can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products, reduced or canceled orders of our products, continued or additional closing of restaurants, stores, entertainment or sports complexes, schools or other venues in which our products are sold, or reduced capacity at any of the foregoing, or our business partners’ inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such adverse changes in our customers’ or business partners’ financial condition have also resulted and may continue to result in our recording additional charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice and vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. In addition, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, including the delta variant, the likelihood of a resurgence of positive cases, the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines, the speed at which such vaccines are administered, the efficacy of current vaccines against evolving strains or variants of the virus, global economic conditions during and 31 Table of Contents after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. During the 12 weeks ended September 4, 2021, we experienced higher than anticipated transportation and commodity costs, which we expect to continue for the remainder of 2021. A number of external factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation and commodity costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices. Risks Associated with International Operations In the 12 weeks ended September 4, 2021, substantially all of our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of June, July and August. In the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021, substantially all of our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January through August. In the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021, our operations outside of the United States generated 43% of our consolidated net revenue, with Mexico, Canada, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa comprising approximately 22% of our consolidated net revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk in the international markets in whi ch our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the 12 weeks ended September 4, 2021, favorable foreign exchange contributed 2 percentage points to net revenue growth, primarily due to appreciation in the Mexican peso, South African rand and Canadian dollar. In the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021, favorable foreign exchange contributed 2 percentage points to net revenue growth, primarily due to appreciation in the Mexican peso, Canadian dollar and euro. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey, and natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. We also continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), including the effects of the post-Brexit trade deal entered into between the United Kingdom and the European Union in December 2020, as well as the economic, operating and political environment in Russia and the potential impact for our Europe segment and other businesses. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of September 4, 2021 and December 26, 2020 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of these items. 32 Table of Contents Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in increased regulatory focus on labeling in certain jurisdictions, including in Mexico which enacted product labeling requirements and limitations on the marketing of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. Retail Landscape Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Cautionary statements included above and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” in our 2020 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. Results of Operations – Consolidated Review Consolidated Results Volume Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. Refer to 33 Table of Contents “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Financial Results – Volume” included in our 2020 Form 10-K for further information on volume. We report substantially all of our international volume on a monthly calendar basis. The 12 weeks ended September 4, 2021 include volume outside of North America for the months of June, July and August. The 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021 include volume outside of North America for the months of January through August. Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 Change 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 Change Net revenue $ 20,189 $ 18,091 12 % $ 54,226 $ 47,917 13 % Operating profit $ 3,159 $ 3,011 5 % $ 8,600 $ 7,254 19 % Operating margin 15.6 % 16.6 % (1.0) 15.9 % 15.1 % 0.8 See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. 12 Weeks Operating profit grew 5% and operating margin declined 1 percentage point. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 14-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. The operating margin decline primarily reflects higher commodity costs and certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs. Higher mark-to-market losses on commodity derivatives included in “Items Affecting Comparability” reduced operating profit growth by 3 percentage points. Additionally, lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the prior year contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit growth. 36 Weeks Operating profit grew 19% and operating margin improved 0.8 percentage point. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 10-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Lower acquisition and divestiture-related charges included in “Items Affecting Comparability” contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit growth. Additionally, lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the prior year contributed 7 percentage points to operating profit growth. Juice Transaction During the 12 weeks ended September 4, 2021, we entered into an agreement with PAI Partners to sell Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands across North America, and an irrevocable option to sell certain juice businesses in Europe, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in a newly formed joint venture. After the transaction closes, in the United States, PepsiCo will act as the exclusive distributor for the joint venture’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. This transaction is expected to close in late 2021 or early 2022, subject to customary conditions, including works council consultations and regulatory approvals. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. These juice businesses delivered approximately $3 billion in net revenue in 2020. 34 Table of Contents Results of Operations – Division Review While our financial results in North America are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of June, July and August are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended September 4, 2021 and the months of January through August are reflected in our results for the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021. In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. See “Our Business Risks,” “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with GAAP. Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

In certain instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume growth disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between bottler case sales and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE). Our net revenue excludes nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, is based on CSE. 35 Table of Contents Operating Profit, Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis Operating profit adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit growth adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures.

Unit volume grew 1%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in variety packs and high-single-digit growth in trademark Ruffles, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in trademark Lay’s and a mid-single-digit decline in trademark Tostitos. Operating profit increased slightly, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings, lower advertising and marketing expenses and a 3-percentage-point impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These impacts were largely offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives and incremental transportation costs, and a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily packaging material and cooking oil. 36 Weeks Net revenue grew 5.5%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and organic volume growth. Unit volume grew 1%, primarily reflecting the impact of our BFY Brands acquisition in the first quarter of 2020 and double-digit growth in variety packs, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in trademark Tostitos and a low-single-digit decline in trademark Lay’s. Operating profit increased 4%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 4- percentage-point impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives and incremental transportation costs, and a 3-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily packaging material and cooking oil. QFNA 12 Weeks Net revenue grew 2% and unit volume declined 4%. The net revenue growth primarily reflects effective net pricing, partially offset by a decrease in organic volume. The unit volume decline was primarily driven by a double-digit decline in pancake syrup and mix, a high-single-digit decline in ready-to-eat cereals and a low-single-digit decline in oatmeal, partially offset by growth in Cheetos macaroni and cheese, which was introduced in the third quarter of 2020. Operating profit declined 27%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, and a 10-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, partially offset by productivity savings and the effective net pricing. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a current-year decrease in consumer demand, which had a negative impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance compared to the significant COVID-19-related surge in demand in the prior year. 36 Weeks Net revenue declined 3.5% and unit volume declined 10%. The net revenue decline primarily reflects a decrease in organic volume, partially offset by effective net pricing. The unit volume decline was driven by double-digit declines in oatmeal, pancake syrup and mix, and ready-to-eat cereals, partially offset by the growth in Cheetos macaroni and cheese, which was introduced in the third quarter of 2020, and double-digit growth in lite snacks. 38 Table of Contents Operating profit declined 22%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, the net revenue performance and a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, partially offset by productivity savings. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a current-year decrease in consumer demand, which had a negative impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance compared to the significant COVID-19-related surge in demand in the prior year. PBNA 12 Weeks Net revenue increased 7%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and an increase in organic volume. Unit volume increased 3%, driven by a 3% increase in carbonated soft drink (CSD) volume and a 2% increase in non-carbonated beverage (NCB) volume. The NCB volume increase primarily reflected double-digit increases in our overall water portfolio and our energy portfolio, partially offset by a double-digit decrease in Gatorade sports drinks. Operating profit increased 11%, reflecting the net revenue growth, an 8-percentage-point impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, and a 13-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. Additionally, prior-year impairment charges associated with a coconut water brand contributed 5.5 percentage points to operating profit growth. 36 Weeks Net revenue increased 12%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and an increase in organic volume. Unit volume increased 5%, driven by a 4% increase in CSD volume and a 7% increase in NCB volume. The NCB volume increase primarily reflected double-digit increases in our overall water portfolio and our energy portfolio and a mid-single-digit increase in Lipton ready-to-drink teas. Operating profit increased 40%, reflecting the net revenue growth, a 21-percentage-point impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, an 11-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Higher prior-year acquisition and divestiture-related charges contributed 6 percentage points to operating profit growth. Additionally, favorable settlements of promotional spending accruals compared to the prior year, acquisitions, and the prior-year impairment charges associated with a coconut water brand each contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth. The recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a current-year increase in consumer demand, which had a positive impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance. LatAm 12 Weeks Net revenue increased 27%, reflecting effective net pricing, an 8-percentage-point impact of favorable foreign exchange and organic volume growth. Snacks unit volume grew 5%, primarily reflecting mid-single-digit growth in Mexico and Brazil. Beverage unit volume grew 9%, primarily reflecting double-digit-growth in Chile, Honduras and Argentina and high-single-digit growth in Guatemala. Additionally, Mexico experienced mid-single-digit growth and Brazil experienced low-single-digit growth. 39 Table of Contents Operating profit increased 57%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 13-percentage-point impact of favorable foreign exchange. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 31-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 7-percentage-point impact of an insurance settlement recovery in the prior year associated with a production facility fire in Mexico in 2018.

Net interest expense and other decreased $32 million, primarily due to lower average debt balances, lower rates on average debt balances and higher rates on average cash balances. These impacts were partially offset by lower gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability, as well as lower average cash balances. The reported tax rate increased 7.7 percentage points, primarily reflecting a remeasurement of all applicable reserves for uncertain tax positions as a result of the IRS audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016, including a 6-percentage-point impact from correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, as well as the prior-year impact of net tax benefits related to the TRAF. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 36 Weeks Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $117 million, primarily reflecting the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets, the impact of plan changes approved in 2020, as discussed in Note 7 in our condensed consolidated financial statements, and the impact of discretionary plan contributions, partially offset by a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets.

These impacts were partially offset by higher average debt balances, lower average cash balances and lower rates on average cash balances. The reported tax rate increased 2.2 percentage points, primarily reflecting a remeasurement of all applicable reserves for uncertain tax positions as a result of the IRS audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016, including a 2-percentage-point impact from correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, as well as the prior-year impact of net tax benefits related to the TRAF. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 43 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; costs associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; pension and retiree medical related items; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q are discussed below: Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, provision for income taxes and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Productivity Plan, costs associated with our acquisitions and divestitures and tax expense related to the TCJ Act (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance. 44 Table of Contents Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures, and where applicable, the impact of the 53rd reporting week. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact, in the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021, of an extra month of net revenue for our acquisitions of Pioneer Foods in our AMESA division and Be & Cheery in our APAC division as we aligned the reporting calendars of these acquisitions with those of our divisions, divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-Q are impacted by the following items in each of the following periods: 12 Weeks Ended 9/4/2021 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 9,394 $ 10,795 $ 7,636 $ 3,159 $ 118 $ 802 $ 2,224 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (15) 15 (19) 34 — 8 26 Restructuring and impairment charges (9) 9 (42) 51 1 7 45 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — 3 (3) — (1) (2) Tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — — (190) 190 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 9,370 $ 10,819 $ 7,578 $ 3,241 $ 119 $ 626 $ 2,483 45 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended 9/5/2020 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 8,156 $ 9,935 $ 6,924 $ 3,011 $ 86 $ 526 $ 2,291 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 38 (38) 33 (71) — (16) (55) Restructuring and impairment charges (1) 1 (59) 60 1 13 48 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges (11) 11 (32) 43 — 16 27 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 8,182 $ 9,909 $ 6,866 $ 3,043 $ 87 $ 539 $ 2,311 36 Weeks Ended 9/4/2021 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 24,945 $ 29,281 $ 20,681 $ 8,600 $ 364 $ 1,895 $ 6,296 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 21 (21) 40 (61) — (13) (48) Restructuring and impairment charges (13) 13 (110) 123 6 20 109 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges (1) 1 (11) 12 — — 12 Tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — — (190) 190 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 24,952 $ 29,274 $ 20,600 $ 8,674 $ 370 $ 1,712 $ 6,559 36 Weeks Ended 9/5/2020 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 21,371 $ 26,546 $ 19,292 $ 7,254 $ 247 $ 1,396 $ 5,275 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 14 (14) (40) 26 — 8 18 Restructuring and impairment charges (4) 4 (112) 116 8 23 101 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges (30) 30 (256) 286 — 32 254 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 21,351 $ 26,566 $ 18,884 $ 7,682 $ 255 $ 1,459 $ 5,648 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 Change 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 Change Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, GAAP measure $ 1.60 $ 1.65 (3) % $ 4.54 $ 3.79 20 % Mark-to-market net impact 0.02 (0.04) (0.03) 0.01 Restructuring and impairment charges 0.03 0.03 0.08 0.07 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — 0.02 0.01 0.18 Tax expense related to the TCJ Act 0.14 — 0.14 — Core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, non-GAAP measure $ 1.79 $ 1.66 8 % $ 4.73 (a) $ 4.05 17 % Impact of foreign exchange translation (2) (2) Growth in core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP measure 5.5 % (a) 15 % (a) Does not sum due to rounding. 46 Table of Contents Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan to date, we expanded and extended the program through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We now expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.4 billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, which included cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion. Plan to date through September 4, 2021, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $926 million, including cash expenditures of $685 million. For the remainder of 2021, we expect to incur pre-tax charges and cash expenditures of approximately $150 million. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2022 and 2023 financial results, with the balance to be incurred through 2026. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K, for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets, merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Merger and integration charges include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, closing costs, employee-related costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, contract termination costs and other integration costs. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Tax Expense Related to the TCJ Act Tax expense related to the TCJ Act reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of cash available to 47 Table of Contents fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated dividend payments, debt repayments, payments for acquisitions, including the contingent consideration related to Rockstar, and the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, cash and cash equivalents, and expected pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $3.3 billion from the Juice Transaction, which is expected to close in late 2021 or early 2022. We expect to use the proceeds from the Juice Transaction primarily to strengthen our balance sheet and to make organic investments in the business. See “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 and Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2020 Form 10-K for further information. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by COVID-19 in the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business and financial results. See “Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2020 Form 10-K for further information related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results. As of September 4, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of September 4, 2021, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.9 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. See “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2020 Form 10-K for further discussion of the TCJ Act. As of September 4, 2021, we had $3.8 billion of non-cancelable purchasing commitments, reflecting an increase of $1.5 billion from December 26, 2020, primarily due to new purchasing contracts and the timing of entering into contract renewals. For further information on our long-term contractual commitments, see “Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our 2020 Form 10-K. As part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our 48 Table of Contents obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of September 4, 2021 and December 26, 2020, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers who participate in these financing arrangements are outstanding. These supply chain finance arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. Operating Activities During the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $6.6 billion, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $6.1 billion in the prior-year period. The increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects favorable operating profit performance, partially offset by higher tax payments related to the TCJ Act and higher pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year. Investing Activities During the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021, net cash used for investing activities was $1.0 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $2.2 billion, partially offset by maturities of short-term investments with maturities of greater than three months of $1.1 billion. We regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs. Financing Activities During the 36 weeks ended September 4, 2021, net cash used for financing activities was $7.2 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividend payments of $4.3 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $2.5 billion and payments of short-term borrowings of $0.4 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and expired on June 30, 2021. In addition, on February 11, 2021, we announced a 5% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.30 per share from $4.09 per share, effective with the dividend paid in June 2021. We expect to return a total of approximately $5.9 billion to shareholders in 2021, comprised of dividends of approximately $5.8 billion and share repurchases of $106 million. We completed our share repurchase activity during the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021 and do not expect to repurchase any additional shares for the balance of 2021. 49 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 36 Weeks Ended 9/4/2021 9/5/2020 Net cash provided by operating activities, GAAP measure $ 6,634 $ 6,123 Capital spending (2,276) (2,074) Sales of property, plant and equipment 40 26 Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ 4,398 $ 4,075 We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2020 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2020 Form 10-K for further information. 50 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 4, 2021, the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income and Equity for the twelve and thirty-six weeks ended September 4, 2021 and September 5, 2020, the related Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the thirty-six weeks ended September 4, 2021 and September 5, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 26, 2020, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 10, 2021, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 26, 2020, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York October 4, 2021 51 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the 12 weeks ended September 4, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During the 12 weeks ended September 4, 2021, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. In addition, in connection with our 2019 Productivity Plan, we continue to migrate to shared business service models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These transitions have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 52 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.

See accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 8 Table of Contents Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 26, 2020 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020 (2020 Form 10-K). This report should be read in conjunction with our 2020 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. While our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of March, April and May are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended June 12, 2021 and the months of January through May are reflected in our results for the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The business and economic uncertainty resulting from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates. Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. Our Divisions We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada; 9 Table of Contents 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe; 6) Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region. Net revenue of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 FLNA $ 4,552 $ 4,273 $ 8,788 $ 8,347 QFNA 575 664 1,221 1,298 PBNA 6,156 4,970 11,230 9,808 LatAm 1,967 1,567 3,209 2,877 Europe 3,286 2,725 5,081 4,564 AMESA (a) 1,602 983 2,485 1,614 APAC (b) 1,079 763 2,023 1,318 Total $ 19,217 $ 15,945 $ 34,037 $ 29,826 (a) The increase primarily reflects our acquisition of Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (Pioneer Foods). See Note 12 for further information. (b) The increase primarily reflects our acquisition of Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. (Be & Cheery). See Note 12 for further information. Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and food and snack products to our customers. The following tables reflect the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our food and snack business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue: 12 Weeks Ended 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 Beverage (a) Food/Snack Beverage (a) Food/Snack LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 55 % 45 % 50 % 50 % AMESA 35 % 65 % 40 % 60 % APAC 25 % 75 % 25 % 75 % PepsiCo 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % 10 Table of Contents 24 Weeks Ended 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 Beverage (a) Food/Snack Beverage (a) Food/Snack LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 55 % 45 % 55 % 45 % AMESA 30 % 70 % 35 % 65 % APAC 20 % 80 % 25 % 75 % PepsiCo 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % (a) Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe segments, is approximately 40 % of our consolidated net revenue in each of the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021 and June 13, 2020. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue but lower operating margin as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. Operating profit of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 FLNA $ 1,382 $ 1,278 $ 2,622 $ 2,480 QFNA 128 196 278 346 PBNA 809 397 1,175 694 LatAm 356 219 574 450 Europe 405 351 536 497 AMESA 256 59 394 193 APAC 192 189 400 331 Total divisions 3,528 2,689 5,979 4,991 Corporate unallocated expenses (a) ( 399 ) ( 370 ) ( 538 ) ( 748 ) Total $ 3,129 $ 2,319 $ 5,441 $ 4,243 (a) In the 12 weeks ended June 12, 2021, we sold our short-term investment in a publicly traded company and recorded a pre-tax loss on the sale of $ 39 million ($ 30 million after-tax or $ 0.02 per share), net of discounts, in selling, general and administrative expenses. The 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021 include a pre-tax net gain of $ 69 million ($ 52 million after-tax or $ 0.04 per share) associated with this sale. Operating profit includes certain pre-tax charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Income amounts represent reductions in the previously recorded reserves due to improved projected default rates and lower at-risk receivable balances. (b) Relates to promotional spending for which benefit is not expected to be received. Income amounts represent reductions in previously recorded reserves due to improved projected default rates and lower overall advance balances. (c) Includes incremental frontline incentive pay, crisis child care and other leave benefits and labor costs. (d) Includes costs associated with personal protective equipment, temperature scans, cleaning and other sanitization services. (e) Includes reserves for property, plant and equipment, donations of cash and product and other costs. Income amounts represent adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.

Income amount represents a true-up of inventory reserves. 12 Table of Contents Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting, (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction, (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment, including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate, and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. Note 3 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan to date, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. We now expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $ 2.4 billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately $ 2.5 billion, which included cash expenditures of approximately $ 1.6 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 65 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 10 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 25 % for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives.

The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $ 72 million related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern. There were no income tax adjustments related to the TRAF recorded in either of the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021 or June 13, 2020. While the accounting for the impacts of the TRAF are deemed to be complete, further adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures could be made in future quarters, including in connection with final tax return filings. For further information and discussion of the TRAF, refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. Subsequent to June 12, 2021, we received a final assessment from the IRS related to the audits of 2014 through 2016. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such assessments and believe that our current reserves are adequate. Note 6 - Share-Based Compensation The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling and general and administrative expenses: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 Share-based compensation expense – equity awards $ 65 $ 40 $ 144 $ 101 Share-based compensation expense – liability awards — 4 4 7 Restructuring charges — ( 1 ) 1 — Total $ 65 $ 43 $ 149 $ 108 The following table summarizes share-based awards granted under the terms of the PepsiCo, Inc.

We granted long-term cash awards to certain executive officers and other senior executives with an aggregate target value of $ 17 million and $ 18 million during the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021 and June 13, 2020, respectively. For the 12 weeks ended June 12, 2021 and June 13, 2020, our grants of stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards were nominal. 17 Table of Contents Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: 24 Weeks Ended 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 Expected life 7 years 6 years Risk-free interest rate 1.1 % 1.0 % Expected volatility 14 % 14 % Expected dividend yield 3.1 % 3.5 % Note 7 - Pension and Retiree Medical Benefits In 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective December 31, 2025, to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants, which will decrease pre-tax pension benefits expense by approximately $ 70 million in 2021, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. In 2020, we also approved an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of certain participants from the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I and to a newly created plan, PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan H (Plan H), with no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense. In addition, in 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credits of certain participants in Plan H, which will increase pre-tax pension benefits expense by approximately $ 45 million in 2021, primarily impacting service cost expense. For further information on plan changes, refer to Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K.

We also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. During the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021, we made discretionary contributions of $ 300 million to Plan H in the United States and $ 25 million to our international plans. We expect to make an additional discretionary contribution of $ 200 million to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in the third quarter of 2021. During the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020, we made discretionary contributions of $ 150 million to Plan A in the United States and $ 14 million to our international plans. Note 8 - Debt Obligations In the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021, $ 1.0 billion of USD-denominated senior notes and € 0.5 billion of euro-denominated senior notes matured and were paid. As of June 12, 2021, we had no commercial paper outstanding. In the second quarter of 2021, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement), which expires on May 28, 2026. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $ 0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.75 billion five year credit agreement, dated as of June 3, 2019. Also in the second quarter of 2021, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires on May 27, 2022. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of June 1, 2020. 19 Table of Contents Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of June 12, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement. Note 9 - Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. There have been no material changes during the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021 with respect to our risk management policies or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of June 12, 2021 was $ 133 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of June 12, 2021. The notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of June 12, 2021 and December 26, 2020 are as follows: Notional Amounts (a) 6/12/2021 12/26/2020 Commodity $ 1.2 $ 1.1 Foreign exchange $ 2.3 $ 1.9 Interest rate $ 2.3 $ 3.0 Net investment (b) $ 2.7 $ 2.7 (a) In billions. (b) The total notional of our net investment hedge consists of non-derivative debt instruments. As of June 12, 2021, approximately 2 % of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to 3 % as of December 26, 2020. Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities Investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. Our held-to-maturity debt securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities and commercial paper. As of June 12, 2021, we had no investments in U.S. Treasury securities. As of December 26, 2020, we had $ 2.1 billion of investments in U.S. Treasury securities with $ 2.0 billion recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $ 0.1 billion in short-term investments. As of June 12, 2021, we had $ 85 million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. As of December 26, 2020, we had $ 260 million of investments in commercial paper with $ 75 million recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $ 185 million in short-term investments. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in 20 Table of Contents earnings. Our investments mature in less than one year. As of June 12, 2021 and December 26, 2020, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material. Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of June 12, 2021 and December 26, 2020 are categorized as follows: 6/12/2021 12/26/2020 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Index funds (b) 1 $ 328 $ — $ 231 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (c) 2 $ 18 $ — $ 18 $ — Deferred compensation (d) 2 $ — $ 500 $ — $ 477 Contingent consideration (e) 3 $ — $ 853 $ — $ 861 Derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments: Interest rate (f) 2 $ 1 $ — $ 2 $ — Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 4 $ 62 $ 9 $ 71 Interest rate (g) 2 49 191 13 307 Commodity (h) 2 69 1 32 — $ 122 $ 254 $ 54 $ 378 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 5 $ 14 $ 4 $ 8 Commodity (h) 2 45 15 19 7 $ 50 $ 29 $ 23 $ 15 Total derivatives at fair value (i) $ 173 $ 283 $ 79 $ 393 Total $ 519 $ 1,636 $ 328 $ 1,731 (a) Fair value hierarchy levels are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in both years. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities. (b) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (c) Based primarily on the price of our common stock. (d) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections. (e) In connection with our acquisition of Rockstar, we recorded a liability for tax-related contingent consideration payable over up to 15 years, with an option to accelerate all remaining payments, with estimated maximum payments of approximately $ 1.1 billion, using current tax rates. The fair value of the liability is estimated using probability-weighted, discounted future cash flows at current tax rates. The significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used to estimate the fair value include the expected future tax benefits associated with the acquisition, the probability that the option to accelerate all remaining payments will be exercised and discount rates. These unobservable inputs did not materially differ from those used as of December 26, 2020. The expected annual future tax benefits range from approximately $ 40 million to $ 110 million, with an average of $ 70 million. The probability, in any given year, that the option to accelerate will be exercised ranges from 3 to 25 percent, with a weighted-average payment period of approximately 3 years. The discount rates range from less than 1 percent to 5 percent, with a weighted average of 3 percent. The contingent consideration measured at fair value using unobservable inputs as of June 12, 2021 is $ 853 million, comprised of an $ 861 million liability as of December 26, 2020, a fair value decrease of $ 6 million in the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021, recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and a fair value decrease of $ 2 million in the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021, recorded in goodwill as a result of the finalization of purchase price allocation. (f) Based on London Interbank Offered Rate forward rates. The carrying amount of hedged fixed-rate debt was $ 0.2 billion as of June 12, 2021 and December 26, 2020 and is classified on our balance sheet within short-term debt obligations. As of June 12, 2021 and 21 Table of Contents December 26, 2020, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt was a $ 1 million gain and a $ 2 million gain, respectively. As of June 12, 2021, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments on discontinued hedges was a $ 9 million net loss, which is being amortized over the remaining life of the related debt obligations. (g) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates. (h) Based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements. (i) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of June 12, 2021 and December 26, 2020 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value due to their short-term maturity. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our debt obligations as of June 12, 2021 and December 26, 2020 was $ 46 billion and $ 50 billion, respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs. Losses/(gains) on our hedging instruments are categorized as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Fair Value/Non- designated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Income Statement (a) Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (b) 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 Foreign exchange $ 6 $ 10 $ 27 $ ( 27 ) $ 27 $ ( 19 ) Interest rate — ( 1 ) ( 46 ) ( 130 ) ( 47 ) ( 121 ) Commodity ( 70 ) ( 9 ) ( 156 ) 13 ( 33 ) 13 Net investment — — 55 125 — — Total $ ( 64 ) $ — $ ( 120 ) $ ( 19 ) $ ( 53 ) $ ( 127 ) 22 Table of Contents 24 Weeks Ended Fair Value/Non- designated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Income Statement (a) Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (b) 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 Foreign exchange $ 10 $ ( 1 ) $ 38 $ ( 78 ) $ 40 $ ( 15 ) Interest rate 1 ( 12 ) ( 64 ) 93 ( 51 ) 29 Commodity ( 151 ) 157 ( 246 ) 77 ( 43 ) 16 Net investment — — ( 8 ) 41 — — Total $ ( 140 ) $ 144 $ ( 280 ) $ 133 $ ( 54 ) $ 30 (a) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are primarily from fair value hedges and are included in net interest expense and other. These losses/gains are substantially offset by decreases/increases in the value of the underlying debt, which are also included in net interest expense and other. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. (b) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains on cross-currency interest rate swaps are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. Based on current market conditions, we expect to reclassify net gains of $ 188 million related to our cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income during the next 12 months.

The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 1.2 billion and was funded by two unsecured bridge loan facilities entered into by one of our international consolidated subsidiaries, which were fully repaid in April 2020. In connection with our acquisition of Pioneer Foods, we have made certain commitments to the South Africa Competition Commission, including a commitment to provide the equivalent of 7.8 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.4 billion as of the acquisition date, in value for the benefit of our employees, agricultural development, education, developing Pioneer Foods’ operations and enterprise development programs in South Africa. Included in this commitment is 2.3 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.1 billion, relating to the implementation of an employee ownership plan and an agricultural, entrepreneurship and educational development fund, which is an irrevocable condition of the acquisition. This commitment was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily in the year ended December 26, 2020 and is expected to be settled primarily in the second half of 2021. The remaining commitment of 5.5 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.3 billion as of the 25 Table of Contents acquisition date, relates to capital expenditures and/or business-related costs which will be incurred and recorded over a five-year period from the acquisition date. On April 24, 2020, we acquired Rockstar, an energy drink maker with whom we had a distribution agreement prior to the acquisition, for an upfront cash payment of approximately $ 3.85 billion and contingent consideration related to estimated future tax benefits associated with the acquisition of approximately $ 0.88 billion. See Note 9 for further information about the contingent consideration. On June 1, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Be & Cheery, one of the largest online snacks companies in China, from Haoxiangni Health Food Co., Ltd. for cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 0.7 billion. We accounted for the 2020 transactions as business combinations. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase price allocations for each of the 2020 acquisitions were finalized in the 12 weeks ended June 12, 2021. The following table summarizes the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisitions of Pioneer Foods, Rockstar and Be & Cheery and the resulting goodwill as of the respective acquisition dates. Pioneer Foods Rockstar Be & Cheery Acquisition date March 23, 2020 April 24, 2020 June 1, 2020 Inventories $ 229 $ 52 $ 45 Property, plant and equipment 379 8 60 Amortizable intangible assets 52 — 98 Nonamortizable intangible assets 183 2,400 309 Other assets and liabilities ( 53 ) ( 9 ) ( 24 ) Net deferred income taxes ( 117 ) — ( 99 ) Noncontrolling interest ( 5 ) — — Total identifiable net assets 668 2,451 389 Goodwill 558 2,278 309 Total purchase price $ 1,226 $ 4,729 $ 698 Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets recognized. The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Pioneer Foods primarily reflects synergies expected to arise from our combined brand portfolios and distribution networks, and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the AMESA segment. The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Rockstar primarily represents the value of PepsiCo’s expected new innovation in the energy category and is deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the PBNA segment. The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Be & Cheery primarily reflects growth opportunities for PepsiCo as we leverage Be & Cheery’s direct-to-consumer and supply chain capabilities and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the APAC segment. 26 Table of Contents Inventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges A summary of our inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 Cost of sales $ 1 $ 19 $ 1 $ 19 Selling, general and administrative expenses 24 199 14 224 Total $ 25 $ 218 $ 15 $ 243 After-tax amount $ 21 $ 205 $ 14 $ 227 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ ( 0.02 ) $ ( 0.15 ) $ ( 0.01 ) $ ( 0.16 ) Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges primarily include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets (recorded in cost of sales), merger and integration charges and other transaction-related costs (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses).

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL REVIEW Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. Our Critical Accounting Policies The critical accounting policies below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2020 Form 10-K. 27 Table of Contents Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Income Taxes In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur. Our Business Risks This Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the impact of COVID-19; future demand for PepsiCo’s products; damage to PepsiCo’s reputation or brand image; issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety; PepsiCo’s ability to compete effectively; PepsiCo’s ability to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce; water scarcity; changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer; disruption of PepsiCo’s 28 Table of Contents supply chain; political or social conditions in the markets where PepsiCo’s products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCo’s ability to grow its business in developing and emerging markets; changes in economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; future cyber incidents and other disruptions; failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions; PepsiCo’s reliance on third-party service providers; climate change or measures to address climate change; strikes or work stoppages; failure to realize benefits from PepsiCo’s productivity initiatives; deterioration in estimates and underlying assumptions regarding future performance that can result in an impairment charge; fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCo’s credit ratings; imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo’s products; imposition of limitations on the marketing or sale of PepsiCo’s products; changes in laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging of PepsiCo’s products; failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities; failure to adequately protect PepsiCo’s intellectual property rights or infringement on intellectual property rights of others; failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; and potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other risks and uncertainties including those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2020 Form 10-K and in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. COVID-19 Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to result in challenging operating environments and has affected almost all of the more than 200 countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, restrictions on public gatherings, shelter in place and safer-at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures continue in many of these markets. These measures have impacted and will continue to impact us, our customers (including foodservice customers), consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business, which may result in changes in demand for our products, increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs, including expanded benefits and frontline incentives, costs associated with the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, or otherwise), or adverse impacts to our supply chain through reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, any of which can impact our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. In addition, measures that impact our ability to access our offices (several of which remain closed), plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or that impact the ability of our customers (including our foodservice customers), consumers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties to do the same, may continue to impact the availability or productivity of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely. Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact demand from consumers, including due to consumers not leaving their homes or leaving their homes less often than they did prior to the start of the pandemic or otherwise shopping for and consuming food and beverage products in a different manner than they historically have or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies 29 Table of Contents gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain of these jurisdictions and markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, spending levels and shopping and consumption preferences. Changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased demand for our products in subsequent quarters, or in a lower-margin sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from sales of our products. We continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences as markets move through varying stages of restrictions and re-opening at different times, including changes in at-home consumption, in immediate consumption and away-from-home channels, such as convenience and gas and foodservice. In addition, we continue to see an increase in demand in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels and any failure to capitalize on this demand could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow sales or category share and erode our competitive position. Any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products, reduced or canceled orders of our products, continued or additional closing of restaurants, stores, entertainment or sports complexes, schools or other venues in which our products are sold, or reduced capacity at any of the foregoing, or our business partners’ inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such adverse changes in our customers’ or business partners’ financial condition have also resulted and may continue to result in our recording additional charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice and vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. In addition, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants of the virus, the likelihood of a resurgence of positive cases, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the speed at which such vaccines are administered, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. Risks Associated with International Operations In the 12 weeks ended June 12, 2021, substantially all of our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of March, April and May. In the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021, substantially all of our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January through May. In the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021, our operations outside of the United States generated 42% of our consolidated net revenue, with Mexico, Canada, Russia, China, South Africa and the United Kingdom comprising approximately 22% of our consolidated net revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021, favorable foreign exchange contributed 3 percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively, to net revenue growth, primarily due to appreciation in the euro, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. 30 Table of Contents In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey, and natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. We also continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), including the effects of the post-Brexit trade deal entered into between the United Kingdom and the European Union in December 2020, as well as the economic, operating and political environment in Russia and the potential impact for our Europe segment and other businesses. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of June 12, 2021 and December 26, 2020 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of these items. Cautionary statements included above and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” in our 2020 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in increased regulatory focus on labeling in certain jurisdictions, including in Mexico which recently enacted product labeling requirements and limitations on the marketing of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. 31 Table of Contents Retail Landscape Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Results of Operations – Consolidated Review Consolidated Results Volume Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Financial Results – Volume” included in our 2020 Form 10-K for further information on volume. We report substantially all of our international volume on a monthly calendar basis. The 12 weeks ended June 12, 2021 include volume outside of North America for the months of March, April and May. The 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021 include volume outside of North America for the months of January through May. Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 Change 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 Change Net revenue $ 19,217 $ 15,945 21 % $ 34,037 $ 29,826 14 % Operating profit $ 3,129 $ 2,319 35 % $ 5,441 $ 4,243 28 % Operating profit margin 16.3 % 14.5 % 1.8 16.0 % 14.2 % 1.8 See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. 12 Weeks Operating profit grew 35% and operating profit margin increased 1.8 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 3.5-percentage-point impact of favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 10-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Lower inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges included in “Items Affecting Comparability” contributed 11 percentage points to operating profit growth. Additionally, lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the prior year contributed 14 percentage points to operating profit growth. 32 Table of Contents 24 Weeks Operating profit grew 28% and operating profit margin increased 1.8 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, an 8-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Lower inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges and higher mark-to-market gains on commodity derivatives both included in “Items Affecting Comparability” contributed 6 percentage points and 5 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit growth. Additionally, lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the prior year contributed 9 percentage points to operating profit growth. Results of Operations – Division Review While our financial results in North America are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of March, April and May are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended June 12, 2021 and the months of January through May are reflected in our results for the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021. In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. See “Our Business Risks,” “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with GAAP. Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

In certain instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume growth disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between bottler case sales and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE). Our net revenue excludes nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, is based on CSE. Operating Profit, Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis Operating profit adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit growth adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures.

Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; costs associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; pension and retiree medical related items; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q are discussed below: Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, provision for income taxes and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges 43 Table of Contents related to our 2019 Productivity Plan and inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges associated with our acquisitions (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures, and where applicable, the impact of the 53rd reporting week. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of an extra month of net revenue in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021 as we aligned Pioneer Foods’ reporting calendar with that of our AMESA division, divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. 44 Table of Contents Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-Q are impacted by the following items in each of the following periods: 12 Weeks Ended 6/12/2021 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 8,880 $ 10,337 $ 7,208 $ 3,129 $ 126 $ 642 $ 2,358 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact — — 20 (20) — (4) (16) Restructuring and impairment charges (2) 2 (33) 35 (1) 5 29 Merger and integration charges (1) 1 (24) 25 — 4 21 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 8,877 $ 10,340 $ 7,171 $ 3,169 $ 125 $ 647 $ 2,392 12 Weeks Ended 6/13/2020 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 7,088 $ 8,857 $ 6,538 $ 2,319 $ 84 $ 510 $ 1,646 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 14 (14) 31 (45) — (11) (34) Restructuring and impairment charges (1) 1 (23) 24 1 4 21 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges (19) 19 (199) 218 — 13 205 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 7,082 $ 8,863 $ 6,347 $ 2,516 $ 85 $ 516 $ 1,838 24 Weeks Ended 6/12/2021 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 15,551 $ 18,486 $ 13,045 $ 5,441 $ 246 $ 1,093 $ 4,072 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 36 (36) 59 (95) — (21) (74) Restructuring and impairment charges (4) 4 (68) 72 5 13 64 Merger and integration charges (1) 1 (14) 15 — 1 14 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 15,582 $ 18,455 $ 13,022 $ 5,433 $ 251 $ 1,086 $ 4,076 24 Weeks Ended 6/13/2020 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 13,215 $ 16,611 $ 12,368 $ 4,243 $ 161 $ 870 $ 2,984 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (24) 24 (73) 97 — 24 73 Restructuring and impairment charges (3) 3 (53) 56 7 10 53 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges (19) 19 (224) 243 — 16 227 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 13,169 $ 16,657 $ 12,018 $ 4,639 $ 168 $ 920 $ 3,337 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. 45 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 Change 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 Change Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, GAAP measure $ 1.70 $ 1.18 44 % $ 2.94 $ 2.14 37 % Mark-to-market net impact (0.01) (0.02) (0.05) 0.05 Restructuring and impairment charges 0.02 0.02 0.05 0.04 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges 0.02 0.15 0.01 0.16 Core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, non-GAAP measure $ 1.72 (a) $ 1.32 (a) 31 % $ 2.94 (a) $ 2.39 23 % Impact of foreign exchange translation (4) (2) Growth in core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP measure 27 % 21 % (a) Does not sum due to rounding. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan to date, we expanded and extended the program through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We now expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.4 billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, which included cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion. Plan to date through June 12, 2021, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $874 million, including cash expenditures of $622 million. For the remainder of 2021, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $400 million, including cash expenditures of approximately $300 million, with the balance to be reflected in our 2022 through 2026 financial results. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2022 and 2023 results. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K, for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Inventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021, we recorded merger and integration charges related to our acquisitions of BFY Brands, Rockstar, Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery, as well as other transaction- 46 Table of Contents related costs. The merger and integration charges primarily include changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, employee-related costs and other integration costs. In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020, we recorded inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges related to our acquisitions of BFY Brands, Rockstar and Pioneer Foods. These charges primarily relate to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets, liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, closing costs, employee-related costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and contract termination costs. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated dividend payments, debt repayments, payments for acquisitions, including the contingent consideration related to Rockstar, and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. See “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2020 Form 10-K for further information. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by COVID-19 in the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business and financial results. See “Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2020 Form 10-K for further information related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results. As of June 12, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of June 12, 2021, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.9 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. See “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2020 Form 10-K for further discussion of the TCJ Act. As of June 12, 2021, we had $4.2 billion of non-cancelable purchasing commitments, reflecting an increase of $1.9 billion from December 26, 2020, primarily due to new purchasing contracts and the timing of entering into contract renewals. For further information on our long-term contractual commitments, see “Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our 2020 Form 10-K. 47 Table of Contents As part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of June 12, 2021 and December 26, 2020, $1.2 billion of our accounts payable to suppliers who participate in these financing arrangements are outstanding. These supply chain finance arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. Operating Activities During the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.3 billion, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1.5 billion in the prior-year period. The increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects favorable operating profit performance and working capital comparisons, partially offset by higher net cash tax payments and higher pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year. Investing Activities During the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021, net cash used for investing activities was $0.1 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $1.3 billion, largely offset by maturities of short-term investments with maturities of greater than three months of $1.1 billion. We regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs. Financing Activities During the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2021, net cash used for financing activities was $4.9 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividend payments of $2.8 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $1.7 billion and payments of short-term borrowings of $0.4 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and expired on June 30, 2021. In addition, on February 11, 2021, we announced a 5% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.30 per share from $4.09 per share, effective with the dividend paid in June 48 Table of Contents 2021. We expect to return a total of approximately $5.9 billion to shareholders in 2021, comprised of dividends of approximately $5.8 billion and share repurchases of $106 million. We completed our share repurchase activity during the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021 and do not expect to repurchase any additional shares for the balance of 2021. Free Cash Flow The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 24 Weeks Ended 6/12/2021 6/13/2020 Net cash provided by operating activities, GAAP measure $ 2,340 $ 1,462 Capital spending (1,305) (1,188) Sales of property, plant and equipment 22 18 Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ 1,057 $ 292 We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2020 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2020 Form 10-K for further information. 49 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 12, 2021, the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income and Equity for the twelve and twenty-four weeks ended June 12, 2021 and June 13, 2020, the related Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the twenty-four weeks ended June 12, 2021 and June 13, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 26, 2020, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 10, 2021, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 26, 2020, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York July 12, 2021 50 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the 12 weeks ended June 12, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During the 12 weeks ended June 12, 2021, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. In addition, in connection with our 2019 Productivity Plan, we continue to migrate to shared business service models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These transitions have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 51 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. The following information should be read in conjunction with the discussion set forth under Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our 2020 Form 10-K. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

See accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 8 Table of Contents Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 26, 2020 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020 (2020 Form 10-K). This report should be read in conjunction with our 2020 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. While our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of January and February are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The business and economic uncertainty resulting from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates. Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. Our Divisions We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada; 9 Table of Contents 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe; 6) Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region. Net revenue of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 FLNA $ 4,236 $ 4,074 QFNA 646 634 PBNA 5,074 4,838 LatAm 1,242 1,310 Europe 1,795 1,839 AMESA (a) 883 631 APAC (b) 944 555 Total $ 14,820 $ 13,881 (a) The increase primarily reflects our acquisition of Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (Pioneer Foods). See Note 12 for further information. (b) The increase primarily reflects our acquisition of Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. (Be & Cheery). See Note 12 for further information. Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and food and snack products to our customers. The following tables reflect the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our food and snack business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue: 12 Weeks Ended 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 Beverage (a) Food/Snack Beverage (a) Food/Snack LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 50 % 50 % 55 % 45 % AMESA 30 % 70 % 35 % 65 % APAC 15 % 85 % 20 % 80 % PepsiCo 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % (a) Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe segments, is approximately 40 % of our consolidated net revenue in both the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021 and March 21, 2020. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. 10 Table of Contents Operating profit of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 FLNA $ 1,240 $ 1,202 QFNA 150 150 PBNA 366 297 LatAm 218 231 Europe 131 146 AMESA 138 134 APAC 208 142 Total divisions $ 2,451 $ 2,302 Corporate unallocated expenses (a) ( 139 ) ( 378 ) Total $ 2,312 $ 1,924 (a) During the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021, we recorded a pre-tax unrealized gain of $ 108 million ($ 82 million after-tax or $ 0.06 per share) on our short-term investment in a publicly traded company, based on the quoted active market price as of market close on March 19, 2021, the last trading day of our first quarter of 2021. The gain was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses within corporate unallocated expenses. See Note 9 for further information. We subsequently sold all of these shares during the second quarter of 2021. We will record a related pre-tax loss of $ 39 million ($ 30 million after-tax), net of discounts, on the sale in our 12 weeks ending June 12, 2021 in selling, general and administrative expenses within corporate unallocated expenses. Operating profit includes certain pre-tax charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These pre-tax charges by division are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/20/2021 Allowances for Expected Credit Losses (a) Upfront Payments to Customers (b) Inventory Write-Downs and Product Returns Employee Compensation Expense (c) Employee Protection Costs (d) Other (e) Total FLNA (f) $ ( 4 ) $ — $ — $ 18 $ 9 $ 1 $ 24 QFNA — — — 1 1 — 2 PBNA (f) ( 4 ) 1 — 12 5 ( 1 ) 13 LatAm — — — 12 2 1 15 Europe — — — 3 3 — 6 AMESA (f) — — ( 2 ) — — 1 ( 1 ) APAC — — — — — 2 2 Total $ ( 8 ) $ 1 $ ( 2 ) $ 46 $ 20 $ 4 $ 61 12 Weeks Ended 3/21/2020 Allowances for Expected Credit Losses (a) Upfront Payments to Customers (b) Inventory Write-Downs and Product Returns (g) Other (e) Total FLNA $ 21 $ — $ 3 $ 3 $ 27 QFNA 2 — — — 2 PBNA 41 44 22 1 108 Europe 4 — — — 4 APAC — — 1 1 2 Total $ 68 $ 44 $ 26 $ 5 $ 143 (a) Reflects the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19, leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers, including foodservice and vending businesses.

(e) Includes reserves for property, plant and equipment, donations of cash and product and other costs. (f) Income amounts represent adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts. (g) Includes a reserve for product returns of $ 7 million. Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting, (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction, (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment, including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate, and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. Note 3 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. In connection with this plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 2.5 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $ 1.6 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 65 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 15 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 20 % for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. We expect to complete this plan by 2023. The total expected plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 15 % 1 % 30 % 10 % 25 % 5 % 3 % 11 % A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 Cost of sales $ 2 $ 2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 35 30 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 6 6 Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 43 $ 38 After-tax amount $ 35 $ 32 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ ( 0.03 ) $ ( 0.02 ) 12 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 through 3/20/2021 FLNA $ 15 $ 5 $ 151 QFNA — 1 12 PBNA 4 3 142 LatAm 2 5 104 Europe 11 8 164 AMESA 1 2 56 APAC — — 54 Corporate 4 8 94 37 32 777 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 6 6 63 Total $ 43 $ 38 $ 840 12 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 through 3/20/2021 Severance and other employee costs $ 34 $ 22 $ 478 Asset impairments — 1 125 Other costs 9 15 237 Total $ 43 $ 38 $ 840 Severance and other employee costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits, as well as voluntary separation arrangements. Other costs primarily include costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including contract termination costs, consulting and other professional fees. A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan activity for the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021 is as follows: Severance and Other Employee Costs Other Costs Total Liability as of December 26, 2020 $ 122 $ 5 $ 127 2021 restructuring charges 34 9 43 Cash payments ( 37 ) ( 12 ) ( 49 ) Non-cash charges and translation ( 6 ) 1 ( 5 ) Liability as of March 20, 2021 $ 113 $ 3 $ 116 Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at March 20, 2021 is expected to be paid by the end of 2021. Other Productivity Initiatives There were no charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives described above. 13 Table of Contents Note 4 - Intangible Assets A summary of our amortizable intangible assets is as follows: 3/20/2021 12/26/2020 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Acquired franchise rights $ 982 $ ( 177 ) $ 805 $ 976 $ ( 173 ) $ 803 Customer relationships 641 ( 209 ) 432 642 ( 204 ) 438 Brands 1,348 ( 1,104 ) 244 1,348 ( 1,099 ) 249 Other identifiable intangibles 473 ( 264 ) 209 474 ( 261 ) 213 Total $ 3,444 $ ( 1,754 ) $ 1,690 $ 3,440 $ ( 1,737 ) $ 1,703 14 Table of Contents The change in the book value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is as follows: Balance 12/26/2020 Acquisitions Translation and Other Balance 3/20/2021 FLNA (a) Goodwill $ 465 $ ( 8 ) $ 4 $ 461 Brands 340 — 1 341 Total 805 ( 8 ) 5 802 QFNA Goodwill 189 — — 189 Total 189 — — 189 PBNA Goodwill 12,189 — 15 12,204 Reacquired franchise rights 7,107 — 23 7,130 Acquired franchise rights 1,536 — 6 1,542 Brands 3,122 — — 3,122 Total 23,954 — 44 23,998 LatAm Goodwill 458 — ( 11 ) 447 Brands 108 — ( 5 ) 103 Total 566 — ( 16 ) 550 Europe Goodwill 3,806 — 7 3,813 Reacquired franchise rights 496 — ( 2 ) 494 Acquired franchise rights 172 — ( 2 ) 170 Brands 4,072 — ( 3 ) 4,069 Total 8,546 — — 8,546 AMESA Goodwill 1,096 — 6 1,102 Brands 214 — 3 217 Total 1,310 — 9 1,319 APAC Goodwill 554 — 9 563 Brands 445 — 8 453 Total 999 — 17 1,016 Total goodwill 18,757 ( 8 ) 30 18,779 Total reacquired franchise rights 7,603 — 21 7,624 Total acquired franchise rights 1,708 — 4 1,712 Total brands 8,301 — 4 8,305 Total $ 36,369 $ ( 8 ) $ 59 $ 36,420 (a) The change in acquisitions primarily reflects our acquisition of BFY Brands, Inc.

The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $ 72 million related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern. There were no income tax adjustments related to the TRAF recorded in either of the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021 or March 21, 2020. While the accounting for the impacts of the TRAF are deemed to be complete, further adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures could be made in future quarters, including in connection with final tax return filings. For further information and discussion of the TRAF, refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. Note 6 - Share-Based Compensation The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling and general and administrative expenses: 12 Weeks Ended 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 Share-based compensation expense - equity awards $ 79 $ 61 Share-based compensation expense - liability awards 4 3 Restructuring charges 1 1 Total $ 84 $ 65 The following table summarizes share-based awards granted under the terms of the PepsiCo, Inc.

We granted long-term cash awards to certain executive officers and other senior executives with an aggregate target value of $ 17 million and $ 18 million during the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021 and March 21, 2020, respectively. Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 Expected life 7 years 6 years Risk-free interest rate 1.1 % 1.0 % Expected volatility 14 % 14 % Expected dividend yield 3.1 % 3.5 % 16 Table of Contents Note 7 - Pension and Retiree Medical Benefits In 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective December 31, 2025, to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants, which will decrease pre-tax pension benefits expense by approximately $ 70 million in 2021, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. In 2020, we also approved an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of certain participants from the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I and to a newly created plan, PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan H (Plan H), with no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense. In addition, in 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credits of certain participants in Plan H, which will increase pre-tax pension benefits expense by approximately $ 45 million in 2021, primarily impacting service cost expense. For further information on plan changes, refer to Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. The components of net periodic benefit cost/(income) for pension and retiree medical plans are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 Service cost $ 120 $ 100 $ 19 $ 17 $ 8 $ 6 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income: Interest cost 75 100 13 16 3 6 Expected return on plan assets ( 224 ) ( 214 ) ( 41 ) ( 37 ) ( 4 ) ( 4 ) Amortization of prior service (credits)/cost ( 7 ) 3 — — ( 2 ) ( 3 ) Amortization of net losses/(gains) 51 45 13 10 ( 3 ) ( 5 ) Special termination benefits 6 6 — — — — Total other pension and retiree medical benefits income ( 99 ) ( 60 ) ( 15 ) ( 11 ) ( 6 ) ( 6 ) Total $ 21 $ 40 $ 4 $ 6 $ 2 $ — We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic conditions and uncertainty on the net unfunded status of our pension and retiree medical plans. We also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. During the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021, we made discretionary contributions of $ 300 million to Plan H in the United States and $ 25 million to our international plans. We expect to make an additional discretionary contribution of $ 200 million to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in the third quarter of 2021. During the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020, we made discretionary contributions of $ 150 million to Plan A in the United States. Note 8 - Debt Obligations In the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021, there were no maturities or prepayments of senior notes. As of March 20, 2021, we had no commercial paper outstanding. 17 Table of Contents Note 9 - Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. There have been no material changes during the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021 with respect to our risk management policies or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of March 20, 2021 was $ 262 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of March 20, 2021. The notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of March 20, 2021 and December 26, 2020 are as follows: Notional Amounts (a) 3/20/2021 12/26/2020 Commodity $ 1.1 $ 1.1 Foreign exchange $ 2.0 $ 1.9 Interest rate $ 3.0 $ 3.0 Net investment (b) $ 2.7 $ 2.7 (a) In billions. (b) The total notional of our net investment hedge consists of non-derivative debt instruments. As of March 20, 2021, approximately 2 % of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 3 % as of December 26, 2020. Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities Investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. Our held-to-maturity debt securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities and commercial paper. As of March 20, 2021, we had no investments in U.S. Treasury securities. As of December 26, 2020, we had $ 2.1 billion of investments in U.S. Treasury securities with $ 2.0 billion recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $ 0.1 billion in short-term investments. As of March 20, 2021, we had $ 525 million of investments in commercial paper with $ 375 million recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $ 150 million in short-term investments. As of December 26, 2020, we had $ 260 million of investments in commercial paper with $ 75 million recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $ 185 million in short-term investments. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Our investments mature in less than one year. As of March 20, 2021 and December 26, 2020, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material. 18 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of March 20, 2021 and December 26, 2020 are categorized as follows: 3/20/2021 12/26/2020 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Equity securities (b) 1 $ 124 $ — $ — $ — Index funds (c) 1 $ 240 $ — $ 231 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (d) 2 $ 17 $ — $ 18 $ — Deferred compensation (e) 2 $ — $ 488 $ — $ 477 Contingent consideration (f) 3 $ — $ 847 $ — $ 861 Derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments: Interest rate (g) 2 $ 1 $ — $ 2 $ — Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (h) 2 $ 7 $ 68 $ 9 $ 71 Interest rate (h) 2 28 304 13 307 Commodity (i) 2 59 — 32 — $ 94 $ 372 $ 54 $ 378 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (h) 2 $ 5 $ 5 $ 4 $ 8 Commodity (i) 2 32 10 19 7 $ 37 $ 15 $ 23 $ 15 Total derivatives at fair value (j) $ 132 $ 387 $ 79 $ 393 Total $ 513 $ 1,722 $ 328 $ 1,731 (a) Fair value hierarchy levels are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in both years. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities. (b) Based on the price of common stock. These are equity securities with readily determinable fair values and are classified as short-term investments. As of December 26, 2020, these equity securities did not have a readily determinable fair value. During the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021, we recorded a pre-tax unrealized gain on equity securities of $ 108 million ($ 82 million after-tax or $ 0.06 per share). These equity securities were subsequently sold in the second quarter of 2021. See Note 1 for further information. (c) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (d) Based primarily on the price of our common stock. (e) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections. (f) In connection with our acquisition of Rockstar Energy Beverages (Rockstar), we recorded a liability for tax-related contingent consideration payable over up to 15 years, with an option to accelerate all remaining payments, with estimated maximum payments of approximately $ 1.1 billion, using current tax rates. The fair value of the liability is estimated using probability-weighted, discounted future cash flows at current tax rates. The significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used to estimate the fair value include the expected future tax benefits associated with the acquisition, the probability that the option to accelerate all remaining payments will be exercised and discount rates. These unobservable inputs did not materially differ from those used as of December 26, 2020. The expected annual future tax benefits range from approximately $ 40 million to $ 110 million, with an average of $ 70 million. The probability, in any given year, that the option to accelerate will be exercised ranges from 3 to 25 percent, with a weighted-average payment period of approximately 3 years. The discount rates range from less than 1 percent to 5 percent, with a weighted average of 3 percent. The contingent consideration measured at fair value using unobservable inputs as of March 20, 2021 is $ 847 million, comprised of an $ 861 million liability as of December 26, 2020, and a fair value decrease of $ 14 million in the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021, recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. (g) Based on London Interbank Offered Rate forward rates. The carrying amount of hedged fixed-rate debt was $ 0.2 billion as of March 20, 19 Table of Contents 2021 and December 26, 2020 and classified on our balance sheet within short-term debt obligations. As of March 20, 2021 and December 26, 2020, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt was a $ 1 million gain and a $ 2 million gain, respectively. As of March 20, 2021, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments on discontinued hedges was a $ 14 million net loss, which is being amortized over the remaining life of the related debt obligations. (h) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates. (i) Based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements. (j) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of March 20, 2021 and December 26, 2020 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value due to their short-term maturity. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost, are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our debt obligations as of March 20, 2021 and December 26, 2020 was $ 46 billion and $ 50 billion, respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs. Losses/(gains) on our hedging instruments are categorized as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Fair Value/Non- designated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Income Statement (a) Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (b) 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 Foreign exchange $ 4 $ ( 11 ) $ 11 $ ( 51 ) $ 13 $ 4 Interest rate 1 ( 11 ) ( 18 ) 223 ( 4 ) 150 Commodity ( 81 ) 166 ( 90 ) 64 ( 10 ) 3 Net investment — — ( 63 ) ( 84 ) — — Total $ ( 76 ) $ 144 $ ( 160 ) $ 152 $ ( 1 ) $ 157 (a) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are primarily from fair value hedges and are included in net interest expense and other. These losses/gains are substantially offset by decreases/increases in the value of the underlying debt, which are also included in net interest expense and other. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. (b) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are included in net interest expense and other. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. Based on current market conditions, we expect to reclassify net gains of $ 76 million related to our cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income during the next 12 months. 20 Table of Contents Note 10 - Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share The computations of basic and diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 Income Shares (a) Income Shares (a) Basic net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 1.24 $ 0.96 Net income available for PepsiCo common shareholders $ 1,714 1,380 $ 1,338 1,390 Dilutive securities: Stock options, RSUs, PSUs and other (b) — 7 — 6 Diluted $ 1,714 1,387 $ 1,338 1,396 Diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 1.24 $ 0.96 (a) Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions).

On March 23, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Foods, a food and beverage company in South Africa with exports to countries across the globe, for 110.00 South African rand per share in cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 1.2 billion and was funded by two unsecured bridge loan facilities entered into by one of our international consolidated subsidiaries, which were fully repaid in April 2020. We accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition, in our AMESA segment. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in Pioneer Foods as of the acquisition date, which primarily include goodwill and other intangible assets of $ 0.8 billion and property, plant and equipment of $ 0.4 billion, are based on preliminary estimates that are subject to revisions and may result in adjustments to preliminary values as valuations are finalized. We will finalize these amounts in the second quarter of 2021. In connection with our acquisition of Pioneer Foods, we have made certain commitments to the South Africa Competition Commission, including a commitment to provide the equivalent of 7.7 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.4 billion as of the acquisition date, in value for the benefit of our employees, agricultural development, education, developing Pioneer Foods’ operations and enterprise 22 Table of Contents development programs in South Africa. Included in this commitment is 2.2 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.1 billion, relating to the implementation of an employee ownership plan and an agricultural, entrepreneurship and educational development fund, which is an irrevocable condition of the acquisition. This commitment was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 26, 2020 and is expected to be settled primarily in the second half of 2021. The remaining commitment of 5.5 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.3 billion as of the acquisition date, relates to capital expenditures and/or business-related costs which will be incurred and recorded over a five-year period from the acquisition date. Acquisition of Rockstar Energy Beverages On April 24, 2020, we acquired Rockstar, an energy drink maker with whom we had a distribution agreement prior to the acquisition, for an upfront cash payment of approximately $ 3.85 billion and contingent consideration related to estimated future tax benefits associated with the acquisition of approximately $ 0.9 billion. See Note 9 for further information about the contingent consideration. We accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition, primarily in our PBNA segment. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in Rockstar as of the acquisition date, which primarily include goodwill and other intangible assets of $ 4.7 billion, are based on preliminary estimates that are subject to revisions and may result in adjustments to preliminary values as valuations are finalized. We will finalize these amounts in the second quarter of 2021. Acquisition of Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. On June 1, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Be & Cheery, one of the largest online snacks companies in China, from Haoxiangni Health Food Co., Ltd. for cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 0.7 billion. We accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition, in our APAC segment. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in Be & Cheery as of the acquisition date, which primarily include goodwill and other intangible assets of $ 0.7 billion, are based on preliminary estimates that are subject to revisions and may result in adjustments to preliminary values as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible, but no later than the third quarter of 2021.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL REVIEW Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. Our Critical Accounting Policies The critical accounting policies below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2020 Form 10-K. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Income Taxes In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur. 24 Table of Contents Our Business Risks This Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act).

Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2020 Form 10-K and in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. COVID-19 Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to result in challenging operating environments and has affected almost all of the more than 200 countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, restrictions on public gatherings, shelter in place and safer-at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures continue in many of these markets. These measures have impacted and will continue to impact us, our customers (including foodservice customers), consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third 25 Table of Contents parties with whom we do business, which may result in changes in demand for our products, increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs, including expanded benefits and frontline incentives, costs associated with the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, or otherwise), or adverse impacts to our supply chain through reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, any of which can impact our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. In addition, measures that impact our ability to access our offices (several of which remain closed), plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or that impact the ability of our customers (including our foodservice customers), consumers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties to do the same, may continue to impact the availability or productivity of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely. Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact demand from consumers, including due to consumers not leaving their homes or leaving their homes less often than they did prior to the start of the pandemic or otherwise shopping for and consuming food and beverage products in a different manner than they historically have or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain of these jurisdictions and markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, spending levels and shopping and consumption preferences. Changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased demand for our products in subsequent quarters, or in a lower-margin sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from sales of our products. We continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences as markets move through varying stages of restrictions and re-opening at different times, including changes in at-home consumption, in immediate consumption and away-from-home channels, such as convenience and gas and foodservice. In addition, we continue to see an increase in demand in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels and any failure to capitalize on this demand could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow sales or category share and erode our competitive position. Any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products, reduced or canceled orders of our products, continued or additional closing of restaurants, stores, entertainment or sports complexes, schools or other venues in which our products are sold, or reduced capacity at any of the foregoing, or our business partners’ inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such adverse changes in our customers’ or business partners’ financial condition have also resulted and may continue to result in our recording additional charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice and vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. In addition, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants of the virus, the likelihood of a resurgence of positive cases, the 26 Table of Contents development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the speed at which such vaccines are administered, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. Risks Associated with International Operations In the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021, substantially all of our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January and February. In the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021, our operations outside of the United States generated 37% of our consolidated net revenue, with Canada, China, Mexico, Russia, South Africa and the United Kingdom comprising approximately 21% of our consolidated net revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 0.5 percentage points, primarily due to declines in the Russian ruble and Brazilian real, partially offset by an appreciation of the euro. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey, and natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. We also continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), including the effects of the post-Brexit trade deal entered into between the United Kingdom and the European Union in December 2020, as well as the economic, operating and political environment in Russia and the potential impact for our Europe segment and other businesses. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of March 20, 2021 and December 26, 2020 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of these items. Cautionary statements included above and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” in our 2020 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in increased regulatory focus on labeling in certain jurisdictions, including in Mexico which recently enacted product labeling requirements and limitations on the marketing of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. 27 Table of Contents We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. Retail Landscape Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Results of Operations – Consolidated Review Consolidated Results Volume Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Financial Results – Volume” included in our 2020 Form 10-K for further information on volume. We report substantially all of our international beverage volume on a monthly calendar basis. The 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021 include beverage volume outside of North America for the months of January and February. Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit 12 Weeks Ended 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 Change Net revenue $ 14,820 $ 13,881 7 % Operating profit $ 2,312 $ 1,924 20 % Operating profit margin 15.6 % 13.9 % 1.7 See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. Operating profit grew 20% and operating profit margin increased 1.7 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by effective net pricing and productivity savings, partially offset by certain 28 Table of Contents operating cost increases, a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and a decrease in organic volume. Higher mark-to-market gains on commodity derivatives included in “Items Affecting Comparability” contributed 12 percentage points to operating profit growth. An unrealized pre-tax gain of $108 million on our short-term investment in a publicly traded company also contributed 5 percentage points to operating profit growth. Additionally, lower charges compared to the prior year taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit growth. See Note 1 and Note 9 for further information. Results of Operations – Division Review While our financial results in North America are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of January and February are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021. See “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with GAAP. In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. Additionally, “acquisitions and divestitures” reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Unit volume declined slightly, primarily driven by mid-single-digit declines in trademark Cheetos and Fritos and a low-single-digit decline in trademark Lay’s, partially offset by high-single-digit-growth in variety packs and mid-single-digit growth in dips. Operating profit increased 3%, primarily reflecting the effective net pricing and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases. Furthermore, performance was negatively impacted by weather-related business disruptions. QFNA Net revenue grew 2%, primarily driven by favorable pricing, partially offset by a decrease in organic volume. Unit volume declined 4%, primarily driven by a mid-single-digit decline in oatmeal and high-single-digit declines in pancake syrup and mix and in bars, partially offset by double-digit growth in lite snacks. Operating profit experienced a slight decline, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, the decrease in organic volume and a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, largely offset by the favorable pricing and productivity savings. PBNA Net revenue increased 5%, primarily driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decrease in organic volume. In addition, acquisitions contributed 3 percentage points to net revenue growth. Unit volume decreased 2%, driven by a 2% decrease in carbonated soft drink (CSD) volume and a 1.5% decrease in non-carbonated beverage (NCB) volume. The NCB volume decrease primarily reflected a double-digit decrease in our overall water portfolio and a high-single-digit decrease in our juice and juice 31 Table of Contents drinks portfolio, partially offset by a double-digit increase in our energy portfolio, primarily due to acquisitions, and a low-single-digit increase in Gatorade sports drinks. Operating profit increased 23%, reflecting the effective net pricing, a 32-percentage-point impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation and information technology costs, the organic volume decrease, and a 4-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. Favorable settlements of promotional spending accruals compared to the prior year contribute d 5 percentage points to operating profit growth. In addition, acquisitions contributed 11 percentage points to operating profit growth. Furthermore, performance was negatively impacted by weather-related business disruptions. LatAm Net revenue decreased 5%, primarily reflecting an 8-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and a net organic volume decline, partially offset by effective net pricing. Snacks unit volume declined 2%, primarily reflecting low-single-digit declines in Brazil and Mexico. Beverage unit volume declined 4%, primarily reflecting a double-digit decline in Brazil and a low-single-digit decline in Mexico, partially offset by high-single-digit growth in Argentina, mid-single-digit growth in Chile and low-single-digit growth in Guatemala. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a decrease in consumer demand, which had a negative impact on beverage unit volume performance. Operating profit decreased 6%, primarily reflecting a 19-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, largely due to transaction-related foreign exchange, certain operating cost increases and the net organic volume decline. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing, productivity savings and lower advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, unfavorable foreign exchange translation and certain charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 8 percentage points and 6 percentage points, respectively. Europe Net revenue decreased 2%, primarily reflecting a 2-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. SodaStream International Ltd. (SodaStream) negatively impacted net revenue performance by 2 percentage points, primarily reflecting the prior-year benefit of an extra month of sales as we aligned SodaStream’s reporting calendar with that of our Europe division in the first quarter of 2020. Since being acquired in the fourth quarter of 2018, SodaStream had been reporting on a one-month lag. Snacks unit volume grew 4%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Turkey and high-single-digit growth in Russia, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Spain and low-single-digit declines in France and the Netherlands. Additionally, the United Kingdom and Poland each experienced low-single-digit growth. Beverage unit volume grew 7%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Germany, Russia and Turkey, partially offset by a double-digit decline in France and a low-single-digit decline in the United Kingdom. Operating profit decreased 10%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, a 21-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs driven by transaction-related foreign exchange and a 3-percentage-point impact of higher restructuring and impairment charges. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings, lower advertising and marketing expenses and effective net pricing. 32 Table of Contents Additionally, unfavorable foreign exchange translation negatively impacted operating profit performance by 3 percentage points. AMESA Net revenue increased 40%, primarily reflecting a 42-percentage-point impact of our Pioneer Foods acquisition and organic volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable net pricing. Snacks unit volume grew 232%, primarily reflecting a 228-percentage-point impact of our Pioneer Foods acquisition, double-digit growth in Pakistan and high-single-digit growth in India, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in the Middle East. Additionally, South Africa (excluding our Pioneer Foods acquisition) experienced low-single-digit growth. Beverage unit volume grew 5.5%, primarily reflecting a 4-percentage-point impact of our Pioneer Foods acquisition and double-digit growth in Pakistan, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in India and a slight decline in the Middle East. Additionally, Nigeria experienced slight growth. Operating profit increased 4%, primarily reflecting productivity savings, a 7-percentage-point contribution from our Pioneer Foods acquisition and lower advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by the unfavorable net pricing. APAC Net revenue increased 70%, primarily reflecting a 44-percentage-point impact of our Be & Cheery acquisition, organic volume growth and effective net pricing. Favorable foreign exchange contributed 8 percentage points to net revenue growth. Snacks unit volume grew 59%, primarily reflecting a 45-percentage-point impact of our Be & Cheery acquisition and double-digit growth in China (excluding our Be & Cheery acquisition). Additionally, Australia experienced low-single-digit growth, Thailand and Indonesia each experienced high-single-digit growth and Taiwan experienced double-digit growth. Beverage unit volume grew 15%, primarily reflecting double digit growth in China, partially offset by a double-digit decline in the Philippines and a mid-single-digit decline in Thailand. Additionally, Vietnam experienced mid-single-digit growth. Operating profit increased 47%, primarily reflecting the organic volume growth, a 10-percentage-point contribution from our Be & Cheery acquisition and productivity savings, partially offset by higher advertising and marketing expenses and certain operating cost increases.

Net interest expense and other decreased $32 million, primarily due to gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability, lower interest rates on average debt balances and higher average cash balances. These impacts were partially offset by higher average debt balances, as well as lower interest rates on average cash balances. The reported tax rate decreased 0.3 percentage points, primarily reflecting the decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; amounts associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; pension and retiree medical related items; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. 34 Table of Contents The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q are discussed below: Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, provision for income taxes and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Productivity Plan, merger and integration charges/credits associated with our acquisitions (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as net revenue growth adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash used for operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. 35 Table of Contents Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-Q are impacted by the following items in each of the following periods: 12 Weeks Ended 3/20/2021 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 6,671 $ 8,149 $ 5,837 $ 2,312 $ 120 $ 451 $ 1,714 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 36 (36) 39 (75) — (17) (58) Restructuring and impairment charges (2) 2 (35) 37 6 8 35 Merger and integration credits — — 10 (10) — (3) (7) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 6,705 $ 8,115 $ 5,851 $ 2,264 $ 126 $ 439 $ 1,684 12 Weeks Ended 3/21/2020 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 6,127 $ 7,754 $ 5,830 $ 1,924 $ 77 $ 360 $ 1,338 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (38) 38 (104) 142 — 35 107 Restructuring and impairment charges (2) 2 (30) 32 6 6 32 Merger and integration charges — — (25) 25 — 3 22 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 6,087 $ 7,794 $ 5,671 $ 2,123 $ 83 $ 404 $ 1,499 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. 12 Weeks Ended 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 Change Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, GAAP measure $ 1.24 $ 0.96 29 % Mark-to-market net impact (0.04) 0.08 Restructuring and impairment charges 0.03 0.02 Merger and integration (credits)/charges (0.01) 0.02 Core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, non-GAAP measure $ 1.21 (a) $ 1.07 (a) 13 % Impact of foreign exchange translation — Growth in core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP measure 14 % (a) (a) Does not sum due to rounding. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. 36 Table of Contents Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan In connection with our 2019 Productivity Plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion. Plan to date through March 20, 2021, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $840 million, including cash expenditures of $567 million. For the remainder of 2021, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $400 million, including cash expenditures of approximately $300 million, with the balance to be reflected in our 2022 and 2023 financial results. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2021 and 2022 results. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K, for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Merger and Integration Charges/Credits In the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021, we recorded merger and integration charges/credits related to our acquisitions of BFY Brands, Rockstar and Pioneer Foods. Merger and integration charges/credits primarily include changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, employee-related costs and other integration costs. In the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020, we recorded merger and integration charges related to our acquisitions of BFY Brands and Pioneer Foods. These charges primarily relate to contract termination and employee-related costs. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated dividend payments, debt repayments, payments for acquisitions, including the contingent consideration related to Rockstar, and the transition tax liability under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act), include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt and cash and cash equivalents. See “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2020 Form 10-K for further information. 37 Table of Contents Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by COVID-19 in the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business and financial results. See “Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2020 Form 10-K for further information related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results. As of March 20, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of March 20, 2021, our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.2 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. See “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2020 Form 10-K for further discussion of the TCJ Act. As of March 20, 2021, we had $3.7 billion of non-cancelable purchasing commitments, reflecting an increase of $1.4 billion from December 26, 2020, primarily due to new purchasing contracts and the timing of entering into contract renewals. For further information on our long-term contractual commitments, see “Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our 2020 Form 10-K. As part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of March 20, 2021 and December 26, 2020, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers who participate in these financing arrangements are outstanding. These supply chain finance arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. 38 Table of Contents Operating Activities During the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021, net cash used for operating activities of $0.7 billion was even with the prior year. Investing Activities During the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021, net cash provided by investing activities was $0.1 billion, primarily reflecting maturities of short-term investments with maturities of greater than three months of $0.5 billion, largely offset by net capital spending of $0.5 billion. We regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs. Financing Activities During the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021, net cash used for financing activities was $1.9 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividend payments of $1.4 billion and payments of short-term borrowings of $0.4 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and will expire on June 30, 2021. In addition, on February 11, 2021, we announced a 5% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.30 per share from $4.09 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2021. We expect to return a total of approximately $5.9 billion to shareholders in 2021, comprised of dividends of approximately $5.8 billion and share repurchases of $106 million. We completed our share repurchase activity during the 12 weeks ended March 20, 2021 and do not expect to repurchase any additional shares for the balance of 2021. See Part II, “Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” for a description of our share repurchase program. Free Cash Flow The table below reconciles net cash used for operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 12 Weeks Ended 3/20/2021 3/21/2020 Net cash used for operating activities, GAAP measure $ (719) $ (749) Capital spending (471) (484) Sales of property, plant and equipment 5 5 Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ (1,185) $ (1,228) We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2020 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. 39 Table of Contents Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2020 Form 10-K for further information. 40 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of March 20, 2021, the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the twelve weeks ended March 20, 2021 and March 21, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 26, 2020, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 10, 2021, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 26, 2020, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York April 14, 2021 41 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our first quarter of 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During our first quarter of 2021, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. In addition, in connection with our 2019 Productivity Plan, we continue to migrate to shared business service models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These transitions have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 42 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. The following information should be read in conjunction with the discussion set forth under Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our 2020 Form 10-K. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

See accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 8 Table of Contents Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2019 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 (2019 Form 10-K), as modified to reflect the adoption of the recently issued accounting pronouncement disclosed in Note 2 in this Form 10-Q. This report should be read in conjunction with our 2019 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. Preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The business and economic uncertainty resulting from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates. While our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of June, July and August are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended September 5, 2020, and the months of January through August are reflected in our results for the 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020. Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. 9 Table of Contents Our Divisions As previously disclosed in our 2019 Form 10-K, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with a strategic realignment of our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of, and allocates resources to, our reportable segments. Our historical segment reporting presented in this report has been retrospectively revised to reflect the new organizational structure. These changes did not impact our consolidated financial results. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information. We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada; 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe; 6) Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region. Net revenue of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/5/2020 9/7/2019 9/5/2020 9/7/2019 FLNA $ 4,399 $ 4,105 $ 12,746 $ 11,930 QFNA 608 576 1,906 1,710 PBNA 5,958 5,643 15,766 15,475 LatAm 1,654 1,904 4,531 5,031 Europe 3,323 3,222 7,887 7,842 AMESA (a) 1,252 957 2,866 2,533 APAC 897 781 2,215 2,000 Total $ 18,091 $ 17,188 $ 47,917 $ 46,521 (a) The increase in net revenue primarily reflects our acquisition of Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (Pioneer Foods). See Note 12 for further information. 10 Table of Contents Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage, food and snack products to our customers. The following tables reflect the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our food and snack business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue: 12 Weeks Ended 9/5/2020 9/7/2019 Beverage (a) Food/Snack Beverage (a) Food/Snack LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 55 % 45 % 55 % 45 % AMESA (b) 30 % 70 % 45 % 55 % APAC 25 % 75 % 30 % 70 % PepsiCo 45 % 55 % 50 % 50 % 36 Weeks Ended 9/5/2020 9/7/2019 Beverage (a) Food/Snack Beverage (a) Food/Snack LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 55 % 45 % 55 % 45 % AMESA (b) 35 % 65 % 45 % 55 % APAC 25 % 75 % 25 % 75 % PepsiCo 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % (a) Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe segments, is approximately 40 % of our consolidated net revenue. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. (b) The increase in the approximate percentage of net revenue generated by the food/snack business primarily reflects our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 12 for further information. Operating profit of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/5/2020 9/7/2019 9/5/2020 9/7/2019 FLNA $ 1,353 $ 1,286 $ 3,833 $ 3,694 QFNA 145 126 491 391 PBNA 697 640 1,391 1,719 LatAm 250 277 700 785 Europe 480 455 977 909 AMESA 193 210 386 551 APAC 163 166 494 388 Total division $ 3,281 $ 3,160 $ 8,272 $ 8,437 Corporate unallocated expenses ( 270 ) ( 305 ) ( 1,018 ) ( 845 ) Total $ 3,011 $ 2,855 $ 7,254 $ 7,592 11 Table of Contents Operating profit in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020 includes certain pre-tax charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These pre-tax charges by division are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 9/5/2020 Allowances for Expected Credit Losses (a) Upfront Payments to Customers (b) Inventory Write-Downs and Product Returns (c) Employee Compensation Expense (d) Employee Protection Costs (e) Other (f) Total FLNA $ — $ — $ 1 $ 24 $ 16 $ — $ 41 QFNA — — — 1 1 1 3 PBNA 3 — 1 14 12 20 50 LatAm — — 6 19 6 1 32 Europe 1 1 — 8 6 — 16 AMESA — — — 1 2 3 6 APAC (g) — — 2 ( 5 ) 1 1 ( 1 ) Total $ 4 $ 1 $ 10 $ 62 $ 44 $ 26 $ 147 36 Weeks Ended 9/5/2020 Allowances for Expected Credit Losses (a) Upfront Payments to Customers (b) Inventory Write-Downs and Product Returns (c) Employee Compensation Expense (d) Employee Protection Costs (e) Other (f) Total FLNA $ 19 $ — $ 8 $ 124 $ 49 $ 3 $ 203 QFNA 2 — — 7 2 1 12 PBNA 48 46 30 98 43 30 295 LatAm 1 — 12 35 14 4 66 Europe 5 2 10 17 14 17 65 AMESA 1 — 1 8 6 7 23 APAC (g) — — 3 ( 3 ) 2 2 4 Total $ 76 $ 48 $ 64 $ 286 $ 130 $ 64 $ 668 (a) Allowances reflect the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19, leveraging estimates of credit worthiness, default and recovery rates for certain of our customers, including foodservice and vending businesses. (b) Upfront payments relate to promotional spending for which benefit is not expected to be received. (c) Includes a reserve for product returns of $ 3 million and $ 19 million in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, respectively. (d) Includes incremental frontline incentive pay, crisis child care and other leave benefits and labor costs. (e) Includes costs associated with personal protective equipment, temperature scans, cleaning and other sanitization services. (f) Includes write-downs of property, plant and equipment, donations of cash and product, and other costs. (g) Income amounts include a social welfare relief credit of $ 7 million in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020. Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the impairment model used to measure credit losses for most financial assets. For our trade receivables, certain other receivables and certain other financial instruments, we are required to use a new forward-looking expected credit loss model that replaced the existing incurred credit loss model. The new model generally results in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosures. On initial recognition, we recorded an after-tax cumulative effect decrease to retained earnings of $ 34 million ($ 44 million pre-tax) as of the beginning of 2020. 12 Table of Contents Not Yet Adopted In 2019, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting, (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction, (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment, including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate, and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2021 with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2021. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. Note 3 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. In connection with this plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 2.5 billion and cash expenditures of approximately $ 1.6 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 70 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 15 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 15 % for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. We expect to complete this plan by 2023.

The related provisional measurement period allowed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) impacted our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. There were no tax amounts recognized in the 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020 related to the TCJ Act. In the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019, we recognized tax benefits of $ 29 million ($ 0.02 per share) related to the TCJ Act. For further information and discussion of the impact of the TCJ Act, refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K. Other Tax Matters On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF), effective January 1, 2020. In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, we recorded net tax benefits of $ 77 million primarily related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern in the third quarter of 2020. In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019, we recorded net tax benefits of $ 45 million and $ 33 million, respectively, related to the TRAF. While the accounting for the impacts of the TRAF are deemed to be complete, further adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures could be made in future quarters, including in connection with final tax return filings . For further information and discussion of the TRAF, refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions, including delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act and estimated income tax payments that we are deferring to future periods. Estimated federal income tax payments and mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act were made in the third quarter of 2020 and are no longer deferred. Additionally, we expect to pay the previously deferred payroll taxes in the fourth quarter of 2020. We do not currently expect the CARES Act to have a material impact on our financial results, including on our annual estimated effective tax rate or on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the CARES Act and similar legislation in other countries may have on our business and financial results.

We also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. In addition, lump sum payments may result in settlement charges that would be reflected as an item affecting comparability in future periods. During the 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, we made discretionary contributions of $ 325 million to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) in the United States and $ 14 million to our international plans. During the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019, we made discretionary contributions of $ 150 million to Plan A in the United States and $ 17 million to our international plans. Note 8 - Debt Obligations In the 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, we issued the following senior notes: Interest Rate Maturity Date Amount (a) 2.250 % March 2025 $ 1,500 2.625 % March 2027 $ 500 2.750 % March 2030 $ 1,500 3.500 % March 2040 $ 750 3.625 % March 2050 $ 1,500 3.875 % March 2060 $ 750 0.750 % May 2023 $ 1,000 1.625 % May 2030 $ 1,000 0.250 % May 2024 € 1,000 0.500 % May 2028 € 1,000 (a) Represents gross proceeds from issuances of long-term debt excluding debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums. The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper. In the 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, $ 750 million of senior notes matured and were paid. As of September 5, 2020, we had $ 2.1 billion of commercial paper outstanding. 19 Table of Contents In the second quarter of 2020, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on May 31, 2021. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros. We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of June 3, 2019. Funds borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under this agreement. The 364-Day Credit Agreement is in addition to our existing $ 3.75 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which expires on June 3, 2024 (Five-Year Credit Agreement). As of September 5, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under either the 364-Day Credit Agreement or the Five-Year Credit Agreement. On March 12, 2020, one of our international consolidated subsidiaries borrowed 21.7 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 1.3 billion, from our two unsecured bridge loan facilities (Bridge Loan Facilities) to fund our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. These borrowings were fully repaid in April 2020 and no further borrowings under these Bridge Loan Facilities are permitted. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we paid $ 1.1 billion to redeem all $ 1.1 billion outstanding principal amount of our 2.15 % senior notes due October 2020 and terminated associated interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $ 0.8 billion. Note 9 - Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. There have been no material changes during the 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020 with respect to our risk management policies or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of September 5, 2020 was $ 376 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of September 5, 2020. 20 Table of Contents The notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of September 5, 2020 and December 28, 2019 are as follows: Notional Amounts (a) 9/5/2020 12/28/2019 Commodity $ 1.0 $ 1.1 Foreign exchange $ 2.0 $ 1.9 Interest rate $ 4.2 $ 5.0 Net investment (b) $ 2.6 $ 2.5 (a) In billions. (b) The total notional of our net investment hedge consists of non-derivative debt instruments. As of September 5, 2020, approximately 10 % of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 9 % as of December 28, 2019. Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of September 5, 2020 and December 28, 2019 are categorized as follows: 9/5/2020 12/28/2019 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Short-term investments: Index funds (b) 1 $ 211 $ — $ 229 $ — Time deposits (c) 2 400 — — — $ 611 $ — $ 229 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (d) 2 $ 17 $ — $ 17 $ — Deferred compensation (e) 2 $ — $ 449 $ — $ 468 Contingent consideration (f) 3 $ — $ 874 $ — $ — Derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments: Interest rate (g) 2 $ 4 $ — $ — $ 5 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (h) 2 $ 21 $ 41 $ 5 $ 32 Interest rate (h) 2 — 366 — 390 Commodity (i) 1 — — 2 5 Commodity (j) 2 8 6 2 5 $ 29 $ 413 $ 9 $ 432 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (h) 2 $ 26 $ 3 $ 3 $ 2 Commodity (i) 1 — — 23 7 Commodity (j) 2 11 24 6 24 $ 37 $ 27 $ 32 $ 33 Total derivatives at fair value (k) $ 70 $ 440 $ 41 $ 470 Total $ 698 $ 1,763 $ 287 $ 938 (a) Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities. 21 Table of Contents (b) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (c) Time deposits classified as short-term investments approximate fair value due to their short-term maturity. (d) Based primarily on the price of our common stock. (e) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections. (f) In connection with our acquisition of Rockstar, we recorded a liability for tax-related contingent consideration payable over up to 15 years, with an option to accelerate all remaining payments, with estimated maximum payments of approximately $ 1.1 billion, using current tax rates. The fair value of the liability is estimated using probability-weighted, discounted future cash flows at current tax rates. The significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used to estimate the fair value include the expected future tax benefits associated with the acquisition, the probability that the option to accelerate all remaining payments will be exercised and discount rates. The expected annual future tax benefits range from approximately $ 40 million to $ 100 million, with an average of $ 70 million. The probability, in any given year, that the option to accelerate will be exercised ranges from 0 to 10 percent, with a weighted-average payment period of approximately 7 years. The discount rates range from less than 1 percent to 5 percent, with a weighted average of 2 percent. The contingent consideration measured at fair value using unobservable inputs as of September 5, 2020 is $ 874 million, comprised of an $ 848 million liability recognized at the acquisition date of Rockstar and a fair value increase of $ 10 million and $ 26 million in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, respectively, recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. (g) Based on London Interbank Offered Rate forward rates. As of September 5, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the carrying amount of hedged fixed-rate debt was $ 1.5 billion and $ 2.2 billion, respectively, and classified on our balance sheet within short-term and long-term debt obligations. As of September 5, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt was a $ 4 million gain and a $ 5 million loss, respectively. As of September 5, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments on discontinued hedges was a $ 28 million loss and a $ 49 million loss, respectively, which is being amortized over the remaining life of the related debt obligations. (h) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates. (i) Based on quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. (j) Based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements. (k) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of September 5, 2020 and December 28, 2019 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Collateral posted of $ 61 million and $ 58 million as of September 5, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively, is classified as restricted cash. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of September 5, 2020 and December 28, 2019 was $ 50 billion and $ 34 billion, respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs. Losses/(gains) on our hedging instruments are categorized as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Fair Value/Non- designated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Income Statement (a) Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (b) 9/5/2020 9/7/2019 9/5/2020 9/7/2019 9/5/2020 9/7/2019 Foreign exchange $ ( 10 ) $ 11 $ 31 $ ( 2 ) $ ( 22 ) $ 4 Interest rate 4 ( 12 ) ( 117 ) 65 ( 102 ) 38 Commodity ( 37 ) 27 ( 29 ) 32 24 1 Net investment — — 118 ( 40 ) — — Total $ ( 43 ) $ 26 $ 3 $ 55 $ ( 100 ) $ 43 22 Table of Contents 36 Weeks Ended Fair Value/Non- designated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Income Statement (a) Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (b) 9/5/2020 9/7/2019 9/5/2020 9/7/2019 9/5/2020 9/7/2019 Foreign exchange $ ( 11 ) $ 15 $ ( 47 ) $ 16 $ ( 37 ) $ — Interest rate ( 8 ) ( 62 ) ( 24 ) 117 ( 73 ) 54 Commodity 120 16 48 19 40 3 Net investment — — 159 ( 55 ) — — Total $ 101 $ ( 31 ) $ 136 $ 97 $ ( 70 ) $ 57 (a) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are primarily from fair value hedges and are included in net interest expense and other. These losses/gains are substantially offset by decreases/increases in the value of the underlying debt, which are also included in net interest expense and other. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. (b) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are included in cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are included in net interest expense and other. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. Based on current market conditions, we expect to reclassify net losses of $ 46 million related to our cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income during the next 12 months.

On March 23, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Foods, a food and beverage company in South Africa with exports to countries across the globe, for 110.00 South African rand per share in cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 1.2 billion and was funded by the Bridge Loan Facilities entered into by one of our international consolidated subsidiaries. See Note 8 for further information. We accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition, in our AMESA segment. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in Pioneer Foods as of the acquisition date, which primarily include goodwill and other intangible assets of $ 0.8 billion and property, plant and equipment of $ 0.4 billion, are based on preliminary estimates that are subject to revisions and may result in adjustments to preliminary values as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible, but no later than the second quarter of 2021. In connection with our acquisition of Pioneer Foods, we have made certain commitments to the South Africa Competition Commission, including a commitment to provide the equivalent of 7.7 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.5 billion as of the end of the third quarter of 2020, in value for the benefit of our employees, agricultural development, education, developing Pioneer Foods’ operations and enterprise development programs in South Africa. Included in this commitment is 2.2 billion South 26 Table of Contents African rand, or approximately $ 0.1 billion, relating to the implementation of an employee ownership plan and an agricultural, entrepreneurship and educational development fund, which is an irrevocable condition of the acquisition and will primarily be settled within the twelve-month period from the acquisition date. This was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020. The remaining commitment of 5.5 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.3 billion, relates to capital expenditures and/or business-related costs which will be incurred and recorded over a five-year period from the acquisition date. Acquisition of Rockstar Energy Beverages On April 24, 2020, we acquired Rockstar, an energy drink maker with whom we had a distribution agreement, for an upfront cash payment of approximately $ 3.85 billion and contingent consideration related to estimated future tax benefits associated with the acquisition of approximately $ 0.85 billion. See Note 9 for further information about the contingent consideration. The purchase price will also be adjusted for net working capital amounts as of the acquisition date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the acquisition agreement. We accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition, primarily in our PBNA segment. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in Rockstar as of the acquisition date, which primarily include goodwill and other intangible assets of $ 4.6 billion, are based on preliminary estimates that are subject to revisions and may result in adjustments to preliminary values as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible, but no later than the second quarter of 2021. In addition to our acquisition of Rockstar, as part of our overall energy strategy, we entered into an agreement with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the second quarter of 2020 for us and our bottlers to exclusively distribute Bang Energy drinks in the United States. Acquisition of Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. On June 1, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Be & Cheery, one of the largest online snacks companies in China, from Haoxiangni Health Food Co., Ltd. for cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 0.7 billion. The purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital amounts as of the acquisition date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the acquisition agreement. We accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition, in our APAC segment. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in Be & Cheery as of the acquisition date, which primarily include goodwill and other intangible assets of $ 0.7 billion, are based on preliminary estimates that are subject to revisions and may result in adjustments to preliminary values as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible, but no later than the third quarter of 2021. Acquisition of SodaStream International Ltd. (SodaStream) On December 5, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of SodaStream, a manufacturer and distributor of sparkling water makers, for $ 144.00 per share in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately $ 3.3 billion. The total consideration transferred was $ 3.3 billion (or $ 3.2 billion, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired). The purchase price allocation was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2019. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information. 27 Table of Contents Inventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges A summary of our inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/5/2020 9/7/2019 9/5/2020 9/7/2019 Cost of sales $ 11 $ — $ 30 $ 34 Selling, general and administrative expenses 32 7 256 12 Total $ 43 $ 7 $ 286 $ 46 After-tax amount $ 27 $ 6 $ 254 $ 38 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 0.02 $ — $ 0.18 $ 0.03 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets (recorded in cost of sales) and closing costs, employee-related costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and contract termination costs (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL REVIEW Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. Our Critical Accounting Policies The critical accounting policies below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2019 Form 10-K. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. 28 Table of Contents These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Income Taxes In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur. Our Business Risks This Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions.

These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the impact of the spread of COVID-19; future demand for PepsiCo’s products, as a result of changes in consumer preferences or otherwise; changes in laws related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging of PepsiCo’s products; changes in, or failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations; imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo’s products; imposition of labeling or warning requirements on PepsiCo’s products; PepsiCo’s ability to compete effectively; failure to realize anticipated benefits from PepsiCo’s productivity or reinvestment initiatives or operating model; political conditions, civil unrest or other developments and risks in the markets where PepsiCo’s products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCo’s ability to grow its business in developing and emerging markets; uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; the ability to protect information systems against, or effectively respond to, a cybersecurity incident or other disruption; increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies; water scarcity; business disruptions; product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns 29 Table of Contents with respect to product quality, safety and integrity; damage to PepsiCo’s reputation or brand image; failure to successfully complete, integrate or manage acquisitions and joint ventures into PepsiCo’s existing operations or to complete or manage divestitures or refranchisings; changes in estimates and underlying assumptions regarding future performance that can result in an impairment charge; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws, including as a result of enactment and implementation of the TRAF, or disagreements with tax authorities; PepsiCo’s ability to recruit, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce; loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any key customer; disruption to the retail landscape, including rapid growth in e-commerce channel and hard discounters; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCo’s credit ratings; PepsiCo’s ability to implement shared services or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively; fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change; failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or strikes or work stoppages; failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or infringement of intellectual property rights of others; potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other factors that may adversely affect the price of PepsiCo’s publicly traded securities and financial performance including those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2019 Form 10-K and in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. COVID-19 Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to result in challenging operating environments and has affected almost all of the more than 200 countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Authorities in many of these markets have implemented numerous and varying measures to stall the spread and ameliorate the impact of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, restrictions on public gatherings, shelter in place and safer-at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures, and have also implemented multi-step policies with the goal of re-opening these markets. These measures have impacted and will continue to impact us, our customers (including our foodservice customers), consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business. The countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold continue to operate in varying stages of restrictions and re-opening to address the COVID-19 pandemic. While some of these restrictions have been lifted or eased in certain jurisdictions, other jurisdictions have seen increases in new COVID-19 cases resulting in restrictions being reinstated, or new restrictions imposed in these jurisdictions. There continues to be considerable uncertainty regarding how current and future health and safety measures implemented in response to the pandemic will impact our business, including whether they will result i n further changes in demand for our products, further increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs, operating costs or otherwise), how they will further impact our supply chain and whether they will result in further reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, each or all of which can impact our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. To date, we have experienced employee absenteeism which has resulted in reduced manufacturing capacity at certain of our facilities and we have incurred increased costs as a result of COVID-19, including increased employee costs, such as expanded benefits and frontline incentives, and other operating costs, such as costs associated with the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, allowances for credit losses, upfront payment write-offs 30 Table of Contents and inventory write-offs, which have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our profitability. In addition, measures that impact our ability to access our offices (some of which remain closed), plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or that impact the ability of our customers (including our foodservice customers), consumers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties to do the same, may continue to impact the availability of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely. We continue to implement safet y protocols at our facilities, including temperature checks, health screening, providing personal protective equipment, increased sanitation, requiring the use of masks and facilitating social distancing in work and dining spaces, and have been working and will continue to work closely with our business partners on contingency planning i n an effort to maintain supply. To date, we have not experienced a material disruption to our operations or supply chain, although we can reasonably envision that possibility. Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact demand from consumers, including due to consumers not leaving their homes or leaving their homes less often than they did prior to the start of the pandemic or otherwise shopping and consuming food and beverage products in a different manner than they historically have or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. Changes in consumer demand as a result of COVID-19 continue to vary in scope and timing by jurisdiction as we sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks and the amount of revenue attributable to such products varies across these markets. Even as governmental restrictions continue to be relaxed and economies gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain of these markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, spending levels and shopping and consumption preferences. In addition, as a result of COVID-19, certain jurisdictions, such as certain states in Mexico, have enacted or are considering enacting new or expanded product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. Changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased consumer demand for our products in subsequent quarters, or in one sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from sales of our products. We continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences as markets move through varying stages of restrictions and re-opening at different times, including changes in at-home consumption, in immediate consumption and away-from-home channels, such as convenience and gas and foodservice. In addition, we continue to see a rapid increase in demand in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels and any failure to capitalize on this demand could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow sales or category share and erode our competitive position. Any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, which can result in an inability to pay for our products, reduced or canceled orders of our products, continued or additional closing of restaurants, stores, entertainment or sports complexes, schools or other venues in which our products are sold, or reduced capacity at any of the foregoing, or our business partners’ inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such adverse changes in our customers’ or business partners’ financial condition have also resulted and may continue to result in our recording additional impairment charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice and vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. In addition, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. 31 Table of Contents While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to try to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act The CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions, including delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act and estimated income tax payments that we are deferring to future periods. Estimated federal income tax payments and mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act were made in the third quarter of 2020 and are no longer deferred. Additionally, we expect to pay the previously deferred payroll taxes in the fourth quarter of 2020. We do not currently expect the CARES Act to have a material impact on our financial results, including on our annual estimated effective tax rate or on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the CARES Act and similar legislation in other countries may have on our business and financial results. Refer to the COVID-19 discussion above and Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Risks Associated with International Operations In the 12 weeks ended September 5, 2020, substantially all of our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of June, July and August. In the 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, substantially all of our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January through August. In the 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, our operations outside of the United States generated 40% of our consolidated net revenue, with Brazil, Canada, China, Mexico, Russia and the United Kingdom comprising approximately 20% of our consolidated net revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In each of the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 2 percentage points, primarily due to declines in the Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of tariffs in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, including how the United Kingdom will interact with other European Union countries following its departure, as well as the economic, operating and political environment in Russia and the potential impact for the Europe segment and our other businesses. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of September 5, 2020 and December 28, 2019 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of these items. Cautionary statements included above and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-Q, and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and in 32 Table of Contents “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” in our 2019 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. The related provisional measurement period allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. For further information on the impact of the TCJ Act, see Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K. Other Tax Matters On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF, effective January 1, 2020. In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, we recorded net tax benefits of $77 million primarily related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern in the third quarter of 2020. In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019, we recorded net tax benefits of $45 million and $33 million, respectively, related to the TRAF. While the accounting for the impacts of the TRAF are deemed to be complete, further adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures could be made in future quarters, including in connection with final tax return filings . See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information. 33 Table of Contents Retail Landscape Additionally, our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline, and other online purchasing by consumers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Results of Operations – Consolidated Review Consolidated Results Volume Volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Financial Results – Volume” included in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information on volume. We report substantially all of our international beverage volume on a monthly calendar basis. The 12 weeks ended September 5, 2020 include beverage volume outside of North America for the months of June, July and August. The 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020 include beverage volume outside of North America for the months of January through August. Our divisions’ physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended guidelines for single-serving sizes of food and beverage products. The FDA revised the guidelines on recommended serving size for beverage products, effective January 1, 2020. Previously, FDA guidelines recommended a serving size of 8 fluid ounces for all beverages. The revised guidelines recommend a serving size of 8 fluid ounces for beverages that consist of milk, fruit juices, nectars and fruit drinks and 12 fluid ounces for other beverages. No changes were recommended to the serving size of food products. The revised guidelines have been retrospectively applied to our prior-year servings. For the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, total servings increased 13% and 7%, respectively, primarily reflecting the contributions from our recent acquisitions. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information.

Operating profit growth was primarily driven by productivity savings and net revenue growth, partially offset by certain operating cost increases. A favorable mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives included in “Items Affecting Comparability” contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced operating profit growth by 5 percentage points. See Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 36 Weeks Operating profit decreased 4.5% and operating profit margin decreased 1.2 percentage points. Operating profit performance was primarily driven by certain operating cost increases, partially offset by productivity savings and net revenue growth. Higher inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges included in “Items Affecting Comparability” negatively impacted operating profit performance by 3 percentage points. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 8 percentage points. See Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Results of Operations – Division Review As previously disclosed in our 2019 Form 10-K, our historical segment reporting presented in this report has been retrospectively revised to reflect the new organizational structure. These changes did not impact our consolidated financial results. While our financial results in North America are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of June, July and August are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended September 5, 2020, and the months of January through August are reflected in our results for the 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020. See “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with GAAP. In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries, and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. Additionally, “acquisitions and divestitures” reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. 35 Table of Contents Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

The reported tax rate decreased 2.4 percentage points, primarily reflecting the net tax benefits related to the TRAF. Net income attributable to PepsiCo increased 9% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share increased 10%. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) positively contributed 4 percentage points to both net income attributable to PepsiCo growth and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share growth. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the 45 Table of Contents COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted both net income attributable to PepsiCo growth and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share growth by 5 percentage points. 36 Weeks Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $84 million, reflecting the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets, the impact of approved discretionary plan contributions and higher prior-year settlement losses, partially offset by the decrease in discount rates. Net interest expense and other increased $138 million, primarily due to higher average debt balances, lower interest rates on cash, as well as lower gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. These impacts were partially offset by lower interest rates on debt and higher average cash balances. The reported tax rate decreased 0.7 percentage points, reflecting a prior-year increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions and the net tax benefits related to the TRAF. These impacts were partially offset by a prior-year tax benefit related to an international restructuring and current-year non-deductible expenses related to an acquisition. Net income attributable to PepsiCo decreased 5% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share decreased 4%. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) negatively impacted both net income attributable to PepsiCo performance and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share performance by 3 percentage points. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted both net income attributable to PepsiCo performance and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share performance by 9 percentage points. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; amounts associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; pension and retiree medical related items; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. 46 Table of Contents The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q are discussed below: Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Productivity Plan, inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges associated with our acquisitions and net tax related to the TCJ Act (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, each on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as net revenue growth adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. 47 Table of Contents Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-Q are impacted by the following items in each of the following periods: 12 Weeks Ended 9/5/2020 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 8,156 $ 9,935 $ 6,924 $ 3,011 $ 86 $ 526 $ 2,291 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 38 (38) 33 (71) — (16) (55) Restructuring and impairment charges (1) 1 (59) 60 1 13 48 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges (11) 11 (32) 43 — 16 27 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 8,182 $ 9,909 $ 6,866 $ 3,043 $ 87 $ 539 $ 2,311 12 Weeks Ended 9/7/2019 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 7,694 $ 9,494 $ 6,639 $ 2,855 $ 38 $ 559 $ 2,100 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (13) 13 9 4 — 1 3 Restructuring and impairment charges (10) 10 (83) 93 5 16 82 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges — — (7) 7 — 1 6 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 7,671 $ 9,517 $ 6,558 $ 2,959 $ 43 $ 577 $ 2,191 36 Weeks Ended 9/5/2020 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 21,371 $ 26,546 $ 19,292 $ 7,254 $ 247 $ 1,396 $ 5,275 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 14 (14) (40) 26 — 8 18 Restructuring and impairment charges (4) 4 (112) 116 8 23 101 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges (30) 30 (256) 286 — 32 254 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 21,351 $ 26,566 $ 18,884 $ 7,682 $ 255 $ 1,459 $ 5,648 48 Table of Contents 36 Weeks Ended 9/7/2019 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 20,786 $ 25,735 $ 18,143 $ 7,592 $ 1,529 $ 27 $ 5,548 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 19 (19) 31 (50) (12) — (38) Restructuring and impairment charges (100) 100 (182) 282 57 4 221 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges (34) 34 (12) 46 8 — 38 Net tax related to the TCJ Act — — — — 29 — (29) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 20,671 $ 25,850 $ 17,980 $ 7,870 $ 1,611 $ 31 $ 5,740 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural products and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan In connection with our 2019 Productivity Plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, of which we have incurred $632 million plan to date through September 5, 2020, and cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion, of which we have incurred approximately $428 million plan to date through September 5, 2020. We expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $150 million and cash expenditures of approximately $100 million for the remainder of 2020, with the balance to be reflected in our 2021 through 2023 financial results. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2021 and 2022 results. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K, for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Inventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, we recorded inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges of $43 million ($27 million after-tax or $0.02 per share) and $286 million ($254 million after-tax or $0.18 per share), respectively. Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets, and closing costs, employee-related costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and contract termination costs related to our acquisitions of BFY Brands, Rockstar, Pioneer 49 Table of Contents Foods and Be & Cheery. Merger and integration charges also include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa related to our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019, we recorded inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges of $7 million ($6 million after-tax with a nominal amount per share) and $46 million ($38 million after-tax or $0.03 per share), respectively. These charges primarily relate to SodaStream’s acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheet, as well as merger and integration charges, including employee-related costs. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Net Tax Related to the TCJ Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. We recognized tax benefits of $29 million ($0.02 per share) in the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 related to the TCJ Act. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated share repurchases, dividend payments, debt repayments, payments for acquisitions, including the contingent consideration related to Rockstar, and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially impacted by COVID-19 in the 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of COVID-19 to have a material impact on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact COVID-19 may have on our business and financial results. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” as well as Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information. As of September 5, 2020, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of September 5, 2020, our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.2 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act. The CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions, including delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act and estimated income tax payments that we are deferring to future periods. Estimated federal income tax payments and mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act were made in the third quarter of 2020 and are no longer deferred. Additionally, we expect to pay the previously deferred payroll taxes in the fourth quarter of 2020. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the CARES Act and similar legislation in other countries may have on our business and financial results. 50 Table of Contents Operating Activities During the 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $6.1 billion, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $5.1 billion in the prior-year period. The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects favorable net working capital comparisons to 2019 and lower net cash tax payments in the current year. Investing Activities During the 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, net cash used for investing activities was $8.8 billion, primarily reflecting net cash paid in connection with our acquisitions of RockStar of $3.85 billion, Pioneer Foods of $1.2 billion and Be & Cheery of $0.7 billion, as well as net capital spending of $2.0 billion. For 2020, we now expect net capital spending to be approximately $4 billion, a reduction from our previously announced net capital spending expectation of approximately $5 billion, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Financing Activities During the 36 weeks ended September 5, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $6.4 billion, primarily reflecting proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $10.6 billion and net proceeds of short-term borrowings of $2.3 billion, partially offset by the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $5.6 billion and payments of long-term debt of $0.8 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and will expire on June 30, 2021. On February 13, 2020, we announced a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.09 per share from $3.82 per share, effective with the dividend paid in June 2020. We expect to return a total of approximately $7.5 billion to shareholders in 2020 through share repurchases of approximately $2 billion and dividends of approximately $5.5 billion. See Part II, “Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” for a description of our share repurchase program. Free Cash Flow The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 36 Weeks Ended 9/5/2020 9/7/2019 Net cash provided by operating activities, GAAP measure $ 6,123 $ 5,063 Capital spending (2,074) (1,959) Sales of property, plant and equipment 26 63 Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ 4,075 $ 3,167 51 Table of Contents We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2019 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information. 52 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 5, 2020, the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income and Equity for the twelve and thirty-six weeks ended September 5, 2020 and September 7, 2019, the related Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the thirty-six weeks ended September 5, 2020 and September 7, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 28, 2019, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 13, 2020, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 28, 2019, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York September 30, 2020 53 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our third quarter of 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During our third quarter of 2020, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. In addition, in connection with our 2019 Productivity Plan, we continue to migrate to shared business service models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These transitions have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 54 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. The following information should be read in conjunction with the discussion set forth under Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our 2019 Form 10-K. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2019 Form 10-K. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. The following additional risk factor relating to COVID-19 should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2019 Form 10-K and our Form 10-Qs for the fiscal quarter ended March 21, 2020 (Q1 2020 Form 10-Q) and the fiscal quarter ended June 13, 2020 (Q2 2020 Form 10-Q) . The developments described in this additional risk factor have heightened, or in some cases manifested, certain of the risks disclosed in the risk factor section of our 2019 Form 10-K, and such risk factors are further qualified by the information relating to COVID-19 that is described in this Form 10-Q and our Q1 2020 Form 10-Q and Q2 2020 Form 10-Q, including in the additional risk factor below. Except as described herein and in our Q1 2020 Form 10-Q and Q2 2020 Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes with respect to the risk factors disclosed in our 2019 Form 10-K. You should carefully consider the risks described below and in our 2019 Form 10-K, Q1 2020 Form 10-Q and Q2 2020 Form 10-Q in addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, our Q2 2020 Form 10-Q, our Q1 2020 Form 10-Q and in our 2019 Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. These risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the prices of our publicly traded securities. The risks described below and in our 2019 Form 10-K, our Q1 2020 Form 10-Q and our Q2 2020 Form 10-Q are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may occur or become material in the future and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the prices of our publicly traded securities. Therefore, historical operating results, financial and business performance, events and trends are often not a reliable indicator of future operating results, financial and business performance, events or trends. The impact of the spread of COVID-19 continues to create significant uncertainty for our business, financial condition and results of operations and for the prices of our publicly traded securities. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic, and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to result in challenging operating environments. COVID-19 continues to spread across the globe to almost all of the countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or 55 Table of Contents sold. Authorities in many of these markets have implemented numerous and varying measures to stall the spread and ameliorate the impact of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, restrictions on public gatherings, shelter in place and safer-at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures, and have also implemented multi-step policies with the goal of re-opening these markets. These measures have impacted and will continue to impact us, our customers (including our foodservice customers), consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business. The countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold continue to operate in varying stages of restrictions and re-opening to address the COVID-19 pandemic. While some of these restrictions have been lifted or eased in certain jurisdictions, other jurisdictions have seen increases in new COVID-19 cases resulting in restrictions being reinstated, or new restrictions imposed in these jurisdictions. There continues to be considerable uncertainty regarding how current and future health and safety meas ures implemented in response to the pandemic will impact our business, including whether they will result in further changes in demand for our products, further increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs, operating costs or otherwise), how they will further impact our supply chain and whether they will result in further reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, each or all of which can impact our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. To date, we have experienced employee absenteeism which has resulted in reduced manufacturing capacity at certain of our facilities and we have incurred increased costs as a result of COVID-19, including increased employee costs, such as expanded benefits and frontline incentives, and other operating costs, such as costs associated with the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, allowances for credit losses, upfront payment write-offs and inventory write-offs, which have negative ly impacted and may continue to negatively impact our profitability. In addition, measures that impact our ability to access our offices (some of which remain closed), plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or that impact the ability of our customers (including our foodservice customers), consumers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties to do the same, may continue to impact the availability of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely. If a significant percentage of our or our business partners’ workforce is unable to work, including because of illness, facility closures, quarantine, curfews, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions, social distancing requirements or other governmental restrictions or voluntarily adopted practices, our operations will be negatively impacted. Any sustained interruption in our or our business partners’ operations, distribution network or supply chain or any significant continuous shortage of raw materials or other supplies as a result of these measures, restrictions or disruptions, including as a result of increased demand for certain products, can impair our ability to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Compliance with governmental measures imposed in response to COVID-19 has caused and will continue to cause us to incur additional costs, and any inability to comply with such measures can subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, and other penalties, any of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has amplified certain risks to our business, including increased demand on our information technology resources and systems, increased phishing, business email compromise and other cybersecurity attacks, including increased introduction of malware, as cybercriminals try to exploit the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase in the number of points of potential attack, such as laptops and mobile devices (both of which are now being used in increased numbers), to be secured, and any failure to effectively manage these risks, including to timely identify and appropriately respond to any cyberattacks or other disruption to our technology infrastructure, may adversely affect our business. Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact demand from consumers, including due to consumers not leaving their homes or leaving their homes less 56 Table of Contents often than they did prior to the start of the pandemic or otherwise shopping and consuming food and beverage products in a different manner than they historically have or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. Changes in consumer demand as a result of COVID-19 continue to vary in scope and timing by jurisdiction as we sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks, and the amount of revenue attributable to such products varies across these markets. Even as governmental restrictions continue to be relaxed and economies gradually partially or fully reopen in certain of these markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, spending levels and shopping and consumption preferences. In addition, as a result of COVID-19, certain jurisdictions, such as certain states in Mexico, have enacted or are considering enacting new or expanded product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. Changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased consumer demand for our products in subsequent quarters, or in one sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from sales of our products. We continue to see shifts in product and channel prefe rences as markets move through varying stages of restrictions and re-opening at different times, including changes in at-home consumption, in immediate consumption and away-from-home channels, such as convenience and gas and foodservice. In addition, we continue to see a rapid increase in demand in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels and any failure to capitalize on this demand could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow sales or category share and erode our competitive position. Any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, which can result in an inability to pay for our products, reduced or canceled orders of our products, continued or additional closing of restaurants, stores, entertainment or sports complexes, schools or other venues in which our products are sold, or reduced capacity at any of the foregoing, or our business partners’ inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such advers e changes in our customers’ or business partners’ financial condition have also resulted and may continue to result in our recording additional impairment charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice and vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. In addition, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to try to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on our employees and our business, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the prices of our publicly traded securities may be adversely affected. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

See accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 7 Table of Contents Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2019 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 (2019 Form 10-K), as modified to reflect the adoption of the recently issued accounting pronouncement disclosed in Note 2 in this Form 10-Q. This report should be read in conjunction with our 2019 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. Preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The business and economic uncertainty resulting from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates. While our financial results in the United States and Canada ( North America ) are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of March, April and May are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended June 13, 2020 , and the months of January through May are reflected in our results for the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 . Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. 8 Table of Contents Our Divisions As previously disclosed in our 2019 Form 10-K, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with a strategic realignment of our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of, and allocates resources to, our reportable segments. Our historical segment reporting presented in this report has been retrospectively revised to reflect the new organizational structure. These changes did not impact our consolidated financial results. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information. We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada; 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe; 6) Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region. Net revenue of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 FLNA $ 4,273 $ 4,010 $ 8,347 $ 7,825 QFNA 664 540 1,298 1,134 PBNA 4,970 5,322 9,808 9,832 LatAm 1,567 1,886 2,877 3,127 Europe 2,725 3,000 4,564 4,620 AMESA 983 997 1,614 1,576 APAC 763 694 1,318 1,219 Total $ 15,945 $ 16,449 $ 29,826 $ 29,333 Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage, food and snack products to our customers. The following tables reflect the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our food and snack business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue: 12 Weeks Ended 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 Beverage (a) Food/Snack Beverage (a) Food/Snack LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 50 % 50 % 55 % 45 % AMESA 40 % 60 % 45 % 55 % APAC 25 % 75 % 30 % 70 % PepsiCo 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % 9 Table of Contents 24 Weeks Ended 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 Beverage (a) Food/Snack Beverage (a) Food/Snack LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 55 % 45 % 55 % 45 % AMESA 35 % 65 % 45 % 55 % APAC 25 % 75 % 25 % 75 % PepsiCo 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % (a) Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe segments, was approximately 40 % of our consolidated net revenue. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. Operating profit of each division is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 FLNA $ 1,278 $ 1,249 $ 2,480 $ 2,408 QFNA 196 127 346 265 PBNA 397 690 694 1,079 LatAm 219 278 450 508 Europe 351 339 497 454 AMESA 59 236 193 341 APAC 189 116 331 222 Total division $ 2,689 $ 3,035 $ 4,991 $ 5,277 Corporate unallocated expenses ( 370 ) ( 306 ) ( 748 ) ( 540 ) Total $ 2,319 $ 2,729 $ 4,243 $ 4,737 Operating profit in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 includes certain pre-tax charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These pre-tax charges by division are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 6/13/2020 Allowances for Expected Credit Losses (a) Upfront Payments to Customers (b) Inventory Write-Downs and Product Returns (c) Employee Compensation Expense (d) Employee Protection Costs (e) Other (f) Total FLNA (g) $ ( 2 ) $ — $ 4 $ 100 $ 33 $ — $ 135 QFNA — — — 6 1 — 7 PBNA 4 2 7 84 31 9 137 LatAm 1 — 6 16 8 3 34 Europe — 1 10 9 8 17 45 AMESA 1 — 1 7 4 4 17 APAC — — — 2 1 — 3 Total $ 4 $ 3 $ 28 $ 224 $ 86 $ 33 $ 378 10 Table of Contents 24 Weeks Ended 6/13/2020 Allowances for Expected Credit Losses (a) Upfront Payments to Customers (b) Inventory Write-Downs and Product Returns (c) Employee Compensation Expense (d) Employee Protection Costs (e) Other (f) Total FLNA $ 19 $ — $ 7 $ 100 $ 33 $ 3 $ 162 QFNA 2 — — 6 1 — 9 PBNA 45 46 29 84 31 10 245 LatAm 1 — 6 16 8 3 34 Europe 4 1 10 9 8 17 49 AMESA 1 — 1 7 4 4 17 APAC — — 1 2 1 1 5 Total $ 72 $ 47 $ 54 $ 224 $ 86 $ 38 $ 521 (a) Allowances reflect the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19, leveraging estimates of credit worthiness, default and recovery rates for certain of our customers, including foodservice and vending businesses. (b) Upfront payments relate to promotional spending for which benefit will not be received. (c) Inventory write-downs and product returns include a reserve for product returns of $ 9 million and $ 16 million in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020, respectively. (d) Includes incremental frontline incentive pay, crisis child care and other leave benefits and labor costs. (e) Includes costs associated with personal protective equipment, temperature scans, cleaning and other sanitization services. (f) Includes write-downs of property, plant and equipment, donations of cash and product and other certain costs. (g) Income amount represents adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts. Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the impairment model used to measure credit losses for most financial assets. For our trade receivables, certain other receivables and certain other financial instruments, we are required to use a new forward-looking expected credit loss model that replaced the existing incurred credit loss model. The new model generally results in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosures. On initial recognition, we recorded an after-tax cumulative effect decrease to retained earnings of $ 34 million ( $ 44 million pre-tax) as of the beginning of 2020. Not Yet Adopted In 2019, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting, (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction, (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment, including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate, and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2021 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and the timing of adoption. 11 Table of Contents Note 3 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. In connection with this plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 2.5 billion and cash expenditures of approximately $ 1.6 billion . These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 70 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 15 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 15 % for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. We expect to complete this plan by 2023. The total expected plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 11 % 2 % 30 % 10 % 25 % 8 % 5 % 9 % A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 Cost of sales $ 1 $ 82 $ 3 $ 90 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23 76 53 99 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense/(income) (a) 1 — 7 ( 5 ) Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 25 $ 158 $ 63 $ 184 After-tax amount $ 21 $ 120 $ 53 $ 143 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 0.02 $ 0.08 $ 0.04 $ 0.10 (a) Income amount represents adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts. 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 through 6/13/2020 FLNA $ 2 $ 6 $ 7 $ 6 $ 60 QFNA — — 1 — 8 PBNA — 10 3 16 94 LatAm 4 21 9 21 80 Europe 8 53 16 59 121 AMESA 5 8 7 16 48 APAC 3 34 3 37 52 Corporate 2 26 10 34 64 24 158 56 189 527 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense/(income) (a) 1 — 7 ( 5 ) 44 Total $ 25 $ 158 $ 63 $ 184 $ 571 (a) Income amount represents adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts. 12 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 through 6/13/2020 Severance and other employee costs $ 2 $ 43 $ 24 $ 40 $ 310 Asset impairments 4 76 5 84 97 Other costs (a) 19 39 34 60 164 Total $ 25 $ 158 $ 63 $ 184 $ 571 (a) Includes other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including contract termination costs, consulting and other professional fees. A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan activity for the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 is as follows: Severance and Other Employee Costs Asset Impairments Other Costs Total Liability as of December 28, 2019 $ 128 $ — $ 21 $ 149 2020 restructuring charges 24 5 34 63 Cash payments ( 59 ) — ( 50 ) ( 109 ) Non-cash charges and translation ( 11 ) ( 5 ) 3 ( 13 ) Liability as of June 13, 2020 $ 82 $ — $ 8 $ 90 Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at June 13, 2020 is expected to be paid by the end of 2020 .

The related provisional measurement period allowed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) impacted our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. There were no tax amounts recognized in the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 related to the TCJ Act. In the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , we recognized tax benefits of $ 29 million ( $ 0.02 per share) related to the TCJ Act. Other Tax Matters On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing ( TRAF ), effective January 1, 2020. There were no income tax adjustments recorded in the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 related to the TRAF. Enactment of additional TRAF provisions subsequent to June 13, 2020 is expected to result in adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results. For further information and discussion of the impacts of the TCJ Act and the TRAF, refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions, including delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act, and estimated income tax payments that we are deferring to future periods. We do not currently expect the CARES Act to have a material impact on our financial results, including on our annual estimated effective tax rate or on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the CARES Act and similar legislation in other countries may have on our business and financial results.

We also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. During the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020, we made a discretionary contribution of $ 150 million to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) in the United States and $ 14 million to our international plans. During the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019, we made discretionary contributions of $ 150 million to Plan A in the United States and $ 17 million to our international plans. Note 8 - Debt Obligations In the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 , we issued the following senior notes: Interest Rate Maturity Date Amount (a) 2.250 % March 2025 $ 1,500 2.625 % March 2027 $ 500 2.750 % March 2030 $ 1,500 3.500 % March 2040 $ 750 3.625 % March 2050 $ 1,500 3.875 % March 2060 $ 750 0.750 % May 2023 $ 1,000 1.625 % May 2030 $ 1,000 0.250 % May 2024 € 1,000 0.500 % May 2028 € 1,000 (a) Represents gross proceeds from issuances of long-term debt excluding debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums. The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper. In the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 , $ 750 million of senior notes matured and were paid. 17 Table of Contents As of June 13, 2020 , we had $ 2.8 billion of commercial paper outstanding. In the second quarter of 2020, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on May 31, 2021. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros. We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of June 3, 2019. Funds borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under this agreement. The 364-Day Credit Agreement is in addition to our existing $ 3.75 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which expires on June 3, 2024 (Five-Year Credit Agreement). As of June 13, 2020 , there were no outstanding borrowings under either the 364-Day Credit Agreement or the Five-Year Credit Agreement. On March 12, 2020, one of our international consolidated subsidiaries borrowed 21.7 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 1.3 billion , from our two unsecured bridge loan facilities (Bridge Loan Facilities) to fund our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. These borrowings were fully repaid in April 2020 and no further borrowings under these Bridge Loan Facilities are permitted. Note 9 - Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. There have been no material changes during the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 with respect to our risk management policies or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings), and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of June 13, 2020 was $ 530 million . We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of June 13, 2020 . The notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of June 13, 2020 and December 28, 2019 are as follows: Notional Amounts (a) 6/13/2020 12/28/2019 Commodity $ 1.1 $ 1.1 Foreign exchange $ 2.1 $ 1.9 Interest rate $ 4.3 $ 5.0 Net investment (b) $ 2.5 $ 2.5 (a) In billions. (b) The total notional of our net investment hedge consists of non-derivative debt instruments. As of June 13, 2020 , approximately 12 % of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 9 % as of December 28, 2019 . 18 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of June 13, 2020 and December 28, 2019 are categorized as follows: 6/13/2020 12/28/2019 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Short-term investments (b) 1 $ 196 $ — $ 229 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (c) 2 $ 16 $ — $ 17 $ — Deferred compensation (d) 2 $ — $ 428 $ — $ 468 Contingent consideration (e) 3 $ — $ 864 $ — $ — Derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments: Interest rate (f) 2 $ 7 $ — $ — $ 5 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 54 $ 20 $ 5 $ 32 Interest rate (g) 2 — 483 — 390 Commodity (h) 1 — — 2 5 Commodity (i) 2 1 27 2 5 $ 55 $ 530 $ 9 $ 432 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 10 $ 8 $ 3 $ 2 Interest rate (j) 2 — 1 — — Commodity (h) 1 — — 23 7 Commodity (i) 2 15 42 6 24 $ 25 $ 51 $ 32 $ 33 Total derivatives at fair value (k) $ 87 $ 581 $ 41 $ 470 Total $ 299 $ 1,873 $ 287 $ 938 (a) Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities. (b) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (c) Based primarily on the price of our common stock. (d) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections. (e) In connection with our acquisition of Rockstar, we recorded a liability for tax-related contingent consideration payable over up to 15 years , with an option to accelerate all remaining payments, with estimated maximum payments of approximately $ 1.1 billion , using current tax rates. The fair value of the liability is estimated using probability-weighted, discounted future cash flows at current tax rates. The significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used to estimate the fair value include the expected future tax benefits associated with the acquisition, the probability that the option to accelerate all remaining payments will be exercised and discount rates. The expected annual future tax benefits range from approximately $ 40 million to $ 100 million , with an average of $ 70 million . The probability, in any given year, that the option to accelerate will be exercised ranges from 0 to 10 percent, with a weighted average payment period of approximately 7 years . The discount rates range from less than 1 percent to 5 percent, with a weighted average of 2 percent. The contingent consideration measured at fair value using unobservable inputs for the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 is $ 864 million , comprised of an $ 848 million liability recognized at the acquisition date of Rockstar and a fair value increase of $ 16 million recorded in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 in selling, general and administrative expenses. (f) Based on London Interbank Offered Rate forward rates. As of June 13, 2020 and December 28, 2019 , the carrying amount of hedged fixed-rate debt was $ 1.5 billion and $ 2.2 billion , respectively, and classified on our balance sheet within short-term and long-term debt obligations. As of June 13, 2020 and December 28, 2019 , the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt was a $ 7 million gain and a $ 5 million loss, respectively. As of June 13, 2020 and December 28, 2019 , the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments on discontinued hedges was a $ 35 million loss and a $ 49 million loss, respectively, which is being amortized over the remaining life of the related debt obligations. (g) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates. (h) Based on quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. 19 Table of Contents (i) Based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements. (j) Based on Johannesburg Interbank Average Rate forward rates. (k) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of June 13, 2020 and December 28, 2019 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Collateral posted of $ 64 million and $ 58 million as of June 13, 2020 and December 28, 2019 , respectively, is classified as restricted cash. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of June 13, 2020 and December 28, 2019 was $ 51 billion and $ 34 billion , respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs.

On March 23, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Foods, a food and beverage company in South Africa with exports to countries across the globe, for 110.00 South African rand per share in cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 1.2 billion and was funded by the Bridge Loan Facilities entered into by one of our international consolidated subsidiaries. See Note 8 for further information. We accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition, in our AMESA segment. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in Pioneer Foods as of the acquisition date, which primarily include goodwill and other intangible assets of $ 0.8 billion and property, plant and equipment of $ 0.4 billion , are based on preliminary estimates that are subject to revisions and may result in adjustments to preliminary values as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible, but no later than the second quarter of 2021. In connection with our acquisition of Pioneer Foods, we have made certain commitments to the South Africa Competition Commission, including a commitment to provide the equivalent of 7.7 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.4 billion as of the end of the second quarter of 2020, in value for the benefit of our employees, agricultural development, education, developing Pioneer Foods’ operations and enterprise development programs in South Africa. Included in this commitment is 2.2 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.1 billion relating to the implementation of an employee ownership plan and an agricultural, entrepreneurship and educational development fund, which was recorded in selling, general and 23 Table of Contents administrative expenses in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 since it is an irrevocable condition of the acquisition and will primarily be settled within the twelve-month period from the acquisition date. The remaining commitment of 5.5 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.3 billion , relates to capital expenditures and/or business-related costs which will be incurred and recorded over a five-year period from the acquisition date. Acquisition of Rockstar Energy Beverages On April 24, 2020, we acquired Rockstar, an energy drink maker with whom we had a distribution agreement, for an upfront cash payment of approximately $ 3.85 billion and contingent consideration related to estimated future tax benefits associated with the acquisition of approximately $ 0.85 billion . See Note 9 for further information about the contingent consideration. The purchase price will also be adjusted for net working capital amounts as of the acquisition date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the acquisition agreement. We accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition, primarily in our PBNA segment. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in Rockstar as of the acquisition date, which primarily include goodwill and other intangible assets of $ 4.7 billion , are based on preliminary estimates that are subject to revisions and may result in adjustments to preliminary values as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible, but no later than the second quarter of 2021. In addition to our acquisition of Rockstar, as part of our overall energy strategy, we entered into an agreement with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for us and our bottlers to exclusively distribute Bang Energy drinks in the United States. Acquisition of Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. (Be & Cheery) On June 1, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Be & Cheery, one of the largest online snacks companies in China, from Haoxiangni Health Food Co., Ltd. for cash . The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 0.7 billion . The purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the acquisition date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the acquisition agreement. We will account for the transaction as a business combination in the third quarter of 2020. We will recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition, in our APAC segment. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in Be & Cheery as of the acquisition date, which primarily include goodwill and other intangible assets, will be based on preliminary estimates that are subject to revisions and may result in adjustments to preliminary values as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible, but no later than the third quarter of 2021. Acquisition of SodaStream International Ltd. (SodaStream) On December 5, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of SodaStream, a manufacturer and distributor of sparkling water makers, for $ 144.00 per share in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately $ 3.3 billion . The total consideration transferred was $ 3.3 billion (or $ 3.2 billion , net of cash and cash equivalents acquired). The purchase price allocation was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2019. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information. 24 Table of Contents Inventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges A summary of our inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 Cost of sales 19 20 19 34 Selling, general and administrative expenses 199 4 224 5 Total $ 218 $ 24 $ 243 $ 39 After-tax amount $ 205 $ 19 $ 227 $ 32 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 0.15 $ 0.01 $ 0.16 $ 0.02 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets (recorded in cost of sales) and liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, as well as closing costs, employee-related costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and contract termination costs (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL REVIEW Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. Our Critical Accounting Policies The critical accounting policies below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2019 Form 10-K. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. 25 Table of Contents These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Income Taxes In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur. Our Business Risks This Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the impact of the spread of COVID-19; future demand for PepsiCo’s products, as a result of changes in consumer preferences or otherwise; changes in laws related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging of PepsiCo’s products; changes in, or failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations; imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo’s products; imposition of labeling or warning requirements on PepsiCo’s products; PepsiCo’s ability to compete effectively; failure to realize anticipated benefits from PepsiCo’s productivity or reinvestment initiatives or operating model; political conditions, civil unrest or other developments and risks in the markets where PepsiCo’s products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCo’s ability to grow its business in developing and emerging markets; uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; the ability to protect information systems against, or effectively respond to, a cybersecurity incident or other disruption; increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies; water scarcity; business disruptions; product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality, safety and integrity; damage to PepsiCo’s reputation or brand image; failure to successfully complete, integrate or manage acquisitions and joint ventures into 26 Table of Contents PepsiCo’s existing operations or to complete or manage divestitures or refranchisings; changes in estimates and underlying assumptions regarding future performance that can result in an impairment charge; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws, including as a result of enactment and implementation of the TRAF, or disagreements with tax authorities; PepsiCo’s ability to recruit, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce; loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any key customer; disruption to the retail landscape, including rapid growth in e-commerce channel and hard discounters; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCo’s credit ratings; PepsiCo’s ability to implement shared services or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively; fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change; failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or strikes or work stoppages; failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or infringement of intellectual property rights of others; potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other factors that may adversely affect the price of PepsiCo’s publicly traded securities and financial performance including those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2019 Form 10-K and in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. COVID-19 Our global operations expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has continued to result in challenging operating environments and has affected almost all of the more than 200 countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Authorities in many of these markets have implemented numerous and varying measures to stall the spread and ameliorate the impact of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, shelter in place and safer-at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures, and have also implemented multi-step policies with the goal of re-opening these markets. These measures have impacted and will continue to impact us, our customers (including our foodservice customers), consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business. The countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold are in varying stages of restrictions and re-opening to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain jurisdictions have begun re-opening only to return to restrictions in the face of increases in new COVID-19 cases. There is considerable uncertainty regarding how current and future health and safety measures implemented in response to the pandemic will impact our business, including whether they will result in further changes in demand for our products, further increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs, operating costs or otherwise), how they will further impact our supply chain and whether they will result in further reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, each or all of which can impact our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. To date, we have incurred increased costs as a result of COVID-19, including increased employee costs, such as expanded benefits and frontline incentives, and other operating costs, such as costs associated with the provision of personal protective equipment, allowances for credit losses, upfront payment write-offs and inventory write-offs, which have negatively impacted our profitability. In addition, measures that impact our ability to access our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities (some of which are currently closed), or that impact the ability of our customers (including our foodservice customers), consumers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties to do the same, may continue to impact the availability of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely. We continue to implement safety protocols at our facilities 27 Table of Contents and have been working and will continue to work closely with our business partners on contingency planning in an effort to maintain supply. To date, we have not experienced a material disruption to our operations or supply chain, although we can reasonably envision that possibility. Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 impacts demand from consumers, including due to consumers not leaving their homes or leaving their homes less often than they did prior to the start of the pandemic or otherwise shopping and consuming food and beverage products in a different manner than they historically have or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. Changes in consumer demand as a result of COVID-19 continues to vary in scope and timing by jurisdiction as we sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks and the amount of revenue attributable to such products varies across these markets. Even as government restrictions are lifted and economies gradually reopen in certain of these markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, spending levels and shopping and consumption preferences. In addition, changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased consumer demand for our products in subsequent quarters, or in one sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from sales of our products. We continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences as markets move through varying stages of restrictions and re-opening at different times, including changes in at-home consumption, in immediate consumption and away-from-home channels, such as convenience and gas and foodservice. In addition, we continue to see a rapid increase in demand in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels and any failure to capitalize on this demand could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow sales or category share and erode our competitive position. Any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, which can result in an inability to pay for our products, reduced or canceled orders of our products, continued or additional closing of restaurants, stores, entertainment or sports complexes or other venues in which our products are sold, or our business partners’ inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such adverse changes in our customers’ or business partners’ financial condition may also result in our recording additional impairment charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice and vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. In addition, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to try to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. 28 Table of Contents Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act The CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions, including delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act, and estimated income tax payments that we are deferring to future periods. We do not currently expect the CARES Act to have a material impact on our financial results, including on our annual estimated effective tax rate or on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the CARES Act and similar legislation in other countries may have on our business and financial results. Refer to the COVID-19 discussion above and Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Risks Associated with International Operations In the 12 weeks ended June 13, 2020 , substantially all of our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of March, April and May . In the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 substantially all of our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January through May . In the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 , our operations outside of the United States generated 39% of our consolidated net revenue, with Brazil, Canada, China, Mexico, Russia and the United Kingdom, comprising approximately 20% of our consolidated net revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 , unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted net revenue performance by 4 percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively, primarily due to declines in the Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of tariffs in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, including how the United Kingdom will interact with other European Union countries following its departure, as well as the economic, operating and political environment in Russia and the potential impact for the Europe segment and our other businesses. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of June 13, 2020 and December 28, 2019 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of these items. Cautionary statements included above and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-Q, and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” in our 2019 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage 29 Table of Contents waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. The related provisional measurement period allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. For further information on the impact of the TCJ Act, see Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K. Other Tax Matters On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF , effective January 1, 2020. There were no income tax adjustments recorded in the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 related to the TRAF. Enactment of additional TRAF provisions subsequent to June 13, 2020 is expected to result in adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information. Retail Landscape Additionally, our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline, and other online purchasing by consumers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Results of Operations – Consolidated Review Consolidated Results Volume Volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating 30 Table of Contents performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Financial Results – Volume” included in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information on volume. We report substantially all of our international beverage volume on a monthly calendar basis. The 12 weeks ended June 13, 2020 include beverage volume outside of North America for the months of March, April and May . The 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 include beverage volume outside of North America for the months of January through May . Our divisions’ physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended guidelines for single-serving sizes of food and beverage products. The FDA revised the guidelines on recommended serving size for beverage products, effective January 1, 2020. Previously, FDA guidelines recommended a serving size of 8 fluid ounces for all beverages. The revised guidelines recommend a serving size of 8 fluid ounces for beverages that consist of milk, fruit juices, nectars and fruit drinks and 12 fluid ounces for other beverages. No changes were recommended to the serving size of food products. For the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 , total servings increased 1% and 3.5%, respectively, which reflects the impact of the revised guidelines on our prior-year servings. Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 Change 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 Change Net revenue $ 15,945 $ 16,449 (3 )% $ 29,826 $ 29,333 2 % Operating profit $ 2,319 $ 2,729 (15 )% $ 4,243 $ 4,737 (10 )% Operating profit margin 14.5 % 16.6 % (2.1 ) 14.2 % 16.1 % (1.9 ) See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. 12 Weeks Operating profit decreased 15% and operating profit margin decreased 2.1 percentage points. Operating profit performance was primarily driven by certain operating cost increases, a net volume decline and a 3-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by productivity savings, lower advertising and marketing expenses and effective net pricing. Higher inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges included in “Items Affecting Comparability” negatively impacted operating profit performance by 25 percentage points and were largely offset by lower restructuring and impairment charges and a favorable mark to market net impact on commodity derivatives which positively contributed 17 percentage points and 6 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit performance. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 13 percentage points. See Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 24 Weeks Operating profit decreased 10% and operating profit margin decreased 1.9 percentage points. Operating profit performance was primarily driven by certain operating cost increases, partially offset by productivity savings and net revenue growth. Higher inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges included in “Items Affecting Comparability” negatively impacted operating profit performance by 4.5 percentage points. Additionally, 31 Table of Contents the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 11 percentage points. See Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Results of Operations – Division Review As previously disclosed in our 2019 Form 10-K, our historical segment reporting presented in this report has been retrospectively revised to reflect the new organizational structure. These changes did not impact our consolidated financial results. While our financial results in North America are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of March, April and May are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended June 13, 2020 , and the months of January through May are reflected in our results for the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 . See “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with GAAP. In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries, and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. Additionally, “acquisitions and divestitures” reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. 32 Table of Contents Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

In certain instances, volume growth varies from the amounts disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between bottler case sales and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE), as well as the mix of beverage volume sold by our company-owned and franchise-owned bottlers. Our net revenue excludes nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, is based on CSE. Operating Profit, Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis Operating profit adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit growth adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures.

Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10- 42 Table of Contents Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; amounts associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; pension and retiree medical related items; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q are discussed below: Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Productivity Plan, inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges associated with our acquisitions and net tax related to the TCJ Act (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, each on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as net revenue growth adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. 43 Table of Contents Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.

Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural products and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan In connection with our 2019 Productivity Plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, of which we have incurred $571 million plan to date through June 13, 2020 and cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion, of which we have incurred approximately $370 million plan to date through June 13, 2020 . We expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $200 million and cash expenditures of approximately $150 million for the remainder of 2020 , with the balance to be reflected in our 2021 through 2023 financial results. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2021 and 2022 results. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Inventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020, we recorded inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges of $218 million ( $205 million after-tax or $0.15 per share) and $243 million ( $227 million after-tax or $0.16 per share), respectively. Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets and 45 Table of Contents liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, as well as closing costs, employee-related costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and contract termination costs related to our acquisitions of BFY Brands, Rockstar and Pioneer Foods. In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019, we recorded inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges of $24 million ($19 million after-tax or $0.01 per share) and $39 million ($32 million after-tax or $0.02 per share), respectively. These charges primarily relate to SodaStream’s acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheet, as well as merger and integration charges, including employee-related costs. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Net Tax Related to the TCJ Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. We recognized tax benefits of $29 million ($0.02 per share) in the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 related to the TCJ Act. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated share repurchases, dividend payments, debt repayments, payments for acquisitions, including the contingent consideration related to Rockstar, and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially impacted by COVID-19 in the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of COVID-19 to have a material impact on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact COVID-19 may have on our business and financial results. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” as well as Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information. As of June 13, 2020 , cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of June 13, 2020 , our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.3 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act. The CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions, including delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act, and estimated income tax payments that we are deferring to future periods. We do not currently expect the CARES Act to have a material impact on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the CARES Act and similar legislation in other countries may have on our business and financial results. 46 Table of Contents Operating Activities During the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 , net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion , compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion in the prior-year period. The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects lower net cash tax payments in the current year, partially offset by unfavorable net working capital comparisons to 2019. Investing Activities During the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 , net cash used for investing activities was $6.8 billion , primarily reflecting net cash paid in connection with our acquisitions of RockStar of $3.85 billion and Pioneer Foods of $1.2 billion, as well as net capital spending of $1.2 billion. In light of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we are currently reviewing our plans with respect to net capital spending. Financing Activities During the 24 weeks ended June 13, 2020 , net cash provided by financing activities was $9.0 billion , primarily reflecting proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $10.6 billion and net proceeds of short-term borrowings of $2.9 billion, partially offset by the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $3.8 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and will expire on June 30, 2021. On February 13, 2020, we announced a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.09 per share from $3.82 per share, effective with the dividend paid in June 2020 . We expect to return a total of approximately $7.5 billion to shareholders in 2020 through share repurchases of approximately $2 billion and dividends of approximately $5.5 billion. See Part II, “Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” for a description of our share repurchase program. Free Cash Flow The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 24 Weeks Ended 6/13/2020 6/15/2019 Net cash provided by operating activities, GAAP measure $ 1,462 $ 1,388 Capital spending (1,188 ) (1,167 ) Sales of property, plant and equipment 18 42 Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ 292 $ 263 We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2019 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. 47 Table of Contents Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information. 48 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 13, 2020 , the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income and Equity for the twelve and twenty-four weeks ended June 13, 2020 and June 15, 2019 , the related Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the twenty-four weeks ended June 13, 2020 and June 15, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 28, 2019 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 13, 2020, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 28, 2019 , is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York July 13, 2020 49 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our second quarter of 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During our second quarter of 2020 , we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. In addition, in connection with our 2019 Productivity Plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These transitions have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 50 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. The following information should be read in conjunction with the discussion set forth under Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our 2019 Form 10-K. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2019 Form 10-K. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. The following additional risk factor relating to COVID-19 should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2019 Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 21, 2020 (Q1 2020 Form 10-Q). The developments described in this additional risk factor have heightened, or in some cases manifested, certain of the risks disclosed in the risk factor section of our 2019 Form 10-K, and such risk factors are further qualified by the information relating to COVID-19 that is described in this Form 10-Q and our Q1 2020 Form 10-Q, including in the additional risk factor below. Except as described herein and in our Q1 2020 Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes with respect to the risk factors disclosed in our 2019 Form 10-K. You should carefully consider the risks described below and in our 2019 Form 10-K and Q1 2020 Form 10-Q in addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, our Q1 2020 Form 10-Q and in our 2019 Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. These risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the prices of our publicly traded securities. The risks described below and in our 2019 Form 10-K and Q1 2020 Form 10-Q are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may occur or become material in the future and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the prices of our publicly traded securities. Therefore, historical operating results, financial and business performance, events and trends are often not a reliable indicator of future operating results, financial and business performance, events or trends. The impact of the spread of COVID-19 continues to create significant uncertainty for our business, financial condition and results of operations and for the prices of our publicly traded securities. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic, and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. Our global operations expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has continued to result in challenging operating environments. COVID-19 continues to spread across the globe to almost all of the countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Authorities in many of these markets have implemented numerous measures to stall the spread and ameliorate the impact of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, shelter in place and safer-at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures, and have also implemented multi-step polices with the goal of re- 51 Table of Contents opening these markets. These measures have impacted and continue to impact us, our employees, customers (including our foodservice customers), consumers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business. The countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold are in varying stages of restrictions and re-opening to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain jurisdictions have begun re-opening only to return to restrictions in the face of increases in new COVID-19 cases. There is considerable uncertainty regarding how current and future health and safety measures implemented in response to the pandemic will impact our business, including whether they will result in further changes in demand for our products, further increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs, operating costs or otherwise), how they will further impact our supply chain and whether they will result in further reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, each or all of which can impact our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. To date, we have incurred increased costs as a result of COVID-19, including increased employee costs, such as expanded benefits and frontline incentives, and other operating costs, such as costs associated with the provision of personal protective equipment, allowances for credit losses, upfront payment write-offs and inventory write-offs, which have negatively impacted our profitability. In addition, measures that impact our ability to access our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities (some of which are currently closed), or that impact the ability of our customers (including our foodservice customers), consumers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties to do the same, may continue to impact the availability of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely. If a significant percentage of our or our business partners’ workforce is unable to work, including because of illness, facility closures, quarantine, curfews, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions, social distancing requirements or other governmental restrictions or voluntarily adopted practices, our operations will be negatively impacted. Any sustained interruption in our or our business partners’ operations, distribution network or supply chain or any significant continuous shortage of raw materials or other supplies as a result of these measures, restrictions or disruptions, including as a result of increased demand for certain products, can impair our ability to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Compliance with governmental measures imposed in response to COVID-19 has caused and will continue to cause us to incur additional costs, and any inability to comply with such measures can subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, and other penalties, any of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has amplified certain risks to our business, including increased demand on our information technology resources and systems, increased phishing and other cybersecurity attacks as cybercriminals try to exploit the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase in the number of points of potential attack, such as laptops and mobile devices (both of which are now being used in increased numbers), to be secured, and any failure to effectively manage these risks, including to timely identify and appropriately respond to any cyberattacks, may adversely affect our business. Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 impacts demand from consumers, including due to consumers not leaving their homes or leaving their homes less often than they did prior to the start of the pandemic or otherwise shopping and consuming food and beverage products in a different manner than they historically have or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. Changes in consumer demand as a result of COVID-19 continue to vary in scope and timing as we sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks, and the amount of revenue attributable to such products varies across these markets. Even as governmental restrictions are lifted and economies gradually reopen, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, spending levels and shopping and consumption preferences. In addition, changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased consumer demand for 52 Table of Contents our products in subsequent quarters, or in one sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from sales of our products. We continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences, including an increase in at-home consumption, in immediate consumption and away-from-home channels, such as convenience and gas and foodservice. In addition, we continue to see a rapid increase in demand in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels and any failure to capitalize on this demand could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow sales or category share and erode our competitive position. Any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, which can result in an inability to pay for our products, reduced or canceled orders of our products, continued or additional closing of restaurants, stores, entertainment or sports complexes or other venues in which our products are sold, or our business partners’ inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such adverse changes in our customers’ or business partners’ financial condition may also result in our recording additional impairment charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice and vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. In addition, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to try to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on our employees and our business, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the prices of our publicly traded securities may be adversely affected. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2019 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 (2019 Form 10-K), as modified to reflect the adoption of the recently issued accounting pronouncement disclosed in Note 2 in this Form 10-Q. This report should be read in conjunction with our 2019 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. While our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of January and February are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 . Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Our Divisions As previously disclosed in our 2019 Form 10-K, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with a recent strategic realignment of our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of, and allocates resources to, our reportable segments. Our historical segment reporting presented in this report has been retrospectively revised to reflect the new organizational structure. These changes did not impact our consolidated financial results. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information. We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada; 8 Table of Contents 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe; 6) Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region. Net revenue and operating profit of each division are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Net Revenue (a) 3/21/2020 3/23/2019 FLNA $ 4,074 $ 3,815 QFNA 634 594 PBNA 4,838 4,510 LatAm 1,310 1,241 Europe 1,839 1,620 AMESA 631 579 APAC 555 525 Total $ 13,881 $ 12,884 (a) Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage, food and snack products to our customers. For the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 and March 23, 2019, our food and snack business represented approximately 55 % of our consolidated net revenue. Internationally, LatAm’s food and snack business represented approximately 90 % of the segment’s revenue, Europe’s beverage business and food and snack business represented approximately 55 % and 45 % , respectively, of the segment’s net revenue, AMESA’s beverage business and food and snack business represented approximately 35 % and 65 % , respectively, of the segment’s net revenue and APAC’s beverage business and food and snack business represented approximately 20 % and 80 % , respectively, of the segment’s net revenue. Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe segments, was approximately 40 % of our consolidated net revenue. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. 12 Weeks Ended Operating Profit 3/21/2020 3/23/2019 FLNA (a) $ 1,202 $ 1,159 QFNA (a) 150 138 PBNA (a) 297 389 LatAm 231 230 Europe (a) 146 115 AMESA 134 105 APAC (a) 142 106 Total division $ 2,302 $ 2,242 Corporate unallocated expenses ( 378 ) ( 234 ) Total $ 1,924 $ 2,008 (a) In the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020, operating profit includes $ 143 million of certain charges taken as a result of the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic, including $ 68 million of incremental allowances for expected credit losses ( $ 21 million in FLNA, $ 2 million in QFNA, $ 41 million in PBNA and $ 4 million in Europe), $ 44 million of write-downs against upfront payments to customers in PBNA, $ 26 million of inventory write-downs and product returns ( $ 3 million in FLNA, $ 22 million in PBNA and $ 1 million in APAC) and $ 5 million of certain other charges ( $ 3 million in FLNA, $ 1 million in PBNA and $ 1 million in APAC). 9 Table of Contents Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the impairment model used to measure credit losses for most financial assets. For our trade receivables, certain other receivables and certain other financial instruments, we are required to use a new forward-looking expected credit loss model that replaced the existing incurred credit loss model. The new model generally results in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. We adopted this guidance prospectively in the first quarter of 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosures. We recorded an after-tax cumulative effect decrease to retained earnings of $ 34 million ( $ 44 million pre-tax) as of the beginning of 2020 and, during the first quarter of 2020, we increased our allowance for expected credit losses and recorded a pre-tax charge of $ 68 million . This increase in allowance reflects the forward-looking expected impact of the global economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19, leveraging estimates of credit worthiness, default and recovery rates for certain of our customers, including foodservice and vending businesses. Not Yet Adopted In 2019, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting, (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction, (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment, including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate, and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2021 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and the timing of adoption. Note 3 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. In connection with this plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 2.5 billion and cash expenditures of approximately $ 1.6 billion . These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 70 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 15 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 15 % for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. We expect to complete this plan by 2023. The total expected plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 11 % 2 % 30 % 10 % 25 % 8 % 5 % 9 % 10 Table of Contents A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/21/2020 3/23/2019 Cost of sales $ 2 $ 8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 30 23 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense/(income) 6 ( 5 ) Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 38 $ 26 After-tax amount $ 32 $ 23 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 0.02 $ 0.02 12 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 3/21/2020 3/23/2019 through 3/21/2020 FLNA $ 5 $ — $ 58 QFNA 1 — 8 PBNA 3 6 94 LatAm 5 — 76 Europe 8 6 113 AMESA 2 8 43 APAC — 3 49 Corporate 8 8 62 32 31 503 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense/ (income) (a) 6 ( 5 ) 43 Total $ 38 $ 26 $ 546 (a) Income amount represents adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts. 12 Weeks Ended Plan to Date 3/21/2020 3/23/2019 through 3/21/2020 Severance and other employee costs (a) $ 22 $ ( 3 ) $ 308 Asset impairments 1 8 93 Other costs (b) 15 21 145 Total $ 38 $ 26 $ 546 (a) Income amount represents adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.

A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan activity for the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 is as follows: Severance and Other Employee Costs Asset Impairments Other Costs Total Liability as of December 28, 2019 $ 128 $ — $ 21 $ 149 2020 restructuring charges 22 1 15 38 Cash payments ( 31 ) — ( 29 ) ( 60 ) Non-cash charges and translation ( 9 ) ( 1 ) 4 ( 6 ) Liability as of March 21, 2020 $ 110 $ — $ 11 $ 121 Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at March 21, 2020 is expected to be paid by the end of 2020 . 11 Table of Contents Other Productivity Initiatives There were no material charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives described above.

(c) The change in translation and other primarily reflects the depreciation of the Russian ruble. 13 Table of Contents Note 5 - Income Taxes Tax Cuts and Jobs Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. The related provisional measurement period allowed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) impacted our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. There were no tax amounts recognized in the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 related to the TCJ Act. In the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 , we recognized tax benefits of $ 29 million ( $ 0.02 per share) related to the TCJ Act. Other Tax Matters On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing ( TRAF ), effective January 1, 2020. There were no income tax adjustments recorded in the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 related to the TRAF. Enactment of additional TRAF provisions subsequent to March 21, 2020 is expected to result in adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results. For further information and discussion of the impacts of the TCJ Act and the TRAF, refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K. Subsequent to the end of our first quarter, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions, including delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act, and estimated income tax payments that we expect to defer to future periods. We do not currently expect the CARES Act to have a material impact on our financial results, including on our annual estimated effective tax rate, or on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the CARES Act and similar legislation in other countries may have on our business and financial results.

In the 12 15 Table of Contents weeks ended March 21, 2020, we made a discretionary contribution of $ 150 million to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) in the United States. In the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019, we made discretionary contributions of $ 150 million to Plan A in the United States and $ 17 million to our international plans. Note 8 - Debt Obligations In the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 , we issued the following senior notes: Interest Rate Maturity Date Amount (a) 2.250 % March 2025 $ 1,500 2.625 % March 2027 $ 500 2.750 % March 2030 $ 1,500 3.500 % March 2040 $ 750 3.625 % March 2050 $ 1,500 3.875 % March 2060 $ 750 (a) Represents gross proceeds from issuances of long-term debt excluding debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums. The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper. In the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 , there were no maturities or prepayments of senior notes. As of March 21, 2020 , we had $ 2.8 billion of commercial paper outstanding. On March 12, 2020, one of our international consolidated subsidiaries borrowed 21.7 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 1.3 billion , from our two unsecured bridge loan facilities (Bridge Loan Facilities) to fund our acquisition of Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (Pioneer Foods). These borrowings are subject to a weighted-average initial annual interest rate of 7.5 % , which resets every month, have maturity dates within one year and can be prepaid at any time. No further borrowings under these Bridge Loan Facilities are permitted. On April 14, 2020, we repaid 6.6 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 360 million , with no gain or loss recorded, and we have initiated repayment of the remaining outstanding borrowings and therefore expect these Bridge Loan Facilities to be fully repaid in the second quarter of 2020. Note 9 - Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. There have been no material changes during the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 with respect to our risk management policies or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings), and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of March 21, 2020 was $ 672 million . We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of March 21, 2020 . 16 Table of Contents The notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of March 21, 2020 and December 28, 2019 are as follows: Notional Amounts (a) 3/21/2020 12/28/2019 Commodity $ 1.2 $ 1.1 Foreign exchange $ 1.8 $ 1.9 Interest rate $ 5.0 $ 5.0 Net investment (b) $ 2.4 $ 2.5 (a) In billions. (b) The total notional of our net investment hedge consists of non-derivative debt instruments.

Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of March 21, 2020 and December 28, 2019 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Collateral posted of $ 201 million and $ 58 million as of March 21, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively, is classified as restricted c ash. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of March 21, 2020 and December 28, 2019 was $ 43 billion and $ 34 billion , respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL REVIEW Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Also refer to Note 1 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. 21 Table of Contents Our Critical Accounting Policies The critical accounting policies below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2019 Form 10-K. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Income Taxes In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur. Our Business Risks This Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the impact of the spread of COVID-19; future demand for PepsiCo’s products, as a result of changes in consumer preferences or otherwise; changes in laws related 22 Table of Contents to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging of PepsiCo’s products; changes in, or failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations; imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo’s products; imposition of labeling or warning requirements on PepsiCo’s products; PepsiCo’s ability to compete effectively; failure to realize anticipated benefits from PepsiCo’s productivity or reinvestment initiatives or operating model; political conditions, civil unrest or other developments and risks in the markets where PepsiCo’s products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCo’s ability to grow its business in developing and emerging markets; uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; the ability to protect information systems against, or effectively respond to, a cybersecurity incident or other disruption; increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies; water scarcity; business disruptions; product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality, safety and integrity; damage to PepsiCo’s reputation or brand image; failure to successfully complete, integrate or manage acquisitions and joint ventures into PepsiCo’s existing operations or to complete or manage divestitures or refranchisings; changes in estimates and underlying assumptions regarding future performance that can result in an impairment charge; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws, including as a result of enactment and implementation of the TRAF, or disagreements with tax authorities; PepsiCo’s ability to recruit, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce; loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any key customer; disruption to the retail landscape, including rapid growth in e-commerce channel and hard discounters; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCo’s credit ratings; PepsiCo’s ability to implement shared services or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively; fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change; failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or strikes or work stoppages; failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or infringement of intellectual property rights of others; potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other factors that may adversely affect the price of PepsiCo’s publicly traded securities and financial performance including those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2019 Form 10-K and in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. COVID-19 Our global operations expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in challenging operating environments. COVID-19 has spread across the globe to almost all of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Authorities in many of these markets have implemented numerous measures to stall the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, shelter in place orders, and business shutdowns. These measures have impacted and will further impact us, our customers (including our foodservice customers), consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business. There is considerable uncertainty regarding how these measures and future measures in response to the pandemic will impact our business, including whether they will result in further changes in demand for our products, further increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs or otherwise), how they will further impact our supply chain and whether they will result in further reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, each or all of which can impact our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. In addition, measures that impact our ability to access our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or that impact the ability of our customers (including our foodservice customers), 23 Table of Contents consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties to do the same, may impact the availability of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely. We have implemented safety protocols at our facilities and have been working and will continue to work closely with our business partners on contingency planning in an effort to maintain supply. To date, we have not experienced a material disruption to our operations or supply chain, although we can reasonably envision that possibility. Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 impacts demand from consumers, including due to consumers not leaving their homes or otherwise shopping in a different manner than they historically have or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. As we sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories, the profile of the products we sell and the amount of revenue attributable to such products varies by jurisdiction and changes in demand as a result of COVID-19 will vary in scope and timing across these markets. In addition, changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased consumer demand for our products in subsequent quarters, or in one sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from sales of our products. For example, to date, we have seen a shift in product and channel preferences, including an increase in at-home consumption and a decrease in immediate consumption and away-from-home channels, such as convenience and gas and foodservice, which negatively impacts our beverage businesses. Any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, resulting in an inability to pay for our products, reduced or canceled orders of our products, closing of restaurants, stores, entertainment or sports complexes or other venues in which our products are sold, or our business partners’ inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such adverse changes in our customers’ or business partners’ financial condition may also result in our recording additional impairment charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice and vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. In addition, economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to try to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which all will vary by market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act Subsequent to the end of our first quarter, the CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions, including delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act, and estimated income tax payments that we expect to defer to future periods. We do not currently expect the CARES Act to have a material impact on our financial results, including on our annual estimated effective tax rate, or on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the CARES Act and similar legislation in other countries may have on our business and financial results. Refer to the COVID-19 discussion above for further information. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 24 Table of Contents Risks Associated with International Operations In the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 , substantially all of our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January and February . In the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 , our operations outside of the United States generated 35% of our consolidated net revenue, with Mexico, Canada, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and Brazil comprising approximately 19% of our consolidated net revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 , unfavorable foreign exchange had a net nominal impact on net revenue growth primarily due to declines in the Brazilian real and euro, offset by appreciation in the Russian ruble. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of tariffs in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, including how the United Kingdom will interact with other European Union countries following its departure, as well as the economic, operating and political environment in Russia and the potential impact for the Europe segment and our other businesses. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of March 21, 2020 and December 28, 2019 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of these items. Cautionary statements included above and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-Q, and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” in our 2019 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used varies by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. 25 Table of Contents Tax Cuts and Jobs Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. The related provisional measurement period allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. For further information on the impact of the TCJ Act, see Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K. Other Tax Matters On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF , effective January 1, 2020. There were no income tax adjustments recorded in the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 related to the TRAF. Enactment of additional TRAF provisions subsequent to March 21, 2020 is expected to result in adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Retail Landscape Additionally, our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Results of Operations – Consolidated Review Consolidated Results Volume Volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Financial Results – Volume” included in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information on volume. We report substantially all of our international beverage volume on a monthly calendar basis. The 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 include beverage volume outside of North America for the months of January and February . Our divisions’ physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended guidelines for single-serving sizes of food and beverage products. The FDA revised the guidelines on recommended serving size for beverage products, effective January 1, 2020. Previously, FDA guidelines recommended a serving size of 8 fluid ounces for all beverages. The revised guidelines recommend a serving size of 8 fluid ounces for beverages that consist of milk, fruit juices, nectars and fruit drinks and 12 fluid ounces for other beverages. No changes were recommended to the serving size of food products. For the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 , total servings increased 6%, which reflects the impact of the revised guidelines on our prior-year servings. 26 Table of Contents Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit 12 Weeks Ended 3/21/2020 3/23/2019 Change Net revenue $ 13,881 $ 12,884 8 % Operating profit $ 1,924 $ 2,008 (4 )% Operating profit margin 13.9 % 15.6 % (1.7 ) See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. We estimate that changes in consumer consumption patterns arising from the COVID-19 pandemic contributed approximately 2 percentage points to net revenue and organic revenue growth. This estimate of the COVID-19 impact to reported net revenue and organic revenue growth is based on our internal analysis of expected revenue performance as reflected in our internal records before and after when we believe, based on information currently available to us, the primary markets in each segment appear to have experienced changes in consumer patterns in response to the spread of COVID-19. Operating profit decreased 4% and operating profit margin decreased 1.7 percentage points. Operating profit performance was primarily driven by a 10-percentage-point impact of an unfavorable mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives, primarily related to fuel-related derivatives, included in corporate unallocated expenses (see “Items Affecting Comparability”). Net revenue growth and productivity savings positively contributed to operating profit performance and were partially offset by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, certain charges taken in connection with COVID-19 negatively impacted operating profit performance by 7 percentage points. Results of Operations – Division Review As previously disclosed in our 2019 Form 10-K, our historical segment reporting presented in this report has been retrospectively revised to reflect the new organizational structure. These changes did not impact our consolidated financial results. While our financial results in North America are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of January and February are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 . See “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with GAAP. In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries, and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. Additionally, “acquisitions and divestitures” reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. 27 Table of Contents Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

In certain instances, volume growth varies from the amounts disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between bottler case sales and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE), as well as the mix of beverage volume sold by our company-owned and franchise-owned bottlers. Our net revenue excludes nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, is based on CSE. Operating Profit, Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis Operating profit adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit growth adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures.

(b) Amounts may not sum due to rounding. FLNA Net revenue grew 7% and volume grew 5%. The net revenue growth was primarily driven by the volume growth and effective net pricing. The volume growth primarily reflects double-digit growth in trademark Cheetos and Tostitos, and in variety packs, partially offset by a high-single-digit decline in trademark Santitas. The COVID-19 pandemic drove an increase in consumer demand, which had a positive impact on both net revenue and volume growth . Operating profit increased 4%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including a 2-percentage-point impact of certain charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Merger and integration charges related to our acquisition of BFY Brands reduced operating profit growth by 2 percentage points. 29 Table of Contents QFNA Net revenue grew 7% and volume grew 8%. The net revenue growth reflects the volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable net pricing and mix. The volume growth was broad-based across our product portfolio, and was primarily driven by double-digit growth in oatmeal, ready-to-eat cereals and trademark Roni. The COVID-19 pandemic drove an increase in consumer demand, which had a positive impact on both net revenue and volume growth . Operating profit grew 8%, reflecting the volume growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, unfavorable net pricing and higher advertising and marketing expenses. PBNA Net revenue grew 7%, driven by an increase in volume, partially offset by unfavorable net pricing. Volume increased 6%, driven by a 14% increase in non-carbonated beverage (NCB) volume and a slight increase in carbonated soft drink volume. The NCB volume increase primarily reflected double-digit increases in both our overall water portfolio and Gatorade sports drinks and a mid-single-digit increase in Lipton ready-to-drink teas. The COVID-19 pandemic drove an increase in consumer demand, which had a positive impact on both net revenue and volume growth. In addition, acquisitions contributed 1 percentage point to the net revenue growth. Operating profit decreased 24%, primarily reflecting a 27-percentage-point impact of certain charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer demand partially offset the decline in operating profit performance. In addition, o perating cost increases, including incremental information technology costs, as well as higher advertising and marketing expenses were partially offset by the volume growth and productivity savings. LatAm Net revenue increased 6%, reflecting effective net pricing and volume growth, partially offset by a 2-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Snacks volume grew 2.5%, reflecting mid-single-digit growth in Mexico, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Brazil. Beverage volume grew 5%, reflecting double-digit growth in Chile and mid-single-digit growth in Mexico, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Colombia and a low-single-digit decline in Honduras. Additionally, Brazil and Guatemala each experienced low-single-digit growth and Argentina experienced mid-single-digit growth. Operating profit increased 1%, reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 3-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. Additionally, the impact of a prior-year insurance settlement recovery related to the 2017 earthquake in Mexico reduced operating profit growth by 14 percentage points. Higher restructuring charges reduced operating profit by 2 percentage points. Europe Net revenue increased 14%, reflecting volume growth and effective net pricing. SodaStream contributed 6 percentage points to net revenue growth, which included the benefit of an extra month of sales as we aligned SodaStream’s reporting calendar with that of the Europe division. Since being acquired in the fourth quarter of 2018, SodaStream had been reporting on a one-month lag. Snacks volume grew 5%, reflecting high-single-digit growth in the United Kingdom and France, double-digit growth in Turkey and mid-single-digit growth in Poland, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline 30 Table of Contents in Russia. Additionally, the Netherlands experienced slight growth and Spain experienced low-single-digit growth. Beverage volume grew 13%, reflecting double-digit growth in France, Germany and Turkey, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Russia. Additionally, Poland experienced mid-single-digit growth and the United Kingdom experienced high-single-digit growth. Operating profit increased 28%, reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings, a 15-percentage-point impact of the prior-year inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges associated with our SodaStream acquisition and an 8-percentage-point impact of lower commodity costs, largely due to transaction-related foreign exchange. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 14-percentage-point impact of a prior-year insurance settlement recovery in Russia. AMESA Net revenue increased 9%, reflecting volume growth and effective net pricing, partially offset by a 6-percentage-point impact of a prior-year refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in India. Snacks volume grew 13%, reflecting double-digit growth in India and Pakistan. Additionally, the Middle East experienced double-digit growth and South Africa experienced mid-single-digit growth. Beverage volume grew 11%, reflecting double-digit growth in India and Nigeria. Additionally, Pakistan and the Middle East each experienced high-single-digit growth. Operating profit increased 26%, reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 5-percentage-point impact of the prior-year refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in India. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Lower restructuring and impairment charges contributed 8 percentage points to operating profit growth. APAC Net revenue increased 6%, reflecting effective net pricing and net volume growth, partially offset by a 2-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Snacks volume grew 3.5%, reflecting double-digit growth in Indonesia and mid-single-digit growth in Australia, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in China and a slight decline in Taiwan. Additionally, Thailand experienced low-single-digit growth. Beverage volume declined 2%, reflecting a mid-single-digit decline in China, partially offset by double-digit growth in the Philippines, mid-single-digit growth in Vietnam and low-single-digit growth in Thailand. Operating profit increased 33%, reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 3-percentage- point impact of lower commodity costs, partially offset by certain operating cost increases. Lower restructuring and impairment charges contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth. 31 Table of Contents Other Consolidated Results 12 Weeks Ended 3/21/2020 3/23/2019 Change Other pension and retiree medical benefits income $ 77 $ 64 $ 13 Net interest expense and other $ (290 ) $ (204 ) $ (86 ) Tax rate 21.0 % 23.9 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo $ 1,338 $ 1,413 (5 )% Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted $ 0.96 $ 1.00 (4 )% Mark-to-market net impact 0.08 (0.03 ) Restructuring and impairment charges 0.02 0.02 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges 0.02 0.01 Net tax related to the TCJ Act — (0.02 ) Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, excluding above items (a) $ 1.07 (b) $ 0.97 (b) 10 % Impact of foreign exchange translation — Growth in net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, excluding above items, on a constant currency basis (a) 10 % (a) See “Non-GAAP Measures.” (b) Does not sum due to rounding. Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $13 million , reflecting the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets and the impact of approved plan contributions, partially offset by the decrease in discount rates. Net interest expense and other increased $86 million , reflecting losses on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability, as well as lower interest income due to lower interest rates on average cash balances. These impacts were partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower interest rates on average debt balances. The reported tax rate decreased 2.9 percentage points, primarily reflecting the prior-year increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions. This impact was partially offset by the prior-year net tax related to the TCJ Act, which increased the current-year reported tax rate by 1.5 percentage points. Net income attributable to PepsiCo decreased 5% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share decreased 4% . Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) negatively impacted net income attributable to PepsiCo performance by 14 percentage points and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share performance by 15 percentage points. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. 32 Table of Contents We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; amounts associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; pension and retiree medical related items; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q are discussed below: Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, provision for income taxes and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability , operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Productivity Plan, inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges associated with our acquisitions and net tax related to the TCJ Act (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, each on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as net revenue growth adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash used for operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and 33 Table of Contents maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-Q are impacted by the following items in each of the following periods: 12 Weeks Ended 3/21/2020 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 6,127 $ 7,754 $ 5,830 $ 1,924 $ 77 $ 360 $ 1,338 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (38 ) 38 (104 ) 142 — 35 107 Restructuring and impairment charges (2 ) 2 (30 ) 32 6 6 32 Merger and integration charges — — (25 ) 25 — 3 22 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 6,087 $ 7,794 $ 5,671 $ 2,123 $ 83 $ 404 $ 1,499 12 Weeks Ended 3/23/2019 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 5,688 $ 7,196 $ 5,188 $ 2,008 $ 64 $ 446 $ 1,413 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 19 (19 ) 41 (60 ) — (14 ) (46 ) Restructuring and impairment charges (8 ) 8 (23 ) 31 (5 ) 3 23 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges (14 ) 14 (1 ) 15 — 2 13 Net tax related to the TCJ Act — — — — — 29 (29 ) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 5,685 $ 7,199 $ 5,205 $ 1,994 $ 59 $ 466 $ 1,374 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural products and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. 34 Table of Contents Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan In connection with our 2019 Productivity Plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, of which we have incurred $546 million plan to date through March 21, 2020 and cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion, of which we have incurred approximately $321 million plan to date through March 21, 2020 . We expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $400 million and cash expenditures of approximately $350 million for the remainder of 2020 , with the balance to be reflected in our 2021 through 2023 financial results. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2020 and 2021 results. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Inventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges In the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 , we recorded merger and integration charges of $25 million ($22 million after-tax or $ 0.02 per share), including $23 million in our FLNA segment related to our acquisition of BFY Brands and $2 million in our AMESA segment related to our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. These charges primarily relate to contract termination and employee-related costs . In the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019, we recorded inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges of $15 million ( $0.01 per share) in our Europe segment, primarily related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in SodaStream’s balance sheet at acquisition date . Net Tax Related to the TCJ Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. We recognized tax benefits of $29 million ($0.02 per share) in the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 related to the TCJ Act. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, bridge loan facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated share repurchases, dividend payments, debt repayments, payments for acquisitions and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper, bridge loan facilities and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially impacted by COVID-19 in the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of COVID-19 to have a material impact on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact COVID-19 may have on our business and financial results. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” as well as Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information. 35 Table of Contents As of March 21, 2020 , cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of March 21, 2020 , our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.3 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act. The CARES Act was enacted during our second quarter of 2020 and includes several significant provisions, including delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act, and estimated income tax payments that we expect to defer to future periods. We do not currently expect this legislation to have a material detrimental impact on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the CARES Act and similar legislation in other countries may have on our business and financial results. Operating Activities During the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 , net cash used for operating activities was $0.7 billion , compared to net cash used for operating activities of $0.3 billion in the prior-year period. The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects unfavorable working capital comparisons to 2019. Investing Activities During the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 , net cash used for investing activities was $0.9 billion , primarily reflecting net capital spending of $0.5 billion and acquisitions of $0.5 billion. In light of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we are currently reviewing our plans with respect to net capital spending. Financing Activities During the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 , net cash provided by financing activities was $7.5 billion , primarily reflecting proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $6.4 billion and net proceeds of short-term borrowings of $3.0 billion, partially offset by the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $1.9 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and will expire on June 30, 2021. On February 13, 2020, we announced a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.09 per share from $3.82 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2020 . We expect to return a total of approximately $7.5 billion to shareholders in 2020 through share repurchases of approximately $2 billion and dividends of approximately $5.5 billion. See Part II, “Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” for a description of our share repurchase program. 36 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow The table below reconciles net cash used for operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 12 Weeks Ended 3/21/2020 3/23/2019 Net cash used for operating activities, GAAP measure $ (749 ) $ (345 ) Capital spending (484 ) (442 ) Sales of property, plant and equipment 5 2 Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ (1,228 ) $ (785 ) We use free cash flow primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2019 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2019 Form 10-K for further information. 37 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of March 21, 2020 , the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2020 and March 23, 2019 , and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 28, 2019 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 13, 2020, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 28, 2019 , is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York April 28, 2020 38 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2019 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our first quarter of 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During our first quarter of 2020 , we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. In addition, in connection with our 2019 Productivity Plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These transitions have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 39 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. The following information should be read in conjunction with the discussion set forth under Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our 2019 Form 10-K. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2019 Form 10-K. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. The following additional risk factor relating to COVID-19 should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2019 Form 10-K. The developments described in this additional risk factor have heightened, or in some cases manifested, certain of the risks disclosed in the risk factor section of our 2019 Form 10-K, and such risk factors are further qualified by the information relating to COVID-19 that is described in this Form 10-Q, including in the additional risk factor below. Except as described herein, there have been no material changes with respect to the risk factors disclosed in our 2019 Form 10-K. You should carefully consider the risks described below and in our 2019 Form 10-K in addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q and in our 2019 Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. These risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the prices of our publicly traded securities. The risks described below and in our 2019 Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may occur or become material in the future and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the prices of our publicly traded securities. Therefore, historical operating results, financial and business performance, events and trends are often not a reliable indicator of future operating results, financial and business performance, events or trends. The impact of the spread of COVID-19 is creating significant uncertainty for our business, financial condition and results of operations and for the prices of our publicly traded securities. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which all will vary by market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic, and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. Our global operations expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in challenging operating environments. COVID-19 has spread across the globe to almost all of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Authorities in many of these markets have implemented numerous measures to stall the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, shelter in place orders, and business shutdowns. These measures have impacted and will further impact us, our customers (including our foodservice customers), consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business. There is considerable uncertainty regarding how these measures and future measures in response 40 Table of Contents to the pandemic will impact our business, including whether they will result in further changes in demand for our products, further increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs or otherwise), how they will further impact our supply chain and whether they will result in further reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, each or all of which can impact our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. In addition, measures that impact our ability to access our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or that impact the ability of our customers (including our foodservice customers), consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties to do the same, may impact the availability of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely. If a significant percentage of our or our business partners’ workforce is unable to work, including because of illness, facility closures, quarantine, curfews, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions or other governmental restrictions, our operations will be negatively impacted. Any sustained interruption in our or our business partners’ operations, distribution network or supply chain or any significant continuous shortage of raw materials or other supplies as a result of these measures, restrictions or disruptions can impair our ability to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Compliance with governmental measures imposed in response to COVID-19 has caused and may continue to cause us to incur additional costs, and any inability to comply with such measures can subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, and other penalties, any of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has amplified certain risks to our business, including increased demand on our information technology resources and systems, increased phishing and other cybersecurity attacks as cybercriminals try to exploit the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase in the number of points of potential attack, such as laptops and mobile devices (both of which are now being used in increased numbers), to be secured, and any failure to effectively manage these risks, including to timely identify and appropriately respond to any cyberattacks, may adversely affect our business. Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 impacts demand from consumers, including due to consumers not leaving their homes or otherwise shopping in a different manner than they historically have or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. As we sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories, the profile of the products we sell and the amount of revenue attributable to such products varies by jurisdiction and changes in demand as a result of COVID-19 will vary in scope and timing across these markets. In addition, changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased consumer demand for our products in subsequent quarters, or in one sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from sales of our products. For example, to date, we have seen a shift in product and channel preferences, including an increase in at-home consumption and a decrease in immediate consumption and away-from-home channels, such as convenience and gas and foodservice, which negatively impacts our beverage businesses. Any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, resulting in an inability to pay for our products, reduced or canceled orders of our products, closing of restaurants, stores, entertainment or sports complexes or other venues in which our products are sold, or our business partners’ inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such adverse changes in our customers’ or business partners’ financial condition may also result in our recording additional impairment charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice and vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. In addition, economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. 41 Table of Contents While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to try to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on our employees and our business, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the prices of our publicly traded securities may be adversely affected.

See accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 7 Table of Contents Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. Our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 7, 2019 , Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income and Equity for the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 and September 8, 2018 and the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 and September 8, 2018 have not been audited. These statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 ( 2018 Form 10-K), as modified to reflect the adoption of those recently issued accounting pronouncements disclosed in Note 2 in this Form 10-Q. This report should be read in conjunction with our 2018 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. While our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of June, July and August are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , and the months of January through August are reflected in our results for the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 . Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The following information is unaudited. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. Our Divisions We are organized into six reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada; 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada. PBNA was formerly named North America Beverages; this change did not impact the results of PBNA or our other reportable segments; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa; and 8 Table of Contents 6) Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. Net revenue and operating profit of each division are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended Net Revenue (a) 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 FLNA $ 4,105 $ 3,891 $ 11,930 $ 11,345 QFNA 576 567 1,710 1,695 PBNA 5,643 5,456 15,475 15,064 LatAm 1,904 1,868 5,031 4,935 ESSA 3,347 3,161 8,173 7,945 AMENA 1,613 1,542 4,202 4,153 Total $ 17,188 $ 16,485 $ 46,521 $ 45,137 (a) Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products to our customers, each comprising approximately 50 % of our consolidated net revenue. Internationally, our LatAm segment is predominantly a food and snack business, ESSA’s beverage business and food and snack business are each approximately 50 % of the segment’s net revenue and AMENA’s beverage business and food and snack business are approximately 35 % and 65 % , respectively, of the segment’s net revenue. Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and ESSA segments, is approximately 40 % of our consolidated net revenue. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended Operating Profit 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 FLNA $ 1,286 $ 1,241 $ 3,694 $ 3,491 QFNA 126 143 391 443 PBNA 640 703 1,719 1,838 LatAm 277 284 785 742 ESSA 474 439 965 995 AMENA (a) 357 311 883 994 Total division $ 3,160 $ 3,121 $ 8,437 $ 8,503 Corporate unallocated expenses ( 305 ) ( 277 ) ( 845 ) ( 824 ) Total $ 2,855 $ 2,844 $ 7,592 $ 7,679 (a) Operating profit for AMENA for the 36 weeks ended September 8, 2018 includes a gain of $ 144 million associated with refranchising a portion of our beverage business in Thailand. Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance related to the TCJ Act for the optional reclassification of the residual tax effects, arising from the change in corporate tax rate, in accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings. The reclassification is the difference between the amount previously recorded in other comprehensive income at the historical U.S. federal tax rate that remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the time the TCJ Act was effective and the amount that would have been recorded using the newly enacted rate. This guidance became effective during the first quarter of 2019; however, we did not elect to make the optional reclassification. In 2017, the FASB issued guidance to amend and simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance to better portray the economic results of risk management activities in the financial statements. The guidance expands the ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components, reduces complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, as well as eases certain hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. Under this guidance, certain of our 9 Table of Contents derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that did not previously qualify for hedge accounting treatment can now qualify prospectively. We adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2019; the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures. See Note 9 for further information. In 2016, the FASB issued guidance on leases, with amendments issued in 2018. The guidance requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet but does not change the manner in which expenses are recorded in the income statement. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The two permitted transition methods under the guidance are the modified retrospective transition approach, which requires application of the guidance for all comparative periods presented, and the cumulative effect adjustment approach, which requires prospective application at the adoption date. We utilized a comprehensive approach to assess the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and related disclosures, including the increase in the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and the impact on our current lease portfolio from both a lessor and lessee perspective. We completed our comprehensive review of our lease portfolio, including significant leases by geography and by asset type that were impacted by the new guidance, and enhanced our controls. In addition, we implemented a new software platform, and corresponding controls, for administering our leases and facilitating compliance with the new guidance. We adopted the guidance prospectively during the first quarter of 2019. As part of our adoption, we elected not to reassess historical lease classification, recognize short-term leases on our balance sheet, nor separate lease and non-lease components for our real estate leases. In addition, we utilized the portfolio approach to group leases with similar characteristics and did not use hindsight to determine lease term. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements, resulting in an increase of 2 % to each of our total assets and total liabilities on our balance sheet, and had an immaterial increase to retained earnings as of the beginning of 2019. See Note 13 for further information. Not Yet Adopted In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes the impairment model used to measure credit losses for most financial assets. For our trade, certain other receivables and certain other financial instruments, we will be required to use a new forward-looking expected credit loss model that will replace the existing incurred credit loss model, which would generally result in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance and do not expect it will have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures. Note 3 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. 10 Table of Contents A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 9/7/2019 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended Cost of sales $ 10 $ 100 Selling, general and administrative expenses 83 182 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 5 — Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 98 $ 282 After-tax amount $ 82 $ 225 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 0.06 $ 0.16 9/7/2019 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended Plan to Date FLNA $ 16 $ 22 $ 53 QFNA 2 2 7 PBNA 26 42 82 LatAm 22 43 52 ESSA 14 73 81 AMENA 10 63 66 Corporate 3 37 44 93 282 385 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 5 — 35 $ 98 $ 282 $ 420 9/7/2019 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended Plan to Date Severance and other employee costs $ 65 $ 105 $ 242 Asset impairments 3 87 87 Other costs (a) 30 90 91 $ 98 $ 282 $ 420 (a) Includes other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including contract termination costs, consulting and other professional fees.

The majority of the restructuring accrual at September 7, 2019 is expected to be paid by the end of 2019 . 2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 13, 2014 (2014 Productivity Plan) that includes the next generation of productivity initiatives that we believe will strengthen our beverage, food and snack businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to- 11 Table of Contents market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency. To build on the 2014 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above to further strengthen our beverage, food and snack businesses. We have substantially completed our 2014 Productivity Plan and do not expect to incur material charges in 2019 associated with this plan. The pre-tax charges and cash expenditures approximate the original total plan estimates of $ 1.3 billion and $ 960 million , respectively. For the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , there were no material charges related to this plan. Cash payments for the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 were $ 115 million . The accrual related to this plan as of September 7, 2019 is not material and the majority is expected to be paid by the end of 2019 .

Note 5 - Income Taxes Tax Cuts and Jobs Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % , effective January 1, 2018. 14 Table of Contents The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission previously issued guidance related to the TCJ Act which allowed recording of provisional tax expense using a measurement period, not to exceed one year, when information necessary to complete the accounting for the effects of the TCJ Act was not available. We elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the TCJ Act when it became effective in the fourth quarter of 2017. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result, we recognized a net tax benefit of $ 28 million ( $ 0.02 per share) for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. We recognized provisional transition tax expense of $ 76 million ( $ 0.05 per share) recorded in the 12 weeks ended September 8, 2018 and $ 854 million ( $ 0.60 per share) recorded in the 36 weeks ended September 8, 2018 . While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act as of December 29, 2018 was deemed to be complete , this amount was based on prevailing regulations and available information as of December 29, 2018, and additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. In the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019, we recognized tax benefits totaling $ 29 million ( $ 0.02 per share) in connection with the TCJ Act, including the impact of additional guidance issued by the IRS in the first quarter of 2019. For further information and discussion of the impact of the TCJ Act, refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K. Other Tax Matters On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing ( TRAF ) , effective January 1, 2020. Certain provisions of the TRAF were enacted in the third quarter of 2019, resulting in adjustments to our deferred taxes. In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019, we recorded net tax benefits of $ 45 million and $ 33 million , respectively, related to the impact of the TRAF. Enactment of the TRAF provisions subsequent to our third quarter of 2019 is expected to result in adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results. In the 12 weeks ended September 8, 2018 , we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $ 364 million ( $ 0.26 per share) resulting from the conclusion of certain international tax audits. In the second quarter of 2018, we reached an agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. The conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution with the IRS, collectively, resulted in non-cash tax benefits totaling $ 678 million ( $ 0.48 per share) in the 36 weeks ended September 8, 2018 . Note 6 - Share-Based Compensation The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 Share-based compensation expense - equity awards $ 51 $ 57 $ 169 $ 203 Share-based compensation expense - liability awards 3 2 7 4 Restructuring charges — ( 1 ) 1 1 Total $ 54 $ 58 $ 177 $ 208 For the 12 weeks ended September 7, 2019 and September 8, 2018 , our grants of stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards were nominal. 15 Table of Contents The following table summarizes share-based awards granted under the terms of the PepsiCo, Inc.

All grant activity is disclosed at target. We granted long-term cash awards to certain executive officers and other senior executives with an aggregate target value of $ 16 million and $ 21 million during the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 and September 8, 2018 , respectively. Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: 36 Weeks Ended 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 Expected life 5 years 5 years Risk-free interest rate 2.5 % 2.6 % Expected volatility 14 % 12 % Expected dividend yield 3.1 % 2.7 % Note 7 - Pension and Retiree Medical Benefits The components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and retiree medical plans are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Pension Retiree Medical 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 U.S. International Service cost $ 87 $ 99 $ 18 $ 23 $ 5 $ 7 Interest cost 125 111 24 23 9 8 Expected return on plan assets ( 205 ) ( 218 ) ( 46 ) ( 50 ) ( 4 ) ( 4 ) Amortization of prior service cost/(credits) 2 1 — — ( 4 ) ( 5 ) Amortization of net losses/(gains) 37 41 8 12 ( 7 ) ( 2 ) 46 34 4 8 ( 1 ) 4 Settlement losses 15 7 3 2 — — Special termination benefits 5 — — — — — Total $ 66 $ 41 $ 7 $ 10 $ ( 1 ) $ 4 16 Table of Contents 36 Weeks Ended Pension Retiree Medical 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 U.S. International Service cost $ 263 $ 298 $ 49 $ 63 $ 16 $ 22 Interest cost 376 333 64 63 25 24 Expected return on plan assets ( 617 ) ( 653 ) ( 124 ) ( 134 ) ( 12 ) ( 13 ) Amortization of prior service cost/(credits) 7 2 — — ( 13 ) ( 14 ) Amortization of net losses/(gains) 111 124 21 31 ( 19 ) ( 7 ) 140 104 10 23 ( 3 ) 12 Settlement losses 15 7 3 2 — — Special termination benefits — 3 — 1 — — Total $ 155 $ 114 $ 13 $ 26 $ ( 3 ) $ 12 We regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans, including the offer of an optional lump sum distribution to certain participants, which may result in settlement charges that would be reflected as an item affecting comparability in future periods. During the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , we made discretionary contributions of $ 150 million to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) in the United States and $ 17 million to our international plans. During the 36 weeks ended September 8, 2018 , we made discretionary contributions of $ 1.4 billion to Plan A in the United States, $ 17 million to our international pension plans and $ 37 million to fund U.S. retiree medical plan benefits. Note 8 - Debt Obligations In the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , we issued the following senior notes: Interest Rate Maturity Date Amount (a) 0.750 % March 2027 € 500 (b) 1.125 % March 2031 € 500 (b) 2.625 % July 2029 $ 1,000 3.375 % July 2049 $ 1,000 (a) Represents gross proceeds from issuances of long-term debt excluding debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums. (b) These notes, issued in euros, were designated as net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper. In the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , $ 3.0 billion of senior notes matured and were paid. As of September 7, 2019 , we had no commercial paper outstanding. In the second quarter of 2019, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement) which expires on June 3, 2024. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $ 0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. 17 Table of Contents Also in the second quarter of 2019, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on June 1, 2020. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement together replaced our $ 3.75 billion five-year credit agreement and our $ 3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, both dated as of June 4, 2018. Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of September 7, 2019 , there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we paid $ 1.0 billion to redeem all $ 1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of our 4.50 % senior notes due 2020. Note 9 - Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. There have been no material changes during the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 with respect to our risk management policies or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K. The notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of September 7, 2019 and December 29, 2018 are as follows: Notional Amounts (a) 9/7/2019 12/29/2018 Commodity $ 1.0 $ 1.1 Foreign exchange $ 2.0 $ 2.0 Interest rate (b) $ 5.7 $ 10.5 Net investment (c) $ 1.9 $ 0.9 (a) In billions. (b) The decrease is due to interest rate swap terminations and maturities. (c) The total notional of our net investment hedge consists of non-derivative debt instruments. As of September 7, 2019 , approximately 12 % of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 29 % as of December 29, 2018 . 18 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of September 7, 2019 and December 29, 2018 are categorized as follows: 9/7/2019 12/29/2018 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Available-for-sale debt securities (b) 2 $ 67 $ — $ 3,658 $ — Short-term investments (c) 1 $ 220 $ — $ 196 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (d) 2 $ 17 $ — $ 22 $ — Deferred compensation (e) 2 $ — $ 460 $ — $ 450 Derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments: Interest rate (f) 2 $ — $ 7 $ 1 $ 108 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 26 $ 7 $ 44 $ 14 Interest rate (g) 2 — 440 — 323 Commodity (h) 1 — 15 — 1 Commodity (i) 2 — 7 — 3 $ 26 $ 469 $ 44 $ 341 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 2 $ 9 $ 3 $ 10 Commodity (h) 1 1 20 2 17 Commodity (i) 2 1 38 5 92 $ 4 $ 67 $ 10 $ 119 Total derivatives at fair value (j) $ 30 $ 543 $ 55 $ 568 Total $ 334 $ 1,003 $ 3,931 $ 1,018 (a) Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities. (b) Based on quoted broker prices or other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. As of September 7, 2019 , these debt securities were classified as short-term investments. As of December 29, 2018 , these debt securities were primarily classified as cash equivalents. Unrealized gains and losses on our investments in debt securities as of September 7, 2019 and December 29, 2018 were not material. The decrease in available-for-sale debt securities was due to maturities during the current year. (c) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (d) Based primarily on the price of our common stock. (e) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections. (f) Based on LIBOR forward rates. As of September 7, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , the carrying amount of the hedged fixed-rate debt was $ 3.0 billion and $ 7.7 billion , respectively, and classified on our balance sheet within short-term and long-term debt obligations. As of September 7, 2019 , the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments on discontinued hedges was a $ 63 million loss, which is being amortized over the remaining life of the related debt obligations. (g) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates. (h) Based on quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. (i) Based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements. (j) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of September 7, 2019 and December 29, 2018 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions is classified as restricted cash. See Note 12 for further information. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments approximate fair value due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of September 7, 2019 and 19 Table of Contents December 29, 2018 was $ 35 billion and $ 32 billion , respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs.

Interest rate derivative losses/gains are primarily from fair value hedges and are included in interest expense. These losses/gains are substantially offset by decreases/increases in the value of the underlying debt, which are also included in interest expense. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. (b) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are included in interest expense. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. Based on current market conditions, we expect to reclassify net losses of $ 24 million related to our cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income during the next 12 months. 20 Table of Contents Note 10 - Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share The computations of basic and diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 Income Shares (a) Income Shares (a) Basic net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 1.50 $ 1.77 Net income available for PepsiCo common shareholders $ 2,100 1,397 $ 2,498 1,414 Dilutive securities: Stock options, RSUs, PSUs and Other — 8 — 10 Diluted $ 2,100 1,405 $ 2,498 1,424 Diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 1.49 $ 1.75 36 Weeks Ended 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 Income Shares (a) Income Shares (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo $ 5,548 $ 5,661 Preferred stock: (b) Redemption premium — ( 2 ) Net income available for PepsiCo common shareholders $ 5,548 1,401 $ 5,659 1,417 Basic net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 3.96 $ 3.99 Net income available for PepsiCo common shareholders $ 5,548 1,401 $ 5,659 1,417 Dilutive securities: Stock options, RSUs, PSUs and Other — 8 — 10 Employee stock ownership plan convertible preferred stock — — 2 — Diluted $ 5,548 1,409 $ 5,661 1,427 Diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 3.94 $ 3.97 (a) Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions).

We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases have remaining lease terms of one year to 20 years , some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years , and some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year . We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance). Components of lease cost are as follows: 9/7/2019 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended Operating lease cost (a) $ 115 $ 306 Variable lease cost (b) $ 29 $ 71 Short-term lease cost (c) $ 83 $ 260 (a) Includes right-of-use asset amortization of $ 101 million and $ 269 million for the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , respectively. (b) Primarily related to adjustments for inflation, common-area maintenance and property tax. (c) Not recorded on our balance sheet. Supplemental cash flow information and non-cash activity related to our operating leases are as follows: 9/7/2019 36 Weeks Ended Operating cash flow information: Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 326 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 304 Supplemental balance sheet information related to our operating leases is as follows: Balance Sheet Classification 9/7/2019 Right-of-use assets Other assets $ 1,499 Current lease liabilities Accounts payable and other current liabilities $ 412 Non-current lease liabilities Other liabilities $ 1,081 Weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases are as follows: 9/7/2019 Weighted-average remaining lease term 6 years Weighted-average discount rate 4 % 25 Table of Contents Maturities of lease liabilities by fiscal year for our operating leases are as follows: 2019 (a) $ 146 2020 450 2021 336 2022 247 2023 155 2024 and beyond 360 Total lease payments 1,694 Less: Imputed interest ( 201 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 1,493 (a) Excluding the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 .

These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material. Note 14 - Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisition of Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (Pioneer Foods) On July 19, 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Foods for 110.00 South African rand per share in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately $ 1.7 billion . The transaction is subject to a Pioneer Foods shareholder vote, certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, and closing is expected by the first quarter of 2020. Acquisition of SodaStream International Ltd. On December 5, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of SodaStream, a manufacturer and distributor of sparkling water makers, for $ 144.00 per share in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately $ 3.3 billion . The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 3.3 billion (or $ 3.2 billion , net of cash and cash equivalents acquired). 26 Table of Contents We accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date include goodwill and other intangible assets of $ 3.0 billion and property, plant and equipment of $ 0.2 billion , all of which are recorded in our ESSA segment. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to revisions, which may result in adjustments to the preliminary values discussed above as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts in the fourth quarter of 2019. Refranchising in Thailand During the second quarter of 2018, we refranchised our beverage business in Thailand by selling a controlling interest in our Thailand bottling operations to form a joint venture, where we now have an equity method investment. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 144 million ( $ 126 million after-tax or $ 0.09 per share) in selling, general and administrative expenses in our AMENA segment as a result of this transaction. 27 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL REVIEW Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Also refer to Note 1 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. Our Critical Accounting Policies The critical accounting policies below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2018 Form 10-K. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year for the expected payout. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Income Taxes In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act as of December 29, 2018 was deemed to be complete , this amount was based on prevailing regulations and available information as of December 29, 28 Table of Contents 2018, and additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. In the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019, we recognized tax benefits totaling $29 million ( $0.02 per share) in connection with the TCJ Act, including the impact of additional guidance issued by the IRS in the first quarter of 2019. On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF , effective January 1, 2020. Certain provisions of the TRAF were enacted in the third quarter of 2019, resulting in adjustments to our deferred taxes. In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019, we recorded net tax benefits of $45 million and $33 million , respectively, related to the impact of the TRAF. Enactment of the TRAF provisions subsequent to our third quarter of 2019 is expected to result in adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Our Business Risks This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q) contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: changes in demand for PepsiCo’s products, as a result of changes in consumer preferences or otherwise; changes in laws related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging of PepsiCo’s products; changes in, or failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations; imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo’s products; imposition of labeling or warning requirements on PepsiCo’s products; PepsiCo’s ability to compete effectively; failure to realize anticipated benefits from PepsiCo’s productivity initiatives or operating model; political conditions, civil unrest or other developments and risks in the markets where PepsiCo’s products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCo’s ability to grow its business in developing and emerging markets; uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; the ability to protect information systems against, or effectively respond to, a cybersecurity incident or other disruption; increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies; business disruptions; product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality, safety and integrity; damage to PepsiCo’s reputation or brand image; failure to successfully complete, integrate or manage acquisitions and joint ventures into PepsiCo’s existing operations or to complete or manage divestitures or refranchisings; changes in estimates and underlying assumptions regarding future performance that could result in an impairment charge; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws, including as a result of enactment and implementation of the TRAF, or disagreements with tax authorities; PepsiCo’s ability to recruit, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce; loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any key customer; disruption to the retail landscape, including rapid growth in hard discounters and the e-commerce channel; any downgrade or potential 29 Table of Contents downgrade of PepsiCo’s credit ratings; PepsiCo’s ability to implement shared services or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively; fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; climate change or water scarcity, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change or water scarcity; failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or strikes or work stoppages; infringement of intellectual property rights; potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other factors that may adversely affect the price of PepsiCo’s publicly traded securities and financial performance including those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2018 Form 10-K and in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In the 12 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , substantially all of our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of June, July and August . In the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , substantially all of our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January through August . In the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , our operations outside of the United States generated 41% of our consolidated net revenue, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom and China comprising approximately 19% of our consolidated net revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the 12 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 1 percentage point, reflecting declines in the euro, Turkish lira and Pakistani rupee. In the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 2 percentage points, reflecting declines in the Russian ruble, euro, Turkish lira, Argentine peso and Brazilian real. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey, and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of tariffs in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We also continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the European Union, including how the United Kingdom will interact with other European Union countries following its departure, as well as the economic, operating and political environment in Russia and the potential impact for the ESSA segment and our other businesses. Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging and encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates. We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used varies by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations 30 Table of Contents or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. Additionally, our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce capabilities, distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act as of December 29, 2018 was deemed to be complete , this amount was based on prevailing regulations and available information as of December 29, 2018, and additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. For further information on the impact of the TCJ Act, see Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K. On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF , effective January 1, 2020. Certain provisions of the TRAF were enacted in the third quarter of 2019, resulting in adjustments to our deferred taxes. In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019, we recorded net tax benefits of $45 million and $33 million , respectively, related to the impact of the TRAF. Enactment of the TRAF provisions subsequent to our third quarter of 2019 is expected to result in adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of September 7, 2019 and December 29, 2018 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of these items. Cautionary statements included above, in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” in our 2018 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. Results of Operations – Consolidated Review Consolidated Results Volume Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i.e., kilos, gallons, pounds and case sales), a common servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume. Our divisions’ physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products. For the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , total servings increased 4%. 31 Table of Contents We discuss volume for our beverage businesses on a bottler case sales (BCS) basis in which all beverage volume is converted to an 8-ounce-case metric. Most of our beverage volume is sold by our Company-owned and franchise-owned bottlers, and that portion is based on our bottlers’ sales to retailers and independent distributors. The remainder of our volume is based on our direct shipments to retailers and independent distributors. We report substantially all of our international beverage volume on a monthly calendar basis. The 12 weeks ended September 7, 2019 include beverage volume outside of North America for the months of June, July and August . The 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 include beverage volume outside of North America for the months of January through August . Concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) represent our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers, retailers and independent distributors, and is the measure upon which our revenue is based. Net Revenue and Operating Profit 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 Change 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 Change Net revenue $ 17,188 $ 16,485 4 % $ 46,521 $ 45,137 3 % Operating profit $ 2,855 $ 2,844 — % $ 7,592 $ 7,679 (1 )% Operating profit margin 16.6 % 17.3 % (0.7 ) 16.3 % 17.0 % (0.7 ) See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. 12 Weeks Operating profit increased slightly and operating profit margin decreased 0.7 percentage points. Operating profit growth was driven by net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 4-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The operating profit margin decrease primarily reflects certain operating cost increases. 36 Weeks Operating profit decreased 1% and operating profit margin decreased 0.7 percentage points. Operating profit performance was driven by certain operating cost increases, a 6-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, and higher advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by net revenue growth and productivity savings. Higher restructuring and impairment charges (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) and a prior-year gain on the refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in Thailand each negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2 percentage points. 32 Table of Contents Other Consolidated Results 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 Change 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 Change Other pension and retiree medical benefits income $ 38 $ 74 $ (36 ) $ 163 $ 231 $ (68 ) Net interest expense $ (224 ) $ (221 ) $ (3 ) $ (651 ) $ (656 ) $ 5 Tax rate (a) 21.0 % 7.0 % 21.5 % 21.5 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo $ 2,100 $ 2,498 (16 )% $ 5,548 $ 5,661 (2 )% Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted $ 1.49 $ 1.75 (15 )% $ 3.94 $ 3.97 (1 )% Mark-to-market net impact — 0.02 (0.03 ) 0.03 Restructuring and impairment charges 0.06 0.02 0.16 0.05 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges — — 0.03 — Tax (benefits)/net tax expense related to the TCJ Act (a) — 0.05 (0.02 ) 0.60 Tax benefits (a) — (0.26 ) — (0.48 ) Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, excluding above items (b) $ 1.56 (c) $ 1.59 (c) (2 )% $ 4.07 (c) $ 4.17 (c) (2 )% Impact of foreign exchange translation 1 2 Growth in net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, excluding above items, on a constant currency basis (b) (1 )% (0.5 )% (c) (a) See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information.

Net interest expense increased $3 million , reflecting lower interest income due to lower average cash balances. This impact was partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances, as well as higher gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. The reported tax rate increased 14.0 percentage points, primarily reflecting the prior-year favorable conclusion of certain international tax audits. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Net income attributable to PepsiCo decreased 16% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share decreased 15% . Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) negatively impacted both net income attributable to PepsiCo performance and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share performance by 13 percentage points. 33 Table of Contents 36 Weeks Other pension and retiree medical benefits income decreased $68 million , primarily reflecting lower expected return on plan assets due to a lower plan asset balance following the recognition of 2018 losses, higher interest costs and settlement losses in the U.S. pension plans. Net interest expense decreased $5 million , reflecting lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances, as well as higher gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. These impacts were partially offset by lower interest income due to lower average cash balances. The reported tax rate was even with the prior year, primarily reflecting the prior-year provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act, offset by the prior-year impacts of the favorable conclusion of certain international tax audits and the favorable resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Net income attributable to PepsiCo decreased 2% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share decreased 1% . Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) positively contributed 1.5 percentage points to both net income attributable to PepsiCo performance and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share performance. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; amounts associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; pension and retiree medical related items; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures are contained in this Form 10-Q: • cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree 34 Table of Contents medical benefits income, provision for income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, each adjusted for items affecting comparability ; • operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates ; • organic revenue growth; and • free cash flow. Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, provision for income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, each adjusted for items affecting comparability , operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans, inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges largely associated with our acquisition of SodaStream , tax benefits/net tax expense in connection with the TCJ Act and tax benefits (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as net revenue growth adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. We believe organic revenue provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. 35 Table of Contents Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-Q are impacted by the following items in each of the following periods: 12 Weeks Ended 9/7/2019 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 7,694 $ 9,494 $ 6,639 $ 2,855 $ 38 $ 559 $ 2,100 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (13 ) 13 9 4 — 1 3 Restructuring and impairment charges (10 ) 10 (83 ) 93 5 16 82 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges — — (7 ) 7 — 1 6 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 7,671 $ 9,517 $ 6,558 $ 2,959 $ 43 $ 577 $ 2,191 12 Weeks Ended 9/8/2018 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 7,527 $ 8,958 $ 6,114 $ 2,844 $ 188 $ 11 $ 2,498 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (31 ) 31 2 29 6 — 23 Restructuring and impairment charges — — (35 ) 35 3 1 31 Provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — (76 ) — 76 Tax benefit — — — — 364 — (364 ) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 7,496 $ 8,989 $ 6,081 $ 2,908 $ 485 $ 12 $ 2,264 36 Weeks Ended 9/7/2019 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 20,786 $ 25,735 $ 18,143 $ 7,592 $ 1,529 $ 27 $ 5,548 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 19 (19 ) 31 (50 ) (12 ) — (38 ) Restructuring and impairment charges (100 ) 100 (182 ) 282 57 4 221 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges (34 ) 34 (12 ) 46 8 — 38 Tax benefits related to the TCJ Act — — — — 29 — (29 ) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 20,671 $ 25,850 $ 17,980 $ 7,870 $ 1,611 $ 31 $ 5,740 36 Table of Contents 36 Weeks Ended 9/8/2018 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 20,445 $ 24,692 $ 17,013 $ 7,679 $ 231 $ 1,562 $ 31 $ 5,661 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (51 ) 51 (6 ) 57 — 14 — 43 Restructuring and impairment charges — — (75 ) 75 4 12 1 66 Provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — — (854 ) — 854 Tax benefits — — — — — 678 — (678 ) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 20,394 $ 24,743 $ 16,932 $ 7,811 $ 235 $ 1,412 $ 32 $ 5,946 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax benefit/charge on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural products and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan In connection with our 2019 Productivity Plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, of which we have incurred $420 million to date. We expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $200 million for the remainder of 2019 , with the balance to be reflected in our fiscal 2020 through 2023 results. These total pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 70% of severance and other employee-related costs, 15% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 15% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. We expect to incur cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion, of which we have incurred $136 million to date. We expect cash expenditures of approximately $150 million for the remainder of 2019 , with the balance to be reflected in our fiscal 2020 through 2023 cash flows. We expect to incur the majority of the pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2021 results. The total expected plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm ESSA AMENA Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 10 % 3 % 35 % 12 % 25 % 13 % 2 % 37 Table of Contents 2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We have substantially completed our 2014 Productivity Plan and do not expect to incur material charges in 2019 associated with this plan. The pre-tax charges and cash expenditures approximate the original total plan estimates of $1.3 billion and $960 million , respectively. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K for further information related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Inventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges During the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , we incurred incremental costs of $7 million ( $6 million after-tax with a nominal amount per share) in our ESSA segment and $46 million ( $38 million after-tax or $0.03 per share), including $45 million in our ESSA segment and $1 million in corporate unallocated expenses, respectively, largely associated with our acquisition of SodaStream . These incremental costs are primarily related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in SodaStream’s balance sheet at acquisition date, as well as merger and integration charges, including employee-related costs. See Note 14 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Tax Benefits/Net Tax Expense Related to the TCJ Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. In connection with the TCJ Act, we recognized tax benefits totaling $29 million ( $0.02 per share) in the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , and provisional transition tax expense of $76 million ( $0.05 per share) in the 12 weeks ended September 8, 2018 and $854 million ( $0.60 per share) in the 36 weeks ended September 8, 2018 . See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Tax Benefits In the 12 weeks ended September 8, 2018 , we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $364 million ( $0.26 per share) resulting from the conclusion of certain international tax audits. In the second quarter of 2018, we reached an agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. The conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution with the IRS, collectively, resulted in non-cash tax benefits totaling $678 million ( $0.48 per share) in the 36 weeks ended September 8, 2018 . See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Results of Operations – Division Review The results and discussions below are based on how our Chief Executive Officer monitors the performance of our divisions. See “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding non-GAAP measures. In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying 38 Table of Contents products in different package sizes and in different countries, and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. “Acquisitions and divestitures,” except as otherwise noted, reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on organic revenue growth see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 12 Weeks Ended 9/7/2019 Impact of Impact of Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure (a) Volume (b) Effective net pricing FLNA 5.5 % — — 5.5 % 2 3.5 QFNA 1.5 % — — 1 % (1 ) 2 PBNA 3.5 % — (1 ) 3 % (1 ) 3 LatAm 2 % 2 — 4 % (3 ) 7 ESSA 6 % 4 (5 ) 4 % (2 ) 6 AMENA 5 % 1 3.5 9 % 7 3 Total 4 % 1 (1 ) 4 % — 4 36 Weeks Ended 9/7/2019 Impact of Impact of Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure (a) Volume (b) Effective net pricing FLNA 5 % — — 5 % 2 3.5 QFNA 1 % — (0.5 ) 1 % (1 ) 1 PBNA 3 % — (0.5 ) 2 % (1.5 ) 4 LatAm 2 % 6 — 8 % — 7 ESSA 3 % 7 (5 ) 5 % (1 ) 6 AMENA 1 % 3 3 8 % 6 2 Total 3 % 2 (1 ) 5 % — 4 (a) Amounts may not sum due to rounding.

The volume growth reflects high-single-digit growth in trademark Doritos and Cheetos and low-single-digit growth in variety packs, partially offset by a double-digit decline in our Sabra joint venture products. Operating profit grew 4%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases. 36 Weeks Net revenue grew 5% and volume grew 1%. The net revenue growth was driven by effective net pricing and volume growth. The volume growth reflects mid-single-digit growth in trademark Doritos and Cheetos and low-single-digit growth in variety packs and trademark Ruffles, partially offset by a double-digit decline in our Sabra joint venture products. Operating profit grew 6%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases. Additionally, a prior-year bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit growth. QFNA 12 Weeks Net revenue grew 1.5% and volume declined 1%. The net revenue growth reflects favorable net pricing and mix, partially offset by the volume decline. The volume decline was driven by a high-single-digit decline in ready-to-eat cereals and a mid-single-digit decline in oatmeal, partially offset by double-digit growth in trademark Gamesa and mid-single-digit growth in Aunt Jemima syrup and mix. Operating profit decreased 12%, reflecting certain operating costs increases, a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and a 2-percentage-point prior-year impact of insurance settlement recoveries related to the 2017 earthquake in Mexico, partially offset by productivity savings and the net revenue growth. 36 Weeks Net revenue grew 1% and volume declined 1%. The net revenue growth reflects favorable net pricing and mix, partially offset by the volume decline. The volume decline was driven by mid-single-digit declines in oatmeal and ready-to-eat cereals, partially offset by double-digit growth in trademark Gamesa and mid-single-digit growth in Aunt Jemima syrup and mix. Operating profit decreased 12%, reflecting certain operating costs increases and a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, partially offset by productivity savings and the net revenue growth. PBNA 12 Weeks Net revenue increased 3.5%, primarily driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decline in volume. Acquisitions contributed 1 percentage point to the net revenue growth. Volume decreased 0.5%, driven by a 3% decline in carbonated soft drink (CSD) volume partially offset by a 3% increase in non-carbonated beverage (NCB) volume. The NCB volume increase primarily reflected a high-single-digit increase in our overall water portfolio and a low-single-digit increase in Gatorade sports drinks, partially offset by a low- 42 Table of Contents single-digit decrease in Lipton ready-to-drink teas. Acquisitions had a nominal positive contribution to the volume performance. Operating profit decreased 9%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing and productivity savings. A gain associated with the sale of an asset in the prior year negatively impacted operating profit performance by 5 percentage points and was largely offset by a gain associated with an insurance recovery in the current year, which positively contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit performance. 36 Weeks Net revenue increased 3%, primarily driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decline in volume. Acquisitions contributed 0.5 percentage points to the net revenue growth. Volume decreased 1%, driven by a 3% decline in CSD volume partially offset by a 1% increase in NCB volume. The NCB volume increase primarily reflected a high-single-digit increase in our overall water portfolio, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decrease in our juice and juice drink portfolio and low-single-digit decreases in Lipton ready-to-drink teas and Gatorade sports drinks. Acquisitions had a nominal positive contribution to the volume performance. Operating profit decreased 6%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses, a 7-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and the volume decline. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing and productivity savings. Gains associated with the sale of assets in the prior year negatively impacted operating profit performance by 3 percentage points and were partially offset by a current-year gain associated with a sale of an asset, which positively contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit performance. A gain associated with an insurance recovery positively contributed 2 percentage points to current-year operating profit performance and was partially offset by less-favorable insurance adjustments compared to the prior year, which negatively impacted the current-year operating profit performance by 1.5 percentage points. Additionally, a prior-year bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act positively contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit performance. LatAm 12 Weeks Net revenue increased 2%, reflecting effective net pricing, partially offset by a net decline in volume and a 2-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Snacks volume declined 3%, reflecting a double-digit decline in Brazil, partially offset by low-single-digit growth in Mexico. Beverage volume grew 5%, reflecting high-single-digit growth in Brazil and double-digit growth in Guatemala, partially offset by a high-single-digit decline in Colombia and a low-single-digit decline in Argentina. Additionally, Mexico experienced mid-single-digit growth and Honduras experienced low-single-digit growth. Operating profit decreased 3%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, the net volume decline and a 12-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs largely due to transaction-related foreign exchange, partially offset by the effective net pricing and productivity savings.

Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated share repurchases, dividend payments, debt repayments, our proposed acquisition of Pioneer Foods and transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2018 Form 10-K for further information. As of September 7, 2019 , we had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the United States of $3.2 billion, including restricted cash held outside the United States of approximately $0.1 billion related to our acquisition of SodaStream. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of restricted cash. As of September 7, 2019 , cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of September 7, 2019 , our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.4 billion. This transition tax liability will be paid over the remaining seven years. Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act. Operating Activities During the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , net cash provided by operating activities was $5.1 billion , compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $4.7 billion in the prior-year period. The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects prior-year discretionary contributions of $1.5 billion to our pension and retiree medical plans, partially offset by higher net cash tax payments in the current year. Investing Activities During the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , net cash used for investing activities was $4.3 billion , primarily reflecting $1.9 billion of cash paid in connection with our acquisition of SodaStream, as well as net capital spending of $1.9 billion. We expect 2019 net capital spending to be approximately $4.5 billion . Financing Activities During the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2019 , net cash used for financing activities was $5.8 billion , primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $6.2 billion and payments of long-term debt borrowings of $3.0 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $3.1 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 13, 2018, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and will expire on June 30, 2021. In addition, on February 15, 2019, we announced a 3% increase in our annualized 46 Table of Contents dividend to $3.82 per share from $3.71 per share, effective with the dividend paid in June 2019. We expect to return a total of approximately $8 billion to shareholders in 2019 through share repurchases of approximately $3 billion and dividends of approximately $5 billion. See Part II, “Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” for a description of our share repurchase program. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.” The table below reconciles net cash used for operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. 36 Weeks Ended 9/7/2019 9/8/2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,063 $ 4,732 Capital spending (1,959 ) (1,578 ) Sales of property, plant and equipment 63 119 Free cash flow $ 3,167 $ 3,273 We use free cash flow primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2018 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2018 Form 10-K for further information. 47 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 7, 2019 , the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income and Equity for the twelve and thirty-six week periods ended September 7, 2019 and September 8, 2018 , the related Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the thirty-six week periods ended September 7, 2019 and September 8, 2018 , and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 29, 2018 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 15, 2019, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 29, 2018 , is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York October 3, 2019 48 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our third fiscal quarter of 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During our third fiscal quarter of 2019 , we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These transitions have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 49 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. The following information should be read in conjunction with the discussion set forth under Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our 2018 Form 10-K and Part II, “Item 1.

See accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 7 Table of Contents Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. Our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 15, 2019 , Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income and Equity for the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 and June 16, 2018 and the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 and June 16, 2018 have not been audited. These statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 ( 2018 Form 10-K), as modified to reflect the adoption of those recently issued accounting pronouncements disclosed in Note 2 in this Form 10-Q. This report should be read in conjunction with our 2018 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. While our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of March, April and May are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , and the months of January through May are reflected in our results for the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 . Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The following information is unaudited. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. Our Divisions We are organized into six reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada; 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada. PBNA was formerly named North America Beverages; this change did not impact the results of PBNA or our other reportable segments; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa; and 8 Table of Contents 6) Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. Net revenue and operating profit of each division are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended Net Revenue (a) 6/15/2019 6/16/2018 6/15/2019 6/16/2018 FLNA $ 4,010 $ 3,837 $ 7,825 $ 7,454 QFNA 540 527 1,134 1,128 PBNA 5,322 5,193 9,832 9,608 LatAm 1,886 1,843 3,127 3,067 ESSA 3,133 3,116 4,826 4,784 AMENA 1,558 1,574 2,589 2,611 Total $ 16,449 $ 16,090 $ 29,333 $ 28,652 (a) Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products to our customers, each comprising approximately 50 % of our consolidated net revenue. Internationally, our LatAm segment is predominantly a food and snack business, ESSA’s beverage business and food and snack business are each approximately 50 % of the segment’s net revenue and AMENA’s beverage business and food and snack business are approximately 35 % and 65 % , respectively, of the segment’s net revenue. Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and ESSA segments, is approximately 40 % of our consolidated net revenue. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended Operating Profit 6/15/2019 6/16/2018 6/15/2019 6/16/2018 FLNA $ 1,249 $ 1,200 $ 2,408 $ 2,250 QFNA 127 145 265 300 PBNA 690 747 1,079 1,135 LatAm 278 269 508 458 ESSA 366 438 491 556 AMENA (a) 325 496 526 683 Total division $ 3,035 $ 3,295 $ 5,277 $ 5,382 Corporate unallocated expenses ( 306 ) ( 267 ) ( 540 ) ( 547 ) Total $ 2,729 $ 3,028 $ 4,737 $ 4,835 (a) Operating profit for AMENA for the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 16, 2018 includes a gain of $ 144 million associated with refranchising a portion of our beverage business in Thailand. Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance related to the TCJ Act for the optional reclassification of the residual tax effects, arising from the change in corporate tax rate, in accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings. The reclassification is the difference between the amount previously recorded in other comprehensive income at the historical U.S. federal tax rate that remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the time the TCJ Act was effective and the amount that would have been recorded using the newly enacted rate. This guidance became effective during the first quarter of 2019; however, we did not elect to make the optional reclassification. In 2017, the FASB issued guidance to amend and simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance to better portray the economic results of risk management activities in the financial statements. The guidance expands the ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components, reduces complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, as well as eases certain hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. Under this guidance, certain of our 9 Table of Contents derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that did not previously qualify for hedge accounting treatment can now qualify prospectively. We adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2019; the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures. See Note 9 for further information. In 2016, the FASB issued guidance on leases, with amendments issued in 2018. The guidance requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet but does not change the manner in which expenses are recorded in the income statement. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The two permitted transition methods under the guidance are the modified retrospective transition approach, which requires application of the guidance for all comparative periods presented, and the cumulative effect adjustment approach, which requires prospective application at the adoption date. We utilized a comprehensive approach to assess the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and related disclosures, including the increase in the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and the impact on our current lease portfolio from both a lessor and lessee perspective. We completed our comprehensive review of our lease portfolio, including significant leases by geography and by asset type that were impacted by the new guidance, and enhanced our controls. In addition, we implemented a new software platform, and corresponding controls, for administering our leases and facilitating compliance with the new guidance. We adopted the guidance prospectively during the first quarter of 2019. As part of our adoption, we elected not to reassess historical lease classification, recognize short-term leases on our balance sheet, nor separate lease and non-lease components for our real estate leases. In addition, we utilized the portfolio approach to group leases with similar characteristics and did not use hindsight to determine lease term. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements, resulting in an increase of 2 % to each of our total assets and total liabilities on our balance sheet, and had an immaterial increase to retained earnings as of the beginning of 2019.

To build on the 2014 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded and extended the program through the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above to further strengthen our beverage, food and snack businesses. We have substantially completed our 2014 Productivity Plan and do not expect to incur material charges in 2019 associated with this program. We expect pre-tax charges and cash expenditures for the program to approximate the total program estimates of $ 1.3 billion and $ 960 million , respectively. 11 Table of Contents For the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , there were no material charges related to this program. Cash payments for the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 were $ 89 million . The accrual related to this program as of June 15, 2019 is immaterial and is expected to be paid by the end of 2019 .

Note 5 - Income Taxes Tax Cuts and Jobs Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % , effective January 1, 2018. 14 Table of Contents The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission previously issued guidance related to the TCJ Act which allowed recording of provisional tax expense using a measurement period, not to exceed one year, when information necessary to complete the accounting for the effects of the TCJ Act was not available. We elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the TCJ Act when it became effective in the fourth quarter of 2017. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result, we recognized a net tax benefit of $ 28 million ( $ 0.02 per share) for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, which included provisional transition tax expense of $ 777 million ( $ 0.54 per share) recorded in the 12 weeks ended June 16, 2018 and $ 778 million ( $ 0.54 per share) recorded in the 24 weeks ended June 16, 2018 . While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act as of December 29, 2018 was deemed to be complete , this amount was based on prevailing regulations and available information as of December 29, 2018, and additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. In the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019, we recognized tax benefits totaling $ 29 million ( $ 0.02 per share) in connection with the TCJ Act, including the impact of additional guidance issued by the IRS in the first quarter of 2019. For further information and discussion of the impact of the TCJ Act, refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K. Other Tax Matters In a referendum held on May 19, 2019, Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing ( TRAF ) , effective January 1, 2020. The TRAF did not have a material impact on our business and financial results for the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 . Enactment of TRAF provisions subsequent to our second quarter of 2019 is expected to result in adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results. In the second quarter of 2018, we reached an agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. The agreement resulted in a non-cash tax benefit totaling $ 314 million ( $ 0.22 per share) in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 16, 2018 . Note 6 - Share-Based Compensation The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/15/2019 6/16/2018 6/15/2019 6/16/2018 Share-based compensation expense - equity awards $ 61 $ 66 $ 118 $ 146 Share-based compensation expense - liability awards 3 ( 4 ) 4 2 Restructuring charges 1 ( 1 ) 1 2 Total $ 65 $ 61 $ 123 $ 150 For the 12 weeks ended June 15, 2019 and June 16, 2018 , our grants of stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards were nominal. 15 Table of Contents The following table summarizes share-based awards granted under the terms of the PepsiCo, Inc.

We regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. During the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , we made discretionary contributions of $ 150 million to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) in the United States and $ 17 million to our international plans. During the 24 weeks ended June 16, 2018 , we made discretionary contributions of $ 1.4 billion to Plan A in the United States and $ 17 million to our international plans. Note 8 - Debt Obligations In the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , we issued the following senior notes: Interest Rate Maturity Date Amount (a) 0.750 % March 2027 € 500 (b) 1.125 % March 2031 € 500 (b) (a) Represents gross proceeds from issuances of long-term debt excluding debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums. (b) These notes, issued in euros, were designated as net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes. In the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , $ 3.0 billion of senior notes matured and were paid. As of June 15, 2019 , we had $ 0.6 billion of commercial paper outstanding. In the second quarter of 2019, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement) which expires on June 3, 2024. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $ 0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. Also in the second quarter of 2019, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on June 1, 2020. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which would mature no 17 Table of Contents later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement together replaced our $ 3.75 billion five-year credit agreement and our $ 3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, both dated as of June 4, 2018. Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of June 15, 2019 , there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement. Note 9 - Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. There have been no material changes during the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 with respect to our risk management policies or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K.

(b) Primarily relates to collateral posted against our derivative asset or liability positions. Note 13 - Leases Lessee We determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases have remaining lease terms of one year to 20 years , some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years , and some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year . We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use assets 23 Table of Contents and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance). Components of lease cost are as follows: 6/15/2019 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended Operating lease cost (a) $ 106 $ 191 Variable lease cost (b) $ 23 $ 42 Short-term lease cost (c) $ 93 $ 177 (a) Includes right-of-use asset amortization of $ 94 million and $ 168 million for the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , respectively. (b) Primarily related to adjustments for inflation, common-area maintenance and property tax. (c) Not recorded on our balance sheet. Supplemental cash flow information and non-cash activity related to our operating leases are as follows: 6/15/2019 24 Weeks Ended Operating cash flow information: Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 206 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 170 Supplemental balance sheet information related to our operating leases is as follows: Balance Sheet Classification 6/15/2019 Right-of-use assets Other assets $ 1,473 Current lease liabilities Accounts payable and other current liabilities $ 400 Non-current lease liabilities Other liabilities $ 1,071 Weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases are as follows: 6/15/2019 Weighted-average remaining lease term 5 years Weighted-average discount rate 4 % Maturities of lease liabilities by fiscal year for our operating leases are as follows: 2019 (a) $ 245 2020 421 2021 315 2022 229 2023 139 2024 and beyond 320 Total lease payments 1,669 Less: Imputed interest ( 198 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 1,471 (a) Excluding the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 . 24 Table of Contents As of December 29, 2018 , minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases by period were expected to be as follows: 2019 $ 459 2020 406 2021 294 2022 210 2023 161 2024 and beyond 310 Total $ 1,840 A summary of rent expense for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 is as follows: 2018 2017 Rent expense $ 771 $ 742 Lessor We have various arrangements for certain foodservice and vending equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material. Note 14 - Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisition of SodaStream International Ltd. On December 5, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of SodaStream, a manufacturer and distributor of sparkling water makers, for $ 144.00 per share in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately $ 3.3 billion . The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 3.3 billion (or $ 3.2 billion , net of cash and cash equivalents acquired), including $ 0.1 billion of consideration held by our paying agent in connection with this acquisition and reported as restricted cash as of June 15, 2019 . We accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date include goodwill and other intangible assets of $ 3.0 billion and property, plant and equipment of $ 0.2 billion , all of which are recorded in our ESSA segment. During the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , we incurred incremental costs of $ 24 million ( $ 19 million after-tax or $ 0.01 per share) (including $ 23 million in our ESSA segment and $ 1 million in corporate unallocated expenses) and $ 39 million ( $ 32 million after-tax or $ 0.02 per share) (including $ 38 million in our ESSA segment and $ 1 million in corporate unallocated expenses), respectively. These incremental costs are primarily related to inventory fair value adjustments, as well as merger and integration charges, including employee-related costs. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to revisions, which may result in adjustments to the preliminary values discussed above as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible, but no later than the end of 2019. Refranchising in Thailand During the second quarter of 2018, we refranchised our beverage business in Thailand by selling a controlling interest in our Thailand bottling operations to form a joint venture, where we now have an equity method investment. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 144 million ( $ 126 million after-tax or $ 0.09 per share) in selling, general and administrative expenses in our AMENA segment as a result of this transaction. 25 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL REVIEW Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Also refer to Note 1 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. Our Critical Accounting Policies The critical accounting policies below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2018 Form 10-K. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year for the expected payout. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Income Taxes In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act as of December 29, 2018 was deemed to be complete , this amount was based on prevailing regulations and available information as of December 29, 26 Table of Contents 2018, and additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. In the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019, we recognized tax benefits totaling $29 million ( $0.02 per share) in connection with the TCJ Act, including the impact of additional guidance issued by the IRS in the first quarter of 2019. In a referendum held on May 19, 2019, Switzerland passed TRAF , effective January 1, 2020. The TRAF did not have a material impact on our business and financial results for the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 . Enactment of TRAF provisions subsequent to our second quarter of 2019 is expected to result in adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Our Business Risks This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q) contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: changes in demand for PepsiCo’s products, as a result of changes in consumer preferences or otherwise; changes in laws related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging of PepsiCo’s products; changes in, or failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations; imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo’s products; imposition of labeling or warning requirements on PepsiCo’s products; PepsiCo’s ability to compete effectively; failure to realize anticipated benefits from PepsiCo’s productivity initiatives or operating model; political conditions, civil unrest or other developments and risks in the markets where PepsiCo’s products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCo’s ability to grow its business in developing and emerging markets; uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; the ability to protect information systems against, or effectively respond to, a cybersecurity incident or other disruption; increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies; business disruptions; product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality, safety and integrity; damage to PepsiCo’s reputation or brand image; failure to successfully complete, integrate or manage acquisitions and joint ventures into PepsiCo’s existing operations or to complete or manage divestitures or refranchisings; changes in estimates and underlying assumptions regarding future performance that could result in an impairment charge; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws, including as a result of enactment and implementation of the TRAF, or disagreements with tax authorities; PepsiCo’s ability to recruit, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce; loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any key customer; disruption to the retail landscape, including rapid growth in hard discounters and the e-commerce channel; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCo’s credit ratings; PepsiCo’s ability to implement shared services or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively; fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; climate change 27 Table of Contents or water scarcity, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change or water scarcity; failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or strikes or work stoppages; infringement of intellectual property rights; potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other factors that may adversely affect the price of PepsiCo’s publicly traded securities and financial performance including those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2018 Form 10-K and in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In the 12 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , substantially all of our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of March, April and May . In the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , substantially all of our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January through May . In the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , our operations outside of the United States generated 40% of our consolidated net revenue, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom and China comprising approximately 19% of our consolidated net revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In each of the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 3 percentage points, primarily due to declines in the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, euro, Argentine peso and Brazilian real. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey, and currency fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of tariffs in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We also continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the European Union, including how the United Kingdom will interact with other European Union countries following its departure, as well as the economic, operating and political environment in Russia and the potential impact for the ESSA segment and our other businesses. Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging and encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates. We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used varies by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations 28 Table of Contents or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. Additionally, our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce capabilities, distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act as of December 29, 2018 was deemed to be complete , this amount was based on prevailing regulations and available information as of December 29, 2018, and additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. For further information on the impact of the TCJ Act, see Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K. In a referendum held on May 19, 2019, Switzerland passed TRAF , effective January 1, 2020. The TRAF did not have a material impact on our business and financial results for the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 . Enactment of TRAF provisions subsequent to our second quarter of 2019 is expected to result in adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of June 15, 2019 and December 29, 2018 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of these items. Cautionary statements included above, in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” in our 2018 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. Results of Operations – Consolidated Review Consolidated Results Volume Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i.e., kilos, gallons, pounds and case sales), a common servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume. Our divisions’ physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products. For the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , total servings increased 3% and 3.5%, respectively. We discuss volume for our beverage businesses on a bottler case sales (BCS) basis in which all beverage volume is converted to an 8-ounce-case metric. Most of our beverage volume is sold by our Company-owned and franchise-owned bottlers, and that portion is based on our bottlers’ sales to retailers and independent distributors. The remainder of our volume is based on our direct shipments to retailers and independent distributors. We report substantially all of our international beverage volume on a monthly calendar basis. The 12 weeks ended June 15, 2019 include beverage volume outside of North America for the months of March, April and May . The 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 include beverage volume outside of North America 29 Table of Contents for the months of January through May . Concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) represent our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers, retailers and independent distributors, and is the measure upon which our revenue is based. Net Revenue and Operating Profit 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/15/2019 6/16/2018 Change 6/15/2019 6/16/2018 Change Net revenue $ 16,449 $ 16,090 2 % $ 29,333 $ 28,652 2 % Operating profit $ 2,729 $ 3,028 (10 )% $ 4,737 $ 4,835 (2 )% Operating profit margin 16.6 % 18.8 % (2.2 ) 16.1 % 16.9 % (0.8 ) See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. 12 Weeks Operating profit decreased 10% and operating profit margin decreased 2.2 percentage points. Operating profit performance was driven by certain operating cost increases, a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, and higher advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by effective net pricing and productivity savings. Higher restructuring and impairment charges (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) and a prior-year gain on the refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in Thailand each negatively impacted operating profit performance by 5 percentage points. 24 Weeks Operating profit decreased 2% and operating profit margin decreased 0.8 percentage points. Operating profit performance was driven by certain operating cost increases, a 6-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, and higher advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by net revenue growth and productivity savings. Higher restructuring and impairment charges (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) and a prior-year gain on the refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in Thailand negatively impacted operating profit performance by 4 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively. A prior-year bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act positively contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit performance. 30 Table of Contents Other Consolidated Results 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/15/2019 6/16/2018 Change 6/15/2019 6/16/2018 Change Other pension and retiree medical benefits income $ 61 $ 82 $ (21 ) $ 125 $ 157 $ (32 ) Net interest expense $ (223 ) $ (210 ) $ (13 ) $ (427 ) $ (435 ) $ 8 Tax rate (a) 20.4 % 36.9 % 21.9 % 30.2 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo $ 2,035 $ 1,820 12 % $ 3,448 $ 3,163 9 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted $ 1.44 $ 1.28 13 % $ 2.44 $ 2.21 10 % Mark-to-market net impact — — (0.03 ) 0.01 Restructuring and impairment charges 0.08 0.02 0.10 0.02 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges 0.01 — 0.02 — Tax benefit (a) — (0.22 ) — (0.22 ) Tax (benefits)/net tax expense related to the TCJ Act (a) — 0.54 (0.02 ) 0.54 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, excluding above items (b) $ 1.54 (c) $ 1.61 (c) (4 )% $ 2.52 (c) $ 2.58 (c) (2 )% Impact of foreign exchange translation 2 2 Growth in net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, excluding above items, on a constant currency basis (b) (2 )% — % (a) See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. (b) See “Non-GAAP Measures.” (c) Does not sum due to rounding. 12 Weeks Other pension and retiree medical benefits income decreased $21 million , primarily reflecting lower expected return on plan assets due to a lower plan asset balance following the recognition of 2018 losses and higher interest costs in the U.S. pension plans. Net interest expense increased $13 million , reflecting lower interest income due to lower average cash balances, as well as lower gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. These impacts were partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances. The reported tax rate decreased 16.5 percentage points, primarily as a result of the prior-year provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act, partially offset by the prior-year favorable resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Net income attributable to PepsiCo increased 12% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share increased 13% . Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) contributed 17 percentage points to net income attributable to PepsiCo growth and 18 percentage points to net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share growth. 31 Table of Contents 24 Weeks Other pension and retiree medical benefits income decreased $32 million , primarily reflecting lower expected return on plan assets due to a lower plan asset balance following the recognition of 2018 losses and higher interest costs in the U.S. pension plans. Net interest expense decreased $8 million , reflecting lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances, as well as higher gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. These impacts were partially offset by lower interest income due to lower average cash balances. The reported tax rate decreased 8.3 percentage points, primarily as a result of the prior-year provisional net tax expense and current-year tax benefits both related to the TCJ Act. These impacts were partially offset by the prior-year favorable resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Net income attributable to PepsiCo increased 9% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share increased 10% . Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) contributed 13 percentage points to both net income attributable to PepsiCo growth and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share growth. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring programs; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; amounts associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; pension and retiree medical related items; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures are contained in this Form 10-Q: • cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, provision for income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, each adjusted for items affecting comparability ; 32 Table of Contents • operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates ; • organic revenue growth; and • free cash flow. Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, provision for income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, each adjusted for items affecting comparability , operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans, inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges associated with our acquisition of SodaStream, tax benefits/net tax expense in connection with the TCJ Act and a tax benefit (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as net revenue growth adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. We believe organic revenue provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. 33 Table of Contents Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-Q are impacted by the following items in each of the following periods: 12 Weeks Ended 6/15/2019 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 7,404 $ 9,045 $ 6,316 $ 2,729 $ 524 $ 8 $ 2,035 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 13 (13 ) (19 ) 6 1 — 5 Restructuring and impairment charges (82 ) 82 (76 ) 158 38 4 116 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges (20 ) 20 (4 ) 24 5 — 19 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 7,315 $ 9,134 $ 6,217 $ 2,917 $ 568 $ 12 $ 2,175 12 Weeks Ended 6/16/2018 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 7,263 $ 8,827 $ 5,799 $ 3,028 $ 1,070 $ 1,820 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 7 (7 ) (4 ) (3 ) 1 (4 ) Restructuring and impairment charges — — (32 ) 32 8 24 Provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — (777 ) 777 Tax benefit — — — — 314 (314 ) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 7,270 $ 8,820 $ 5,763 $ 3,057 $ 616 $ 2,303 24 Weeks Ended 6/15/2019 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 13,092 $ 16,241 $ 11,504 $ 4,737 $ 125 $ 970 $ 17 $ 3,448 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 32 (32 ) 22 (54 ) — (13 ) — (41 ) Restructuring and impairment charges (90 ) 90 (99 ) 189 (5 ) 41 4 139 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges (34 ) 34 (5 ) 39 — 7 — 32 Tax benefits related to the TCJ Act — — — — — 29 — (29 ) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 13,000 $ 16,333 $ 11,422 $ 4,911 $ 120 $ 1,034 $ 21 $ 3,549 34 Table of Contents 24 Weeks Ended 6/16/2018 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 12,918 $ 15,734 $ 10,899 $ 4,835 $ 157 $ 1,374 $ 3,163 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (20 ) 20 (8 ) 28 — 8 20 Restructuring and impairment charges — — (40 ) 40 4 9 35 Provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — — (778 ) 778 Tax benefit — — — — — 314 (314 ) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 12,898 $ 15,754 $ 10,851 $ 4,903 $ 161 $ 927 $ 3,682 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax benefit/charge on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan In connection with our 2019 Productivity Plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, of which we have incurred $322 million to date. We expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $450 million for the remainder of 2019 , with the balance to be reflected in our fiscal 2020 through 2023 results. These total pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 70% of severance and other employee-related costs, 15% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 15% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. We expect to incur cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion, of which we have incurred $66 million to date. We expect cash expenditures of approximately $300 million for the remainder of 2019 , with the balance to be reflected in our fiscal 2020 through 2023 cash flows. We expect to incur the majority of the pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2021 results. The total expected program pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm ESSA AMENA Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 10 % 3 % 35 % 12 % 25 % 13 % 2 % 2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We have substantially completed our 2014 Productivity Plan and do not expect to incur material charges in 2019 associated with this program. We expect pre-tax charges and cash expenditures for the program to approximate the total program estimates of $1.3 billion and $960 million , respectively. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our 35 Table of Contents consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K for further information related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Inventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges During the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , we incurred incremental costs of $24 million ( $19 million after-tax or $0.01 per share) (including $23 million in our ESSA segment and $1 million in corporate unallocated expenses) and $39 million ( $32 million after-tax or $0.02 per share) (including $38 million in our ESSA segment and $1 million in corporate unallocated expenses), respectively, related to our acquisition of SodaStream. These incremental costs are primarily related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in SodaStream’s balance sheet at acquisition date, as well as merger and integration charges, including employee-related costs. See Note 14 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Tax Benefits/Net Tax Expense Related to the TCJ Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. In connection with the TCJ Act, we recognized tax benefits totaling $29 million ( $0.02 per share) in the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , and provisional transition tax expense of $777 million ( $0.54 per share) in the 12 weeks ended June 16, 2018 and $778 million ( $0.54 per share) in the 24 weeks ended June 16, 2018 . See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Tax Benefit During the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 16, 2018 , we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $314 million ($0.22 per share) associated with our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Results of Operations – Division Review The results and discussions below are based on how our Chief Executive Officer monitors the performance of our divisions. See “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding non-GAAP measures. In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries, and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. “Acquisitions and divestitures,” except as otherwise noted, reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. 36 Table of Contents Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Operating profit grew 7%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases. Additionally, a prior-year bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth. QFNA 12 Weeks Net revenue grew 2.5% and volume grew slightly. The net revenue growth reflects favorable net pricing, mix and volume growth. The volume growth was driven by double-digit growth in trademark Gamesa, mid-single-digit growth in Aunt Jemima syrup and mix and ready-to-eat cereals, partially offset by a high-single-digit decline in oatmeal. Operating profit decreased 12%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and a 2-percentage-point prior-year impact of insurance settlement recoveries related to the 2017 earthquake in Mexico, partially offset by productivity savings and the net revenue growth. 24 Weeks Net revenue grew 1% and volume declined slightly. The net revenue growth reflects favorable net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume and mix. The volume decline was driven by mid-single-digit declines in oatmeal and ready-to-eat cereals, partially offset by double-digit growth in trademark Gamesa and mid-single-digit growth in Aunt Jemima syrup and mix. Operating profit decreased 12%, reflecting certain operating cost increases and a 5.5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, partially offset by productivity savings. PBNA 12 Weeks Net revenue increased 2.5%, driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decline in volume. Acquisitions contributed 0.5 percentage points to the net revenue growth. Volume decreased 2%, driven by a 3% decline in carbonated soft drink (CSD) volume and a 1% decline in non-carbonated beverage volume. The non-carbonated beverage volume decrease primarily reflected mid-single-digit decreases in Gatorade sports drinks and in our juice and juice drinks portfolio, partially offset by a mid-single-digit increase in our overall water portfolio. 40 Table of Contents Operating profit decreased 8%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses, a 6-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and the volume decline. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing and productivity savings. A current-year gain associated with a sale of an asset positively contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit performance and was offset by less-favorable insurance adjustments compared to the prior year, which negatively impacted the current-year operating profit performance by 4 percentage points. 24 Weeks Net revenue increased 2%, driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decline in volume. Acquisitions had a nominal impact to the net revenue growth. Volume decreased 2%, driven by a 3% decline in CSD volume. Non-carbonated beverage volume decreased slightly, reflecting a low-single-digit decrease in Gatorade sports drinks and a mid-single-digit decrease in our juice and juice drinks portfolio, mostly offset by a mid-single-digit increase in our overall water portfolio. Operating profit decreased 5%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, a 9-percentage-point-impact of higher commodity costs, higher advertising and marketing expenses and the volume decline. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing and productivity savings. Less-favorable insurance adjustments compared to the prior year negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2.5 percentage points. A current-year gain associated with a sale of an asset positively contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit performance and was partially offset by a gain associated with the sale of an asset in the prior year, which negatively impacted operating profit performance by 1.5 percentage points. Additionally, a prior-year bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act positively contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit performance. LatAm 12 Weeks Net revenue increased 2%, reflecting effective net pricing and volume growth, partially offset by a 7-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Snacks volume grew 4%, reflecting double-digit growth in Brazil and low-single-digit growth in Mexico.

Operating profit decreased 12%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, a 17-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs largely due to transaction-related foreign exchange, a 10-percentage-point impact of restructuring and impairment charges and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by the net revenue growth and productivity savings. The SodaStream acquisition positively 42 Table of Contents contributed 8 percentage points to operating profit performance and was partially offset by inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges which negatively impacted operating profit performance by 6 percentage points. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 10 percentage points. AMENA 12 Weeks Net revenue decreased 1%, reflecting a 4-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and a 1-percentage-point impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in India in 2019, partially offset by volume growth and effective net pricing. Snacks volume grew 6%, reflecting double-digit growth in Pakistan and high-single-digit growth in the Middle East. Additionally, Australia experienced low-single-digit growth and India and China each experienced mid-single-digit growth. Beverage volume grew 1%, reflecting high-single-digit growth in India, double-digit growth in Vietnam and mid-single-digit growth in the Philippines, partially offset by a high-single-digit decline in the Middle East, a mid-single-digit decline in China and a low-single-digit decline in Pakistan. Operating profit decreased 34%, reflecting a 29-percentage-point impact of a gain on the prior-year refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in Thailand, certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 3-percentage-point-impact of higher commodity costs. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings, the volume growth and the effective net pricing. Higher restructuring and impairment charges and unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 8 percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively. 24 Weeks Net revenue decreased 1%, reflecting a 4.5-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and a 3-percentage-point impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in India in 2019 and in Thailand in 2018, partially offset by volume growth and effective net pricing. Snacks volume grew 5%, reflecting double-digit growth in China and Pakistan. Additionally, the Middle East, Australia and India each experienced mid-single-digit growth. Beverage volume grew 1%, reflecting double-digit growth in Vietnam and Philippines and low-single-digit growth in India, partially offset by a high-single-digit decline in the Middle East, a low-single-digit decline in Pakistan and a slight decline in China. Operating profit decreased 23%, reflecting a 21-percentage-point impact of the gain on the prior-year refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in Thailand, certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 3-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. These impacts were partially offset by the volume growth, productivity savings and the effective net pricing. Higher restructuring and impairment charges and unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 7 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively. 43 Table of Contents Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated share repurchases, dividend payments, debt repayments and transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2018 Form 10-K for further information. As of June 15, 2019 , we had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the United States of $3.0 billion, including restricted cash held outside the United States of approximately $0.1 billion related to our acquisition of SodaStream. See Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of restricted cash. As of June 15, 2019 , cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of June 15, 2019 , our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.4 billion. Under the provisions of the TCJ Act, this transition tax liability must be paid over eight years. Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act. Operating Activities During the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion , compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1.1 billion in the prior-year period. The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects discretionary contributions of $1.6 billion to our pension and retiree medical plans in the prior year, partially offset by unfavorable net working capital comparisons to 2018 and higher net cash tax payments in the current year. Investing Activities During the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , net cash used for investing activities was $3.3 billion , primarily reflecting $1.9 billion of cash paid in connection with our acquisition of SodaStream, as well as net capital spending of $1.1 billion. We expect 2019 net capital spending to be approximately $4.5 billion . Financing Activities During the 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 , net cash used for financing activities was $5.4 billion , primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $4.4 billion and payments of long-term debt borrowings of $3.0 billion , partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $ 1.1 billion and net proceeds of short-term borrowings of $0.7 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 13, 2018, we announced a share repurchase program providing for 44 Table of Contents the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and will expire on June 30, 2021. In addition, on February 15, 2019, we announced a 3% increase in our annualized dividend to $3.82 per share from $3.71 per share, effective with the dividend paid in June 2019. We expect to return a total of approximately $8 billion to shareholders in 2019 through share repurchases of approximately $3 billion and dividends of approximately $5 billion. See Part II, “Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” for a description of our share repurchase program. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.” The table below reconciles net cash used for operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. 24 Weeks Ended 6/15/2019 6/16/2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,388 $ 1,087 Capital spending (1,167 ) (945 ) Sales of property, plant and equipment 42 43 Free cash flow $ 263 $ 185 We use free cash flow primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2018 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2018 Form 10-K for further information. 45 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 15, 2019 , the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income and Equity for the twelve and twenty-four week periods ended June 15, 2019 and June 16, 2018 , the related Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the twenty-four week periods ended June 15, 2019 and June 16, 2018 , and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 29, 2018 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 15, 2019, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 29, 2018 , is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York July 9, 2019 46 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our second fiscal quarter of 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During our second fiscal quarter of 2019 , we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity program, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These transitions have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 47 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. The following information should be read in conjunction with the discussion set forth under Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our 2018 Form 10-K and Part II, “Item 1. Legal Proceedings” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 23, 2019. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

See accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 7 Table of Contents Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. Our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 23, 2019 and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 and March 24, 2018 have not been audited. These statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 ( 2018 Form 10-K), as modified to reflect the adoption of those recently issued accounting pronouncements disclosed in Note 2 in this Form 10-Q. This report should be read in conjunction with our 2018 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. While our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of January and February are reflected in our first quarter results. Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The following information is unaudited. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Our Divisions We are organized into six reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada; 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada. PBNA was formerly named North America Beverages; this change did not impact the results of PBNA or our other reportable segments; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa; and 6) Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. 8 Table of Contents Net revenue and operating profit of each division are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended Net Revenue (a) 3/23/2019 3/24/2018 FLNA $ 3,815 $ 3,617 QFNA 594 601 PBNA 4,510 4,415 LatAm 1,241 1,224 ESSA 1,693 1,668 AMENA 1,031 1,037 $ 12,884 $ 12,562 (a) Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products to our customers, each comprising approximately 50 % of our consolidated net revenue. Internationally, our LatAm segment is predominantly a food and snack business, ESSA’s beverage business and food and snack business are each approximately 50 % of the segment’s net revenue and AMENA’s beverage business and food and snack business are approximately 35 % and 65 % , respectively, of the segment’s net revenue. Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and ESSA segments, is approximately 40 % of our consolidated net revenue. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. 12 Weeks Ended Operating Profit 3/23/2019 3/24/2018 FLNA $ 1,159 $ 1,050 QFNA 138 155 PBNA 389 388 LatAm 230 189 ESSA 125 118 AMENA 201 187 Total division $ 2,242 $ 2,087 Corporate unallocated expenses ( 234 ) ( 280 ) $ 2,008 $ 1,807 Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance related to the TCJ Act for the optional reclassification of the residual tax effects, arising from the change in corporate tax rate, in accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings. The reclassification is the difference between the amount previously recorded in other comprehensive income at the historical U.S. federal tax rate that remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the time the TCJ Act was effective and the amount that would have been recorded using the newly enacted rate. This guidance became effective during the first quarter of 2019; however, we did not elect to make the optional reclassification. In 2017, the FASB issued guidance to amend and simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance to better portray the economic results of risk management activities in the financial statements. The guidance expands the ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components, reduces complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, as well as eases certain hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. Under this guidance, certain of our derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that did not previously qualify for hedge accounting treatment can now qualify prospectively. We adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2019; the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures. See Note 9 for further information. 9 Table of Contents In 2016, the FASB issued guidance on leases, with amendments issued in 2018. The guidance requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet but does not change the manner in which expenses are recorded in the income statement. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The two permitted transition methods under the guidance are the modified retrospective transition approach, which requires application of the guidance for all comparative periods presented, and the cumulative effect adjustment approach, which requires prospective application at the adoption date. We utilized a comprehensive approach to assess the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and related disclosures, including the increase in the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and the impact on our current lease portfolio from both a lessor and lessee perspective. We completed our comprehensive review of our lease portfolio including significant leases by geography and by asset type that were impacted by the new guidance, and enhanced our controls. In addition, we implemented a new software platform, and corresponding controls, for administering our leases and facilitating compliance with the new guidance. We adopted the guidance prospectively during the first quarter of 2019. As part of our adoption, we elected not to reassess historical lease classification, recognize short-term leases on our balance sheet, nor separate lease and non-lease components for our real estate leases. In addition, we utilized the portfolio approach to group leases with similar characteristics and did not use hindsight to determine lease term. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements, resulted in an increase of 2 % to each of our total assets and total liabilities on our balance sheet, and had an immaterial increase to retained earnings as of the beginning of 2019. See Note 14 for further information. Note 3 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/23/2019 Cost of sales $ 8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income ( 5 ) Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 26 After-tax amount $ 23 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 0.02 10 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended 3/23/2019 Plan to Date FLNA $ — $ 31 QFNA — 5 PBNA 6 46 LatAm — 9 ESSA 6 14 AMENA 11 14 Corporate 8 15 31 134 Other pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense (a) ( 5 ) 30 $ 26 $ 164 (a) Income amount represents adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.

A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan activity for the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 is as follows: Severance and Other Employee Costs Asset Impairments Other Costs Total Liability as of December 29, 2018 $ 105 $ — $ 1 $ 106 2019 restructuring charges (a) ( 3 ) 8 21 26 Cash payments (b) ( 7 ) — ( 3 ) ( 10 ) Non-cash charges and translation 6 ( 8 ) 3 1 Liability as of March 23, 2019 $ 101 $ — $ 22 $ 123 (a) Income amount represents adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts. (b) Excludes cash expenditures of $ 2 million reported in the cash flow statement in pension and retiree medical contributions. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at March 23, 2019 is expected to be paid by the end of 2019 . 2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 13, 2014 (2014 Productivity Plan) that includes the next generation of productivity initiatives that we believe will strengthen our beverage, food and snack businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency. To build on the 2014 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded and extended the program through the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above to further strengthen our beverage, food and snack businesses. We have substantially completed our 2014 Productivity Plan and do not expect to incur material charges in 2019 associated with this program. We expect pre-tax charges and cash expenditures for the program to approximate the total program estimates of $ 1.3 billion and $ 960 million , respectively. For the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019, there were no material charges related to this program and cash payments were $ 42 million . Substantially all of the restructuring accrual of approximately $ 70 million at March 23, 2019 is expected to be paid by the end of 2019 . 11 Table of Contents For further information, refer to Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K.

Note 5 - Income Taxes Tax Cuts and Jobs Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % , effective January 1, 2018. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission previously issued guidance related to the TCJ Act which allowed recording of provisional tax expense using a measurement period, not to exceed one year, when 13 Table of Contents information necessary to complete the accounting for the effects of the TCJ Act was not available. We elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the TCJ Act when it became effective in the fourth quarter of 2017. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result, we recognized a net tax benefit of $ 28 million ( $ 0.02 per share) for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, which included a provisional transition tax expense of $ 1 million (nominal amount per share) recorded in the first quarter of 2018. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act as of December 29, 2018 was deemed to be complete , this amount was based on prevailing regulations and available information as of December 29, 2018, and additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018 . For the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 , we recognized tax benefits totaling $ 29 million ( $ 0.02 per share) in connection with the TCJ Act, including the impact of additional guidance issued by the IRS in the first quarter of 2019. For further information and discussion of the impact of the TCJ Act, refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K.

We regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. During the first quarter of 2019, we made discretionary contributions of $ 150 million to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) in the United States and $ 17 million to our international plans. During the first quarter of 2018, we made discretionary contributions of $ 1.4 billion to Plan A in the United States and $ 17 million to our international plans. Note 8 - Debt Obligations In the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 , we issued the following senior notes: Interest Rate Maturity Date Amount (a) 0.750 % March 2027 € 500 (b) 1.125 % March 2031 € 500 (b) (a) Represents gross proceeds from issuances of long-term debt excluding debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums.

We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases have remaining lease terms of one year to 20 years , some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years , and some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year . We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 20 Table of Contents As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance). Components of lease cost are as follows: 12 Weeks Ended 3/23/2019 Operating lease cost (a) $ 85 Variable lease cost (b) $ 19 Short-term lease cost (c) $ 84 (a) Includes right-of-use asset amortization of $ 74 million .

On December 5, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of SodaStream, a manufacturer and distributor of sparkling water makers, for $ 144.00 per share in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately $ 3.3 billion . The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 3.3 billion (or $ 3.2 billion , net of cash and cash equivalents acquired), including $ 0.2 billion of consideration held by our paying agent in connection with this acquisition and reported as restricted cash as of March 23, 2019. We accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date include goodwill and other intangible assets of $ 3.0 billion and property, plant and equipment of $ 0.2 billion , all of which are recorded in our ESSA segment. During the first quarter of 2019 , we recorded $ 15 million ( $ 0.01 per share) of incremental costs, in the ESSA segment, primarily related to the inventory fair value adjustment. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to revisions, which may result in adjustments to the preliminary values discussed above as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible, but no later than the end of 2019. 22 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FINANCIAL REVIEW Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Also refer to Note 1 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. Our Critical Accounting Policies The critical accounting policies below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2018 Form 10-K. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year for the expected payout. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Income Taxes In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act as of December 29, 2018 was deemed to be complete, this amount was based on prevailing regulations and available information as of December 29, 23 Table of Contents 2018, and additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. For the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 , we recognized tax benefits totaling $29 million ( $0.02 per share) in connection with the TCJ Act, including the impact of additional guidance issued by the IRS in the first quarter of 2019. Our Business Risks This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q) contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: changes in demand for PepsiCo’s products, as a result of changes in consumer preferences or otherwise; changes in laws related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging of PepsiCo’s products; changes in, or failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations; imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo’s products; imposition of labeling or warning requirements on PepsiCo’s products; PepsiCo’s ability to compete effectively; failure to realize anticipated benefits from PepsiCo’s productivity initiatives or operating model; political conditions, civil unrest or other developments and risks in the markets where PepsiCo’s products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCo’s ability to grow its business in developing and emerging markets; uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; the ability to protect information systems against, or effectively respond to, a cybersecurity incident or other disruption; increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies; business disruptions; product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality, safety and integrity; damage to PepsiCo’s reputation or brand image; failure to successfully complete, integrate or manage acquisitions and joint ventures into PepsiCo’s existing operations or to complete or manage divestitures or refranchisings; changes in estimates and underlying assumptions regarding future performance that could result in an impairment charge; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities; PepsiCo’s ability to recruit, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce; loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any key customer; disruption to the retail landscape, including rapid growth in hard discounters and the e-commerce channel; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCo’s credit ratings; PepsiCo’s ability to implement shared services or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively; fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; climate change or water scarcity, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change or water scarcity; failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or strikes or work stoppages; infringement of intellectual property rights; potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other factors that may adversely affect the price of PepsiCo’s publicly traded securities and financial performance including those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2018 Form 10-K and in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business 24 Table of Contents Risks” of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 , substantially all of our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January and February . In the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 , our operations outside of the United States generated 35% of our consolidated net revenue, with Mexico, Canada, Russia, China and the United Kingdom comprising approximately 17% of our consolidated net revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 , unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 3 percentage points due to declines in the Russian ruble, Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Turkish lira, euro and Canadian dollar. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey, and currency fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to result in challenging operating environments. We also continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the European Union, including how the United Kingdom will interact with other European Union countries following its departure, as well as the economic, operating and political environment in Russia and the potential impact for the ESSA segment and our other businesses. Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging and encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates. We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used varies by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. Additionally, our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce capabilities, distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. 25 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act as of December 29, 2018 was deemed to be complete, this amount was based on prevailing regulations and available information as of December 29, 2018, and additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. For further information on the impact of the TCJ Act, see Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of March 23, 2019 and December 29, 2018 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of these items. Cautionary statements included above, in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” in our 2018 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and future results. Results of Operations – Consolidated Review Consolidated Results Volume Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i.e., kilos, gallons, pounds and case sales), a common servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume. Our divisions’ physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products. For the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 , total servings increased 4%. We discuss volume for our beverage businesses on a bottler case sales (BCS) basis in which all beverage volume is converted to an 8-ounce-case metric. Most of our beverage volume is sold by our Company-owned and franchise-owned bottlers, and that portion is based on our bottlers’ sales to retailers and independent distributors. The remainder of our volume is based on our direct shipments to retailers and independent distributors. We report substantially all of our international beverage volume on a monthly calendar basis. The 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 include beverage volume outside of North America for the months of January and February . Concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) represent our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers, retailers and independent distributors, and is the measure upon which our revenue is based. Net Revenue and Operating Profit 12 Weeks Ended 3/23/2019 3/24/2018 Change Net revenue $ 12,884 $ 12,562 3 % Operating profit $ 2,008 $ 1,807 11 % Operating profit margin 15.6 % 14.4 % 1.2 See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. 26 Table of Contents Operating profit grew 11% and operating profit margin increased 1.2 percentage points. Operating profit growth was driven by net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, an 8-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. A prior-year bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act contributed 5 percentage points to operating profit growth. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth and increased operating profit margin by 0.4 percentage points, primarily due to favorable mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives included in corporate unallocated expenses. Other Consolidated Results 12 Weeks Ended 3/23/2019 3/24/2018 Change Other pension and retiree medical benefits income $ 64 $ 75 $ (11 ) Net interest expense $ (204 ) $ (225 ) $ 21 Tax rate (a) 23.9 % 18.3 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo $ 1,413 $ 1,343 5 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted $ 1.00 $ 0.94 6 % Mark-to-market net impact (0.03 ) 0.02 Restructuring and impairment charges 0.02 0.01 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges 0.01 — Tax (benefits)/net tax expense related to the TCJ Act (a) (0.02 ) — Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, excluding above items (b) $ 0.97 (c) $ 0.96 (c) 1 % Impact of foreign exchange translation 2 Growth in net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, excluding above items, on a constant currency basis (b) 3 % (a) See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. (b) See “Non-GAAP Measures.” (c) Does not sum due to rounding. Other pension and retiree medical benefits income decreased $11 million, primarily reflecting lower expected return on plan assets due to a lower plan asset balance following the recognition of 2018 losses and higher interest costs in the U.S. pension plans. Net interest expense decreased $21 million , reflecting gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability, as well as lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances. These impacts were partially offset by lower interest income due to lower average cash balances. The reported tax rate increased 5.5 percentage points, reflecting an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions, as well as the timing of the impact of certain provisions of the TCJ Act, such as the global intangible low-taxed income provision. These impacts were partially offset by the tax benefits related to the TCJ Act, which reduced the reported tax rate by 2 percentage points. Net income attributable to PepsiCo increased 5% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share increased 6% . Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) contributed 6 percentage points to both net income attributable to PepsiCo growth and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share growth. 27 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring programs; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; amounts associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; pension and retiree medical related items; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures are contained in this Form 10-Q: • cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income and provision for income taxes, each adjusted for items affecting comparability; • operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates; • organic revenue growth; and • free cash flow. Cost of Sales, Gross Profit, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, Other Pension and Retiree Medical Benefits Income and Provision for Income Taxes, Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability; Operating Profit, Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability, and Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share – Diluted, Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability, and the Corresponding Constant Currency Growth Rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans, inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges associated with our acquisition of SodaStream, and tax benefits/net tax expense in connection with the TCJ Act (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, 28 Table of Contents which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance. Organic Revenue Growth We define organic revenue growth as net revenue growth adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. We believe organic revenue provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review.” Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as net cash used for operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-Q are impacted by the following items in each of the following periods: 12 Weeks Ended 3/23/2019 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 5,688 $ 7,196 $ 5,188 $ 2,008 $ 64 $ 446 $ 1,413 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 19 (19 ) 41 (60 ) — (14 ) (46 ) Restructuring and impairment charges (8 ) 8 (23 ) 31 (5 ) 3 23 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges (14 ) 14 (1 ) 15 — 2 13 Tax benefits related to the TCJ Act — — — — — 29 (29 ) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 5,685 $ 7,199 $ 5,205 $ 1,994 $ 59 $ 466 $ 1,374 29 Table of Contents 12 Weeks Ended 3/24/2018 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 5,655 $ 6,907 $ 5,100 $ 1,807 $ 75 $ 304 $ 1,343 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (27 ) 27 (4 ) 31 — 7 24 Restructuring and impairment charges — — (8 ) 8 4 1 11 Provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — — (1 ) 1 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 5,628 $ 6,934 $ 5,088 $ 1,846 $ 79 $ 311 $ 1,379 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax benefit/charge on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural products and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan In connection with our 2019 Productivity Plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, of which we have incurred $164 million through the first quarter of 2019. We expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $800 million for the remainder of 2019, with the balance to be reflected in our fiscal 2020 through 2023 results. These total pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 70% of severance and other employee-related costs, 15% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 15% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. We expect to incur cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion, of which we have incurred $12 million through the first quarter of 2019. We expect cash expenditures of approximately $450 million for the remainder of 2019, with the balance to be reflected in our fiscal 2020 through 2023 cash flows. We expect to incur the majority of the pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our fiscal 2019 and 2020 results. The total expected program pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm ESSA AMENA Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 10 % 3 % 35 % 12 % 25 % 13 % 2 % 2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We have substantially completed our 2014 Productivity Plan and do not expect to incur material charges in 2019 associated with this program. We expect pre-tax charges and cash expenditures for the program to approximate the total program estimates of $1.3 billion and $960 million, respectively. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K for further information related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans. 30 Table of Contents We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Inventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges In the first quarter of 2019 , we recorded $15 million ($0.01 per share) of incremental costs, in the ESSA segment, primarily related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in SodaStream’s balance sheet at acquisition date. See Note 15 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Tax Benefits/Net Tax Expense Related to the TCJ Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. In connection with the TCJ Act, we recorded tax benefits totaling $29 million ( $0.02 per share) in the first quarter of 2019 and a provisional transition tax expense of $1 million (nominal amount per share) in the first quarter of 2018. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations – Division Review The results and discussions below are based on how our Chief Executive Officer monitors the performance of our divisions. See “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding non-GAAP measures. In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries, and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. “Acquisitions and divestitures,” except as otherwise noted, reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

In certain instances, volume growth varies from the amounts disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE, as well as the mix of beverage volume sold by our Company-owned and franchise-owned bottlers. Our net revenue excludes nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, is based on CSE. Operating Profit, Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis Operating profit adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit growth adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures. For further information on these measures see “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability.” Operating Profit and Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability 12 Weeks Ended 3/23/2019 Items Affecting Comparability (a) Reported, GAAP Measure Mark-to-market net impact Restructuring and impairment charges Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges Core, Non-GAAP Measure FLNA $ 1,159 $ — $ — $ — $ 1,159 QFNA 138 — — — 138 PBNA 389 — 6 — 395 LatAm 230 — — — 230 ESSA 125 — 6 15 146 AMENA 201 — 11 — 212 Corporate unallocated expenses (234 ) (60 ) 8 — (286 ) Total $ 2,008 $ (60 ) $ 31 $ 15 $ 1,994 12 Weeks Ended 3/24/2018 Items Affecting Comparability (a) Reported, GAAP Measure Mark-to-market net impact Restructuring and impairment charges Core, Non-GAAP Measure FLNA $ 1,050 $ — $ — $ 1,050 QFNA 155 — — 155 PBNA 388 — 2 390 LatAm 189 — 9 198 ESSA 118 — 4 122 AMENA 187 — 2 189 Corporate unallocated expenses (280 ) 31 (9 ) (258 ) Total $ 1,807 $ 31 $ 8 $ 1,846 (a) See “Items Affecting Comparability.” 32 Table of Contents Operating Profit Growth and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis 12 Weeks Ended 3/23/2019 Impact of Items Affecting Comparability (a) Impact of Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Mark-to-market net impact Restructuring and impairment charges Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges Core % Change, Non-GAAP Measure (b) Foreign exchange translation Core Constant Currency % Change, Non-GAAP Measure (b) FLNA 10 % — — — 10 % — 11 % QFNA (11 )% — — — (11 )% — (11 )% PBNA — % — 1 — 1 % — 1 % LatAm 21 % — (5 ) — 16 % 5 21 % ESSA 6 % — 1 12 19 % 14 33 % AMENA 8 % — 4.5 — 12 % 4.5 17 % Corporate unallocated expenses (16 )% 34 (6 ) — 11 % — 11 % Total 11 % (5 ) 1 1 8 % 2 10 % (a) See “Items Affecting Comparability.” (b) Amounts may not sum due to rounding. FLNA Net revenue grew 5.5% and volume grew 2%. The net revenue growth was primarily driven by effective net pricing and the volume growth. The volume growth reflects mid-single-digit growth in trademark Doritos and Ruffles, and in variety packs, partially offset by a double-digit decline in trademark Santitas. Operating profit increased 10%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases. Additionally, a prior-year bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit growth. QFNA Net revenue and volume each declined 1%. The net revenue decline reflects the volume decline and unfavorable mix, partially offset by favorable net pricing and a 1-percentage-point impact of an acquisition. The volume decline was driven by a double-digit decline in ready-to-eat cereals, partially offset by mid-single digit growth in Aunt Jemima syrup and mix. Operating profit decreased 11%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, a 6-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and the net revenue performance, partially offset by productivity savings. PBNA Net revenue increased 2%, driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decline in volume. Volume decreased 2%, driven by a 4% decline in carbonated soft drink volume, partially offset by a 1% increase in non-carbonated beverage volume. The non-carbonated beverage volume increase primarily reflected a high-single-digit increase in our overall water portfolio, partially offset by a high-single-digit decline in our juice and juice drinks portfolio. Operating profit increased slightly, reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings. These impacts were offset by certain operating cost increases, a 16-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. A prior-year bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act contributed 11 percentage points to operating profit growth and was partially 33 Table of Contents offset by a prior-year gain associated with a sale of an asset which reduced operating profit growth by 4.5 percentage points. LatAm Net revenue increased 1%, reflecting effective net pricing, partially offset by an 8-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Snacks volume declined slightly, reflecting a double-digit decline in Brazil, partially offset by low-single-digit growth in Mexico. Beverage volume grew 7%, reflecting double-digit growth in Brazil, Colombia and Guatemala, partially offset by a double-digit decline in Argentina. Additionally, Mexico and Chile each experienced mid-single-digit growth. Operating profit increased 21%, reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings, and a 12-percentage-point impact of an insurance settlement recovery related to the 2017 earthquake in Mexico. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 15-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, largely due to transaction-related foreign exchange, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. ESSA Net revenue increased 1.5%, reflecting a 7-percentage-point impact of the SodaStream acquisition, as well as effective net pricing, partially offset by a 12-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Snacks volume increased slightly, reflecting mid-single-digit growth in the Netherlands and Poland and low-single-digit growth in Russia, partially offset by a double-digit decline in Turkey, a mid-single-digit decline in South Africa and a low-single-digit decline in the United Kingdom. Beverage volume grew 28%, primarily reflecting a 23-percentage-point impact of the SodaStream acquisition and double-digit growth in Nigeria, partially offset by low-single-digit declines in the United Kingdom and Turkey. Additionally, France grew slightly, Germany experienced low-single-digit growth and Russia and Poland each experienced mid-single-digit growth. Operating profit increased 6%, reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 15-percentage-point impact of an insurance settlement recovery in Russia. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 29-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, largely due to transaction-related foreign exchange, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The SodaStream acquisition contributed 13 percentage points to operating profit growth, partially offset by inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges which reduced operating profit growth by 12 percentage points. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation reduced operating profit growth by 14 percentage points. AMENA Net revenue decreased 1%, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange and the refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in Thailand in 2018, which negatively impacted net revenue performance by 5 percentage points each, mostly offset by volume growth and effective net pricing. Snacks volume grew 4%, reflecting double-digit growth in China and Pakistan and high-single-digit growth in Australia, partially offset by a slight decline in the Middle East. Additionally, India experienced low-single-digit growth. Beverage volume grew 2%, reflecting high-single-digit growth in China and double-digit growth in the Philippines and Vietnam, partially offset by double-digit declines in India and Pakistan and a mid-single-digit decline in the Middle East. 34 Table of Contents Operating profit grew 8%, primarily reflecting the volume growth, productivity savings and the effective net pricing, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 4-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced operating profit growth by 4.5 percentage points. 35 Table of Contents Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated share repurchases, dividend payments, debt repayments and transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt and cash and cash equivalents. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2018 Form 10-K. As of March 23, 2019 , we had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the United States of $2.8 billion, including restricted cash held outside the United States of approximately $0.2 billion related to our acquisition of SodaStream. See Note 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of restricted cash. As of March 23, 2019 , cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of March 23, 2019, our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.8 billion. Under the provisions of the TCJ Act, this transition tax liability must be paid over eight years. Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act. Operating Activities During the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 , net cash used for operating activities was $0.3 billion , compared to net cash used for operating activities of $1.3 billion in the prior-year period. The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects the discretionary contributions of $1.5 billion to our pension and retiree medical plans in the prior year, partially offset by unfavorable working capital comparisons to 2018. Investing Activities During the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 , net cash used for investing activities was $2.3 billion , primarily reflecting $1.8 billion of cash paid in connection with our acquisition of SodaStream, as well as net capital spending of $0.4 billion. We expect 2019 net capital spending to be approximately $4.5 billion . Financing Activities During the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2019 , net cash used for financing activities was $2.9 billion , primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $2.3 billion and payments of long-term debt borrowings of $1.9 billion , partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $1.1 billion. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 13, 2018, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and will expire on June 30, 2021. In addition, on February 15, 2019, we announced a 3% increase in our annualized dividend to $3.82 per share from $3.71 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 36 Table of Contents 2019. We expect to return a total of approximately $8 billion to shareholders in 2019 through share repurchases of approximately $3 billion and dividends of approximately $5 billion. See Part II, “Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” for a description of our share repurchase program. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.” The table below reconciles net cash used for operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. 12 Weeks Ended 3/23/2019 3/24/2018 Net cash used for operating activities $ (345 ) $ (1,309 ) Capital spending (442 ) (352 ) Sales of property, plant and equipment 2 9 Free cash flow $ (785 ) $ (1,652 ) We use free cash flow primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. See “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks,” included in our 2018 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Our Business Risks” included in this Form 10-Q, as well as “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” included in our 2018 Form 10-K. 37 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Results of Review of Interim Financial Information We have reviewed the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of March 23, 2019 , the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the 12 week periods ended March 23, 2019 and March 24, 2018 , and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 29, 2018 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 15, 2019, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 29, 2018 , is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York April 17, 2019 38 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. See “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our first fiscal quarter of 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During our first fiscal quarter of 2019 , we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity program, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These transitions have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 39 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. The following information should be read in conjunction with the discussion set forth under Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our 2018 Form 10-K. As previously disclosed, in April 2017, Corporación Autónoma Regional de Cundinamarca, a Colombian environmental authority (the environmental authority), initiated an administrative proceeding regarding our subsidiary, PepsiCo Alimentos Z.F., Ltda. (PAZ), for allegedly delivering wastewater to a third party without first verifying that the third party had appropriate permits with respect to the discharge of such wastewater. In July 2018, the environmental authority initiated an administrative proceeding to impose a monetary sanction against PAZ with respect to the alleged permitting violation by the third party, and on August 13, 2018, PAZ submitted evidence of its defense to these allegations. During the first quarter of 2019, the environmental authority rejected our appeals, and we paid a penalty of $11,000 to fully resolve this matter. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Sanctions imposed by foreign authorities are levied in local currency and disclosed using the U.S. dollar equivalent at the time of imposition and are subject to currency fluctuations. See also “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2018 Form 10-K. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.
