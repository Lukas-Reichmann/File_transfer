The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023. References to 2022 and 2021 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021. General We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts. We buy most of our merchandise directly from suppliers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from suppliers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. Our e-commerce operations ship 3 Table of Contents merchandise through our depots and logistics operations, as well as through drop-ship and other delivery arrangements with our suppliers. Our average warehouse space is approximately 147,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations. Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2% reward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary stored-value card (shop card). Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 9,000 to 11,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only. In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items. We offer merchandise and services in the following categories: Core Merchandise Categories (or core business): • Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and tobacco) • Non-Foods (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, garden and patio, sporting goods, tires, toys and seasonal, office supplies, automotive care, postage, tickets, apparel, small appliances, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry) • Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery) Warehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and Other Businesses (includes e-commerce 1 , business centers 1 , travel, and other) Warehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we have no gasoline business in Korea, China, or Sweden. We operated 692 gas stations at the end of 2023. Our gasoline business represented approximately 13% of total net sales in 2023. Our other businesses sell products and services that complement our warehouse operations (core and warehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services. Net sales for e-commerce represented approximately 6% of total net sales in 2023. This figure does not include other services we offer online in certain countries such as business delivery, travel, same-day grocery, and various other services. Our business centers carry items 1 E-commerce and business centers are allocated to the appropriate merchandise categories in the Net Sales portion of Item 7. 4 Table of Contents tailored specifically for food services, convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries. Business centers are included in our total warehouse count. Costco Travel offers vacation packages, car rentals, cruises, hotels, and other travel products exclusively for Costco members (offered in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.). We have direct buying relationships with many producers of brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. When sources of supply become unavailable, we seek alternatives. We also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our members is significant. Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Membership Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and websites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document. Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships include a free household card. Our member renewal rate was 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.4% worldwide at the end of 2023. The majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands): 2023 2022 2021 Gold Star 58,800 54,000 50,200 Business, including affiliates 12,200 11,800 11,500 Total paid members 71,000 65,800 61,700 Household cards 56,900 53,100 49,900 Total cardholders 127,900 118,900 111,600 Paid cardholders (except affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses. This program offers services that vary by state and country and provide access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing. Executive members totaled 32.3 million and represented 45.4% of paid members. The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 72.8% of worldwide net sales in 2023. Human Capital Our Code of Ethics requires that we “Take Care of Our Employees,” which is fundamental to the obligation to “Take Care of Our Members.” We must also carefully control our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, so that we can sell high quality goods and services at low prices. Compensation and benefits for employees is our largest expense after the cost of merchandise and is carefully monitored. 5 Table of Contents Employee Base At the end of 2023, we employed 316,000 employees worldwide. Approximately 95% are employed in our membership warehouses and distribution channels, and approximately 5% are represented by unions. We also utilize seasonal employees. The total number of employees by segment was: 2023 2022 2021 United States 208,000 202,000 192,000 Canada 51,000 50,000 47,000 Other International 57,000 52,000 49,000 Total employees 316,000 304,000 288,000 Growth and Engagement We believe that our warehouses are among the most productive in the retail industry, owing largely to the commitment and efficiency of our employees. We seek to provide them not merely with employment but careers. Many attributes of our business contribute to the objective. The more significant include: competitive compensation and benefits for those working in our membership warehouses and distributions channels; a commitment to promoting from within; and a target ratio of at least 50% of our employee base being full-time employees. These attributes contribute to what we consider, especially for the industry, a high retention rate. In 2023, in the U.S. that rate was approximately 90% for employees who have been with us for at least one year. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion The commitment to “Take Care of Our Employees” is also the foundation of our approach to promoting diversity, equity and inclusion and creating an inclusive and respectful workplace. We strive for an environment where all employees feel that they belong, are accepted, included, respected and supported because of who they are. We demonstrate leadership commitment to equity through consistent communication, employee development and education, support of diversity and inclusion initiatives within the organization, community involvement, and supplier diversity. Costco continues its efforts to develop future leaders, including through the supervisor in training programs. In 2023, over 7,800 hourly employees completed the 6-week course. Well Being Costco strives to provide our employees with competitive wages and excellent benefits. In March 2023, we increased the top of the wage scales by 85 cents per hour in the U.S, Canada and Puerto Rico. In September of 2023, we increased the starting wage to at least $18.50 for all entry-level positions in the U.S. We have also expanded our benefits in the U.S. to include additional mental health support for children and adults at little to no cost to our employees. Costco is firmly committed to protecting the health and safety of our members and employees and to serving our communities. For more detailed information regarding our programs and initiatives, see “Employees” within our Sustainability Commitment (located on our website). The Sustainability Commitment and other information on our website are not incorporated by reference into and do not form any part of this Annual Report. Competition Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution strategy, and customer service. We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, online 6 Table of Contents retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors in the U.S. We also compete with other warehouse clubs, including Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club in the U.S. Many of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple competing clubs. Intellectual Property We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered at prices that are generally lower than national brands, and help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private-label items. We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.

We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management ' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. 8 Table of Contents Business and Operating Risks We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations. Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 87% and 84% of net sales and operating income in 2023. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 27% of U.S. net sales in 2023. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among other things: slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products. We may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets, and integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability. We seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance, member traffic, and profitability. We intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. We cannot ensure that new warehouses and new e-commerce websites will be profitable and future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected. We have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of our supply chains and delivery channels. The effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than opening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return. Our failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations. 9 Table of Contents Membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of Executive membership, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations. We sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected. Disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction. We depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. We also rely upon processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics or other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. Our e-commerce operations depend heavily on third-party and in-house logistics providers and is negatively affected when these providers are unable to provide services in a timely fashion. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to environmental, social and governance practices) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns, or we may experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both of which would reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income. Availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital to our business. Failure to successfully execute IT projects and have IT systems available to our business would adversely impact our operations. IT systems play a crucial role in conducting our business. These systems are utilized to process a very high volume of transactions, conduct payment transactions, track and value our inventory and produce reports critical for making business decisions. Failure or disruption of these systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buy products and services from our suppliers, produce goods in our manufacturing plants, move the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to our members. We are undertaking large technology and IT transformation projects. The failure of these projects could adversely impact our business plans and potentially impair our day to day business operations. Given the high volume of transactions we process, it is important that we build strong digital resiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, viruses, internal or external security breaches, errors by employees, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes. Any debilitating failure of our critical IT systems, 10 Table of Contents data centers and backup systems would require significant investments in resources to restore IT services and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of business services, increased cost of moving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members. We are currently making substantial investments in maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or delay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business. Failure to deliver IT transformation efforts efficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Insufficient IT capacity could also impact our capacity for timely, complete and accurate financial and non-financial reporting required by law. We are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst multiplying threat landscapes and in compliance with privacy and data protection regulations globally. Failure to do so could damage our business, including our reputation with members, suppliers and employees, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation and regulatory action. Increased security threats and more sophisticated cyber misconduct pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. We rely upon IT systems and networks, some of which are managed by or belong to third parties, including suppliers, partners, vendors, and service providers. Additionally, we collect, store and process sensitive information relating to our business, members, employees, and other third parties. Operating these IT systems and networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Increased remote work has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks and data, both ours and third parties with whom we work, are increasing in frequency and sophistication, and in some cases, these attempts are successful. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crimes and advanced persistent threats. Phishing attacks have emerged as particularly prominent, including as vectors for ransomware attacks, which have increased in breadth and frequency. While we train our employees as part of our security efforts, that training cannot be completely effective. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. Our IT systems and networks, or those managed by third parties such as cloud providers or suppliers that otherwise host or have access to confidential information, periodically have vulnerabilities, which may go unnoticed for a period of time. Our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities of third parties, are also not always complete or sufficiently detailed, affecting our ability to fully investigate and understand the scope of security events. While our cybersecurity and compliance efforts seek to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we and our third-party service providers have implemented and are implementing, will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property. The potential impacts of a cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation, government enforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems and operations, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in IT systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. This could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition and, critically in light of our business model, loss of member confidence. Further, the insurance coverage we maintain and indemnification arrangements with third parties may be inadequate to cover claims, costs, and liabilities relating to cybersecurity incidents. In addition, data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and other privacy and cybersecurity laws across the various states and around the globe, which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance. We are subject to payment-related risks. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including select credit and debit cards, cash and checks, co-brand cardholder rebates, Executive member 2% reward certificates, and our shop card. As we offer 11 Table of Contents new payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could disrupt our business if these parties become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to fee increases by these service providers. We must comply with evolving payment card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Our failure to offer payment methods desired by our members could create a competitive disadvantage. We might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputation, and expose us to litigation. If our merchandise, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children ' s products, pet products and durable goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety or labeling standards or our members ' expectations, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of illness or injury to our members. Such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or faulty design. Our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause illness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image, and these effects could be long-term. If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media. We are making investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Inability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends on the continued contributions of our employees, including members of our senior management and other key operations, IT, merchandising and administrative personnel. Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for senior management could negatively impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to 12 Table of Contents numerous internal and external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, union relations and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance. Claims for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations. Market and Other External Risks We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, online retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete vigorously and in a variety of ways, including pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results. General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Higher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreign-currency exchange rates, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal, monetary and tax policies including changes in interest rates, tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, pandemics and other health crises, and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory. Additionally, trade-related actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results. 13 Table of Contents Prices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by events like the outbreak of hostilities, including but not limited to the Ukraine conflict, or acts of terrorism. Inflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand. Suppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins. We depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions causing a loss of sales and profits. We buy from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new suppliers, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high-quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available. Our efforts to secure supply could lead to commitments that prove to be unsuccessful in the short and long-term. Our suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies, supply constraints and general economic and political conditions and other risks similar to those we face that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, packaging, legal, regulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. During 2023, our international operations, including Canada, generated 27% and 34% of our net sales and operating income. Our international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. Future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our Canadian and Other International operations and have a corresponding adverse period-over-period effect on our results of operations. As we continue to expand internationally, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase. A portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold. Currency fluctuations may increase our merchandise costs and may not be passed on to members and thus may adversely affect our results of operations. 14 Table of Contents Natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, including those impacted by climate change, such as hurricanes, typhoons, floods, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; and energy shortages; particularly in California or Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our properties, limitations on store operating hours, less frequent visits by members to physical locations, the temporary closure of warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, disruptions to our IT systems, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Pandemics and other health crises, including COVID-19, could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in many respects. The emergence, severity, magnitude and duration of global or regional health crises are uncertain and difficult to predict. A pandemic, such as COVID-19, could affect certain business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things. Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: • The severity and duration of pandemics; • Evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; • Changes in labor markets affecting us and our suppliers; • Unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response; • The pace of post-pandemic recovery; • The long-term impact of the pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors; and • Disruption and volatility within the financial and credit markets. Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business. We use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. Government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental restrictions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. As the economy transitions to lower carbon intensity we cannot guarantee that we will make adequate investments or successfully implement strategies that will effectively achieve our climate-related goals, which could lead to negative perceptions among members and other stakeholders and result in reputational harm. Climate change, extreme weather conditions, wildfires, droughts and rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and increased regulations. More stringent fuel economy standards, changing public policies aimed at increasing the adoption of zero-emission and alternative fuel vehicles and other regulations related to climate change, and evolving consumer preferences will affect our future operations and will adversely impact certain elements of our profitability and require significant capital expenditures. 15 Table of Contents Failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. We believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new member sign-ups, gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the price of our stock to decline. Legal and Regulatory Risks We are subject to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. At the end of 2023, we operated 270 warehouses outside of the U.S. (31% of all warehouse locations), and we plan to continue expanding our international operations. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which are beyond our control. These factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, policy changes, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions), monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. New reporting obligations globally are increasing the cost and complexity of doing business. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. Accounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and otherwise. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price. Uncertainties around our developing systems concerning controls for non-financial reporting also create risks. Changes in tax rates, new U.S. or foreign tax legislation, and exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at any point in time, we may be under examination for value 16 Table of Contents added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may recognize additional tax expense, be subject to additional tax liabilities, or incur losses and penalties, due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in or failure to comply with regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters (such as recycling and extended producer responsibility requirements) could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to a wide and increasingly broad array of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with these laws could result in harm to our members, employees or others, significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Operations at our facilities require the treatment and disposal of wastewater, stormwater and agricultural and food processing wastes, the use and maintenance of refrigeration systems, including ammonia-based chillers, noise, odor and dust management, the operation of mechanized processing equipment, and other operations that potentially could affect the environment and public health and safety. Failure to comply with current and future environmental, health and safety standards could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, illness or injury of our employees, and claims or lawsuits related to such illnesses or injuries, and temporary closures or limits on the operations of facilities. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards, fines, penalties, and remediation costs. We are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed property laws, and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these proceedings, audits, unclaimed property laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management ' s attention and resources. Item 1B—Unresolved Staff Comments None.

MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally discusses the results of operations for 2023 compared to 2022. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2022 compared to 2021 refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 5, 2022. Overview We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). Comparable sales is defined as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. The measure is intended as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations); inflation or deflation and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in 2023 continued to be impacted by inflation, however at a lower rate than what we experienced in 2022. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, as well as passing cost increases on to our members. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). 20 Table of Contents We believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage and lower SG&A expense, relative to our non-gasoline businesses. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Government actions in various countries relating to tariffs, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business, domestically and internationally, generally has a lower gross margin percentage than our warehouse operations. The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid-membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's currency exchange rates. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's average price per gallon sold. Results expressed excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and gasoline prices should be reviewed in conjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 21 Table of Contents Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023. References to 2022 and 2021 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Highlights for 2023 versus 2022 include: • We opened 26 new warehouses, including three relocations: 13 net new in the U.S. and 10 new in our Other International segment. We opened the same number of new warehouses, including relocations, in 2022; • Net sales increased 7% to $237,710, driven by a 3% increase in comparable sales, sales at new warehouses opened in 2022 and 2023, and the benefit of one additional week of sales in 2023; • Membership fee revenue increased 8% to $4,580, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive membership, and one additional week of membership fees in 2023; • Gross margin percentage increased nine basis points, driven primarily by a smaller LIFO charge in 2023 compared to 2022 and our core merchandise categories. This was partially offset by charges of $391, predominantly related to the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points, due to increased costs in warehouse operations and other businesses, primarily wage increases effective in March and July 2022, and March 2023, as well as lower sales growth; • The effective tax rate in 2023 was 25.9%, compared to 24.6% in 2022; • Net income increased 8% to $6,292, or $14.16 per diluted share compared to $5,844, or $13.14 per diluted share in 2022; • In January 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000; and • In April 2023, the Board of Directors approved a 13% increase in the quarterly cash dividend. 22 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 2023 2022 2021 Net Sales $ 237,710 $ 222,730 $ 192,052 Changes in net sales: U.S. 7 % 17 % 16 % Canada 4 % 16 % 22 % Other International 9 % 10 % 23 % Total Company 7 % 16 % 18 % Changes in comparable sales: U.S. 3 % 16 % 15 % Canada 2 % 15 % 20 % Other International 3 % 7 % 19 % Total Company 3 % 14 % 16 % E-commerce (6) % 10 % 44 % Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-currency and gasoline prices: U.S. 4 % 10 % 14 % Canada 8 % 12 % 12 % Other International 8 % 10 % 13 % Total Company 5 % 11 % 13 % E-commerce (5) % 10 % 43 % Net Sales Net sales increased $14,980 or 7% during 2023. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 3%, sales at new warehouses opened in 2022 and 2023, and one additional week of sales in 2023. Sales increased $12,761, or 7% in core merchandise categories, led by foods and sundries and fresh foods; while non-foods decreased. Sales increased $2,219, or 5% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by pharmacy, food court, and travel. During 2023, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $3,484, 156 basis points, compared to 2022, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 7%, positively impacting net sales by $2,148, or 96 basis points. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $1,592, or 71 basis points, compared to 2022, with a 6% decrease in the average price per gallon. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 3% during 2023 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency, partially offset by a decrease in average ticket. Membership Fees 2023 2022 2021 Membership fees $ 4,580 $ 4,224 $ 3,877 Membership fees increase 8 % 9 % 9 % 23 Table of Contents Membership fee revenue increased 8% in 2023, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive membership, and the benefit of an additional week. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted membership fees by $76 compared to 2022. At the end of 2023, our member renewal rates were 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.4% worldwide. More members auto renewing and higher penetration of Executive members benefit renewal rates. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Gross Margin 2023 2022 2021 Net sales $ 237,710 $ 222,730 $ 192,052 Less merchandise costs 212,586 199,382 170,684 Gross margin $ 25,124 $ 23,348 $ 21,368 Gross margin percentage 10.57 % 10.48 % 11.13 % Gross margin percentage increased nine basis points compared to 2022. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin was 10.50%, an increase of two basis points. This two basis point increase was positively impacted by: 18 basis points due to a smaller LIFO charge in 2023 compared to 2022, and seven basis points due to core merchandise categories, predominantly foods and sundries. These were offset by: 16 basis points due to the downsizing and then discontinuation of our charter shipping activities; four basis points due to increased 2% rewards; and three basis points due to warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce, partially offset by gasoline and business centers. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $349, compared to 2022, attributable to our Canadian and Other International Operations. The gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased two basis points, driven by foods and sundries and non-foods, partially offset by fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased in our U.S. segment, due to a smaller LIFO charge and increases in core merchandise categories, primarily foods and sundries, partially offset by the charges related to the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities discussed above and warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin percentage increased in our Canada segment, attributable to increases in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Our Other International gross margin percentage decreased, largely due to decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by warehouse ancillary and other businesses. All segments were negatively impacted by increased 2% rewards. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2023 2022 2021 SG&A expenses $ 21,590 $ 19,779 $ 18,537 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 9.08 % 8.88 % 9.65 % 24 Table of Contents SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points compared to 2022. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation was 9.02%, an increase of 14 basis points. The comparison to last year was negatively impacted by 16 basis points in warehouse operations and other businesses, largely driven by wage increases effective in March and July 2022, and March 2023, as well as lower sales growth. Central operating costs were also higher by six basis points. SG&A was positively impacted by eight basis points due to the prior year's write-off of information technology assets and a charge related to granting our employees additional vacation. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased SG&A expenses by approximately $281 compared to 2022, attributable to our Canadian and Other International Operations. Interest Expense 2023 2022 2021 Interest expense $ 160 $ 158 $ 171 Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes and financing leases. For more information on our debt arrangements, refer to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

Foreign-currency transaction gains, net include revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations and mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts. See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Provision for Income Taxes 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 2,195 $ 1,925 $ 1,601 Effective tax rate 25.9 % 24.6 % 24.0 % The effective tax rate for 2023 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $62, primarily due to excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.6%. The effective tax rate for 2022 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $130, primarily due to excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.2%. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 2023 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,068 $ 7,392 $ 8,958 Net cash used in investing activities (4,972) (3,915) (3,535) Net cash used in financing activities (2,614) (4,283) (6,488) 25 Table of Contents Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $15,234 and $11,049 at September 3, 2023, and August 28, 2022. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented $2,282 and $2,010. These receivables generally settle within four days. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted cash and cash equivalents positively by $15 and $46 in 2023 and 2021, and negatively by $249 in 2022. Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. See Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for amounts outstanding on September 3, 2023, related to debt and leases. Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. Construction and land-purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to the development and opening of new and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months. Management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows, with capacity under existing and available credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $11,068 in 2023, compared to $7,392 in 2022. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including inventory levels and turnover, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $4,972 in 2023, compared to $3,915 in 2022, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Expenditures Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In 2023, we spent $4,323 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approxima tely $4,400 to $4,600 du ring fiscal 2024. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 26 new warehous es, including three relocations, in 2023, and plan to open up to 28 additional new warehouses, including one relocation, in 2024. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs and the economic environment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $2,614 in 2023, compared to $4,283 in 2022. Cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to the payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, and withholding taxes on stock-based awards. In 2022, cash flow used in financing activities included 26 Table of Contents payments to our former joint-venture partner for a dividend and the purchase of their equity interest in Taiwan, totaling $1,050 in the aggregate, and repayments of our 2.300% Senior Notes. Stock Repurchase Programs On January 19, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, which expires in January 2027. During 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 1,341,000 and 863,000 shares of common stock, at average prices of $504.68 and $511.46, totaling approximately $677 and $442. These amounts may differ from the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,563 at the end of 2023. Dividends Cash dividends declared in 2023 totaled $3.84 per share, as compared to $3.38 per share in 2022. In April 2023, the Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.90 to $1.02 per share. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At September 3, 2023, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,234. Our international operations maintain $756 of this capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $167 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities, which are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, were immaterial at the end of 2023 and 2022. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $217. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2023 totaled $182, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities Claims for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to seek to limit exposures arising from very large losses. We use various risk management mechanisms, including a 27 Table of Contents wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, and participate in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Recent Accounting Pronouncements We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements. Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions) Our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents, as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short-term investments are in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. Our policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, U.S. government and government agency money market funds, and insured bank balances. Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers’ acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies. A 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2023 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value. For those investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. The nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of 2023, long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $6,484. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt. Foreign Currency Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our 28 Table of Contents international subsidiaries. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to the Company's forward foreign-exchange contracts, see Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at September 3, 2023, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $109 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to some of the fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment. 29 Table of Contents Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Page Reports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 31 Consolidated Statements of Income 34 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income 35 Consolidated Balance Sheets 36 Consolidated Statements of Equity 37 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 38 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 39 30 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Costco Wholesale Corporation: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 3, 2023, and August 28, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 53-week period ended September 3, 2023, and the 52-week periods ended August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 3, 2023, and August 28, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the 53-week period ended September 3, 2023, and the 52-week periods ended August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 3, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated October 10, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 31 Table of Contents Evaluation of workers' compensation self-insurance liabilities As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated self-insurance liabilities as of September 3, 2023, were $1,513 million, a portion of which related to workers’ compensation self-insurance liabilities for the United States operations. We identified the evaluation of the Company’s workers’ compensation self-insurance liabilities for the United States operations as a critical audit matter because of the extent of specialized skill and knowledge needed to evaluate the underlying assumptions and judgments made by the Company in the actuarial models. Specifically, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company's selected loss rates and initial expected losses used in the actuarial models. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s self-insurance workers' compensation process. This included controls related to the development and selection of the assumptions listed above used in the actuarial calculation and review of the actuarial report. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in: • Assessing the actuarial models used by the Company for consistency with generally accepted actuarial standards • Evaluating the Company’s ability to estimate self-insurance workers' compensation liabilities by comparing its historical estimates with actual incurred losses and paid losses • Evaluating the above listed assumptions underlying the Company’s actuarial estimates by developing an independent expectation of the self-insurance workers' compensation liabilities and comparing them to the amounts recorded by the Company. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002. Seattle, Washington October 10, 2023 32 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Costco Wholesale Corporation: Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries ’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September 3, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 3, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 3, 2023, and August 28, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 53-week period ended September 3, 2023, and the 52-week periods ended August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021 , and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated October 10, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Seattle, Washington October 10, 2023 33 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (amounts in

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At September 3, 2023, Costco operated 861 warehouses worldwide: 591 in the United States (U.S.) located in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 107 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 33 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 18 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, five in China, four in Spain, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco and its subsidiaries. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023. References to 2022 and 2021 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Reclassification Reclassifications were made to the 2022 and 2021 consolidated statements of cash flows to conform with current year presentation. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to four days. Credit and debit card receivables were $ 2,282 and $ 2,010 at the end of 2023 and 2022. Short-Term Investments Short-term investments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. Government and Agency Notes), with maturities at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five 39 Table of Contents years may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. These available-for-sale investments have a low level of inherent credit risk given they are issued by the U.S. Government and Agencies. Changes in their fair value are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and market liquidity. Short-term investments classified as held-to-maturity are financial instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis. The Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for credit impairment, using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be impaired as the result of a credit loss, the Company recognizes the loss in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2 , 3 , and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all other non-derivative financial instruments are based on independent external valuation information. The pricing process uses data from a variety of independent external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves including but not limited to treasury benchmarks, Secured Overnight Financing Rate and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable, using the fair value of the individual securities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred. Current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities include the Company's long-term debt, which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs. Discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair 40 Table of Contents value of the Company's long-term debt is based primarily on reported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon interest rates, maturities, and credit. Receivables, Net Receivables consist primarily of vendor, reinsurance, credit card incentive, third-party pharmacy and other receivables. Vendor receivables include discounts and volume rebates. Balances are generally presented on a gross basis, separate from any related payable due. In certain circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor, in which case the receivables are presented on a net basis. Reinsurance receivables are held by the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and primarily represent amounts ceded through reinsurance arrangements gross of the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Credit card incentive receivables primarily represent amounts earned under co-branded credit card arrangements. Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members’ insurers. Other receivables primarily consist of amounts due from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items. The valuation allowance related to receivables was not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of 2023 and 2022. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories consist of the following: 2023 2022 United States $ 12,153 $ 13,160 Canada 1,579 1,966 Other International 2,919 2,781 Merchandise inventories $ 16,651 $ 17,907 Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and inventory levels have been determined. An immaterial LIFO charge was recorded in 2023. Due to inflation in 2022, a $ 438 charge was recorded to merchandise costs to increase the cumulative LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories at August 28, 2022. Canadian and Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly valued using the cost and retail inventory methods, respectively, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts using estimates based on experience. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates, provided that they are probable and reasonably estimable. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization expense is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements made after the beginning of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease plus any renewals that are reasonably certain at the date the leasehold improvements are made. 41 Table of Contents The Company capitalizes certain computer software and costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. During development, these costs are included in construction in progress. To the extent that the assets become ready for their intended use, these costs are included in equipment and fixtures and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or change asset function or useful life are capitalized. Assets removed during the remodel, refurbishment or improvement are retired. Assets classified as held-for-sale at the end of 2023 and 2022 were immaterial. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances at the end of 2023 and 2022: Estimated Useful Lives 2023 2022 Land N/A $ 8,590 $ 7,955 Buildings and improvements 5 - 50 years 22,001 20,120 Equipment and fixtures 3 - 20 years 11,512 10,275 Construction in progress N/A 1,266 1,582 43,369 39,932 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 16,685 ) ( 15,286 ) Property and equipment, net $ 26,684 $ 24,646 The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in circumstances may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For asset groups held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In the event that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal to the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale (disposal group), the carrying value is compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisals from third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. Impairment charges recognized in 2023 were immaterial. In 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized write-offs of $ 118 and $ 84 for information technology assets which are reflected in SG&A. Leases The Company leases land, buildings, and/or equipment at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities. Leases generally contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair market value or purchase price stated in the agreement; or (c) a right of first refusal in the event of a third-party offer. Some leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume, which are recognized as variable lease payments. Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 42 Table of Contents The Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. Non-lease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for together as a single lease component for all asset classes. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. Impairment of ROU assets is evaluated in a similar manner as described in Property and Equipment, Net above. During 2023, the Company recognized charges totaling $391, primarily related to the impairment of certain leased assets associated with charter shipping activities. This charge is included in merchandise costs. The Company's asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that must be removed at the end of a lease. These obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability, with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term, based upon the estimated fair value of the costs to remove the improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same depreciation method as the leasehold improvement assets and are included with buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associated with these leases are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results. Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable segment: United States Canada Other International Total Balance at August 29, 2021 $ 953 $ 28 $ 15 $ 996 Changes in currency translation — ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) Balance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993 Changes in currency translation — ( 1 ) 2 1 Balance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994 Definite-lived intangible assets, which are not material, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit. Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities Claims for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded 43 Table of Contents predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The Company uses various risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive) and participates in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences, claims, or expenses differ from these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of 2023 and 2022, these insurance liabilities were $ 1,513 and $ 1,364 in the aggregate, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature. The captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes third-party participants. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program are designed to limit a participating members’ individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior activity. Derivatives The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts relate primarily to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding contracts upon certain triggering events. The aggregate fair value amounts of derivative instruments in a net liability position and the amount needed to settle the instruments immediately if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered were immaterial at the end of 2023 and 2022. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were $ 1,068 and $ 1,242 at the end of 2023 and 2022. See Note 3 for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2023 and 2022. The unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2023, 2022 and 2021. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodity products used in retail and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment. Foreign Currency The functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are their local currencies. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Revenues and expenses of the Company’s consolidated foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. 44 Table of Contents The Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Generally, these include the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries revalued to their functional currency. Also included are realized foreign-currency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items were $ 46 and $ 84 in 2023 and 2022 and immaterial in 2021. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and member returns. The Company reserves for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods. The Company also provides expanded products and services through warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The majority of revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally is established when Costco is primarily responsible for merchandising decisions, pricing discretion, and maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member service and satisfaction. The Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. Deferred membership fees at the end of 2023 and 2022 were $ 2,337 and $ 2,174 . In most countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum value, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2023, 2022, and 2021, the net reduction in sales was $ 2,576 , $ 2,307 , and $ 2,047 . The Company sells and otherwise provides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for outstanding shop card balances as a shop card liability, net of estimated breakage. Shop card liabilities are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Citibank, N.A. is the exclusive issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members. The Company receives various forms of consideration from Citibank, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco. A portion of the royalty is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receive, after taking into consideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. The Company also maintains co-branded credit card arrangements in Canada and certain other International subsidiaries. 45 Table of Contents Merchandise Costs Merchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company’s depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, and are reduced by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses. Vendor Consideration The Company receives funds from vendors for discounts and a variety of other programs. These programs are evidenced by agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebate or discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers’ compensation costs for warehouse employees (other than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses which are reflected in merchandise costs) as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, stock compensation expense, credit and debit card processing fees, utilities, preopening, as well as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse and e-commerce website operations. Retirement Plans The Company's 401(k) retirement plan is available to all U.S. employees over the age of 18 who have completed 90 days of employment. The plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. The Company also has a defined contribution plan for employees in Canada and contributes a percentage of each employee's wages. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations have defined benefit and defined contribution plans, which are not material. Amounts expensed under all plans were $ 914 , $ 824 , and $ 748 for 2023, 2022, and 2021, and are predominantly included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Stock-Based Compensation The Company grants stock-based compensation, primarily to employees and non-employee directors. Grants to executive officers are generally performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approvals, there have been amended and restated plans and new provisions implemented by the Company. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over five years and three years and are subject to quarterly vesting in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25 years of service with the Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting date. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. Compensation expense for awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for the entire award. The terms of the RSUs, including performance-based awards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained 25 or more and five or more years of service with the Company, respectively. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and undelivered shares. Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long-service term. The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the 46 Table of Contents common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense is predominantly included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Certain stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 7 for additional information on the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases, credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized. The timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and records changes as appropriate. Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco The computation of basic net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method for shares subject to RSUs. Stock Repurchase Programs Repurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and is applied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6 for additional information.

There were no transfers between levels during 2023 or 2022. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. Please see Note 1 for additional information. 48 Table of Contents Note 4—Debt Short-Term Borrowings The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $ 1,234 and $ 1,257 , in 2023 and 2022. Short-term borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2023 and 2022. Long-Term Debt The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100 % of the principal amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101 % of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs. Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In May 2023, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $ 75 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes. At the end of 2023 and 2022, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $ 5,738 and $ 6,033 .

Stock Repurchase Programs The Company's stock repurchase program is conducted under a $ 4,000 authorization by the Board of Directors, which expires in January 2027. As of the end of 2023, the remaining amount available under the authorization was $ 3,563 .

Purchases are made 51 Table of Contents from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares ( 10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate of 27,800,000 shares ( 15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes. Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity At the end of 2023, 8,747,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards were outstanding: • 2,869,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and • 176,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 135,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of performance targets for 2023. This determination occurred in September 2023, at which time at least 33% of the units vested, as a result of the long service of all executive officers, with the exception of one executive officer who has less than 25 years of service. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for accelerated vesting requirements. The following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2023: Number of Units (in 000’s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at the end of 2022 3,449 $ 338.41 Granted 1,814 471.47 Vested and delivered ( 2,102 ) 352.53 Forfeited ( 116 ) 398.31 Outstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63 The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $ 471.47 , $ 476.06 , and $ 369.15 in 2023, 2022, and 2021. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2023 was $ 790 and the weighted-average period of time over which this cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2023 were approximately 1,050,000 RSUs vested but not yet delivered. Summary of Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits: 2023 2022 2021 Stock-based compensation expense $ 774 $ 724 $ 665 Less recognized income tax benefit 163 154 140 Stock-based compensation expense, net $ 611 $ 570 $ 525 52 Table of Contents Note 8— Taxes Income Taxes Income before income taxes is comprised of the following: 2023 2022 2021 Domestic $ 6,264 $ 5,759 $ 4,931 Foreign 2,223 2,081 1,749 Total $ 8,487 $ 7,840 $ 6,680 The provisions for income taxes are as follows: 2023 2022 2021 Federal: Current $ 1,056 $ 798 $ 718 Deferred 33 ( 35 ) 84 Total federal 1,089 763 802 State: Current 374 333 265 Deferred 10 ( 5 ) 11 Total state 384 328 276 Foreign: Current 732 851 557 Deferred ( 10 ) ( 17 ) ( 34 ) Total foreign 722 834 523 Total provision for income taxes $ 2,195 $ 1,925 $ 1,601 The reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2023, 2022, and 2021 is as follows: 2023 2022 2021 Federal taxes at statutory rate $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 % $ 1,403 21.0 % State taxes, net 302 3.6 267 3.4 243 3.6 Foreign taxes, net 160 1.9 231 3.0 92 1.4 Employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) ( 25 ) ( 0.3 ) ( 23 ) ( 0.3 ) ( 91 ) ( 1.3 ) Other ( 24 ) ( 0.3 ) ( 196 ) ( 2.5 ) ( 46 ) ( 0.7 ) Total $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 % $ 1,601 24.0 % The Company recognized total net tax benefits of $ 62 , $ 130 and $ 163 in 2023, 2022 and 2021. These include benefits of $ 54 , $ 94 and $ 75 , related to stock-based compensation. During 2021, there was a net tax benefit of $ 70 related to the portion of the special dividend paid through the Company's 401(k) plan. 53 Table of Contents The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows: 2023 2022 Deferred tax assets: Equity compensation $ 89 $ 84 Deferred income/membership fees 309 302 Foreign tax credit carry forward 250 201 Operating lease liabilities 678 727 Accrued liabilities and reserves 761 694 Other 20 5 Total deferred tax assets 2,107 2,013 Valuation allowance ( 422 ) ( 313 ) Total net deferred tax assets 1,685 1,700 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment ( 867 ) ( 962 ) Merchandise inventories ( 380 ) ( 231 ) Operating lease right-of-use assets ( 655 ) ( 701 ) Foreign branch deferreds ( 87 ) ( 85 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 1,989 ) ( 1,979 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 304 ) $ ( 279 ) The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2023 and 2022 include deferred income tax assets of $ 491 and $ 445 , included in other long-term assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $ 795 and $ 724 , included in other long-term liabilities. In 2023 and 2022, the Company had valuation allowances of $ 422 and $ 313 , primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carry forwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030. The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries after 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested (other than China and Taiwan) and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $ 3,225 , to be indefinitely reinvested and has not provided for withholding or state taxes. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2023 and 2022 is as follows: 2023 2022 Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 33 Gross increases—current year tax positions 1 1 Gross increases—tax positions in prior years 11 12 Gross decreases—tax positions in prior years ( 11 ) ( 12 ) Gross decreases—settlements — ( 12 ) Lapse of statute of limitations ( 1 ) ( 6 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 16 $ 16 54 Table of Contents The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2023 and 2022, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods is $ 14 and $ 15 at the end of 2023 and 2022. Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties recognized during 2023 and 2022, and accrued at the end of each respective period were not material. The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12 months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present. Other Taxes The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. Note 9—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of basic and of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000’s): 2023 2022 2021 Net income attributable to Costco $ 6,292 $ 5,844 $ 5,007 Weighted average basic shares 443,854 443,651 443,089 RSUs 598 1,106 1,257 Weighted average diluted shares 444,452 444,757 444,346 Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in many claims, proceedings and litigations arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be losses in excess of amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. The Company has recorded immaterial accruals with 55 Table of Contents respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but monitors for developments that make the contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in an action commenced in July 2013 under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to employees who work at entrance and exit doors in California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2013-1-CV-248813; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint sought relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees.

Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The state court action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal action. In September 2023 the parties reached an agreement in principle on a settlement for an immaterial amount. In December 2020, a former employee filed suit against the Company asserting collective and class claims on behalf of non-exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York Labor Law for failure to pay for all hours worked, failure to pay certain non-exempt employees on a weekly basis, and failure to provide proper wage statements and notices. The plaintiff also asserted individual retaliation claims. Cappadora v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 1:20-cv-06067; E.D.N.Y.).

The Company has moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual claims and to dismiss the class action complaint. On September 7, 2021, the same plaintiff filed a separate representative action under PAGA, asserting the same Labor Code violations and seeking civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The case has been stayed pending arbitration of the plaintiff's individual claims. In September 2021, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding failure to provide sick pay, failure to timely pay wages due at separation from employment, and for violations of California's unfair competition law. De Benning v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 34-2021-00309030-CU-OE-GDS; Sacramento Superior Court). In April 2022, a settlement for an immaterial amount was agreed upon, subject to court approval.

In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are cases filed against the Company by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and a hospital in Texas, class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged 57 Table of Contents increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 43 states and American Samoa. Claims against the Company filed in federal court outside the MDL have been asserted by certain counties and cities in Florida and Georgia; claims filed by certain cities and counties in New York are pending in state court. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, Utah, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of the pending matters. Members of the Board of Directors, six corporate officers and the Company were defendants in a shareholder derivative action filed in June 2022 related to chicken welfare and alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. Smith, et ano. v. Vachris, et al., Superior Court of the State of Washington, County of King, No, 22-2-08937-7SEA. The complaint sought from the individual defendants' damages, injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys' fees. On March 28, 2023, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the action. The plaintiffs subsequently made a demand that the Board of Directors take various actions, including among other things, pursuing claims against directors and officers of the type asserted in the litigation. A demand review committee of the Board has been appointed to make a recommendation to the Board as to the demand. In February 2023, Go Green Norcal, LLC filed an arbitration demand against the Company. The demand alleged a breach of a supply agreement and sought unspecified damages and cancellation of a loan from the Company. In March 2023, the Company filed its answer, denying any breach by the Company, along with counterclaims against Go Green and an affiliate for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and an accounting. In August 2023 the plaintiff asserted that its damages exceed $ 70 million. In January 2023 the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Attorney's Office, Western District of Washington, requesting documents. The government is conducting a False Claims Act investigation concerning whether the Company presented or caused to be presented to the federal government for payment false claims relating to prescription medications. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 58 Table of Contents Note 11—Segment Reporting The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden.

Item 9A—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 3, 2023, and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 3, 2023, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 3, 2023. The attestation of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is included with the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 60 Table of Contents Item 9B—Other Information (amounts in whole dollars) Disclosure pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

PART I Item 1—Business Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Japan, United Kingdom (U.K.), Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Spain, France, China, and Iceland. Costco operated 838, 815, and 795 warehouses worldwide at August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol “COST.” We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2022, 2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively. General We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts. We buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. For our e-commerce operations we ship merchandise through our depots, our logistics operations for big and bulky items, as well as through drop-ship and other delivery arrangements with our suppliers. 3 Table of Contents Our average warehouse space is approximately 146,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations. Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2% reward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary stored-value card (shop card). Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only. In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items. We offer merchandise and services in the following categories: Core Merchandise Categories (or core business): • Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and tobacco) • Non-Foods (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, garden and patio, sporting goods, tires, toys and seasonal, office supplies, automotive care, postage, tickets, apparel, small appliances, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry) • Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery) Warehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and Other Businesses (includes e-commerce, business centers, travel, and other) Warehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we have no gasoline business in Korea or China. We operated 668 gas stations at the end of 2022. Net sales for our gasoline business increased to approximately 14% of total net sales in 2022. Our other businesses sell products and services that complement our warehouse operations (core and warehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services. Net sales for e-commerce represented approximately 7% of total net sales in 2022. This figure does not include other services we offer online in certain countries such as business delivery, travel, same-day grocery, and various other services. Our business centers carry items tailored specifically for food services, convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries. Business centers are included in our total warehouse count. Costco Travel offers vacation packages, hotels, cruises, and other travel products exclusively for Costco members (offered in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.). 4 Table of Contents We have direct buying relationships with many producers of brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented supply constraints, including disruptions and delays that have impacted and could continue to impact the flow and availability of certain products. When sources of supply become unavailable, we seek alternatives. We also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our members is significant. Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Membership Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and websites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document. Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships include a free household card. Our member renewal rate was 93% in the U.S. and Canada and 90% worldwide at the end of 2022. The majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. At the end of 2020, we standardized our membership count methodology globally to be consistent with the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in the addition to the count of approximately 2.0 million total cardholders for 2020, of which 1.3 million were paid members. Membership fee income and the renewal rate calculations were not affected. Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands): 2022 2021 2020 Gold Star 54,000 50,200 46,800 Business, including affiliates 11,800 11,500 11,300 Total paid members 65,800 61,700 58,100 Household cards 53,100 49,900 47,400 Total cardholders 118,900 111,600 105,500 Paid cardholders (except affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, for which the additional fee varies. Executive members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses. This program also offers (except in Mexico and Korea) access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing. These services are generally provided by third parties and vary by state and country. Executive members totaled 29.1 million and represented 57% of paid members (excluding affiliates) in the U.S. and Canada, and 22% of paid members (excluding affiliates) in our Other International operations. The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 71% of worldwide net sales in 2022. 5 Table of Contents Human Capital Our Code of Ethics requires that we “Take Care of Our Employees,” which is fundamental to the obligation to “Take Care of Our Members.” We must also carefully control our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, so that we can sell high quality goods and services at low prices. Compensation and benefits for employees is our largest expense after the cost of merchandise and is carefully monitored. Employee Base At the end of 2022, we employed 304,000 employees worldwide. The large majority (approximately 95%) is employed in our membership warehouses and distribution channels, and less than 10% are represented by unions. We also utilize seasonal employees during peak periods. The total number of employees by segment is: Number of Employees 2022 2021 2020 United States 202,000 192,000 181,000 Canada 50,000 47,000 46,000 Other International 52,000 49,000 46,000 Total employees 304,000 288,000 273,000 Growth and Engagement We believe that our warehouses are among the most productive in the retail industry, owing in substantial part to the commitment and efficiency of our employees. We seek to provide them not merely with employment but careers. Many attributes of our business contribute to the objective; the more significant include: competitive compensation and benefits for those working in our membership warehouses and distributions channels; a commitment to promoting from within; and maintaining a ratio of at least 50% of our employee base being full-time employees. These attributes contribute to what we consider, especially for the industry, a high retention rate. In 2022, in the U.S. that rate was approximately 90% for employees who have been with us for at least one year. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion The commitment to “Take Care of Our Employees” is also the foundation of our approach to diversity, equity and inclusion and creating an inclusive and respectful workplace. In 2022, we appointed a new Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer. Embracing differences is important to the growth of our Company. It leads to more opportunities, innovation, and employee satisfaction and connects us to the communities where we do business. Well Being In October 2021, we provided an increase of a minimum of $0.50 per hour for U.S. and Canada wage scales. In March 2022, we provided certain compensation increases, including a $0.75 per hour increase to the top of the U.S. wage scales, increased the starting wage to $17.50, and granted our employees one additional day of paid time off. In July 2022, we provided an additional increase to the top of the U.S. wage scales of $0.50 per hour. Costco is firmly committed to helping protect the health and safety of our members and employees and to serving our communities. As the global effect of COVID-19 continues to evolve, we are closely monitoring the changing situation and complying with public health guidance. For more detailed information regarding our programs and initiatives, see “Employees” within our Sustainability Commitment (located on our website). This report and other information on our website are not incorporated by reference into and do not form any part of this Annual Report. 6 Table of Contents Competition Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution strategy, and customer service. We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors in the U.S. We also compete with other warehouse clubs, including Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club. Many of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple competing clubs. Intellectual Property We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered at prices that are generally lower than national brands, and help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private-label items. We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.

We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management ' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Business and Operating Risks We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations. Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 87% and 85% of net sales and operating income in 2022, respectively. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 28% of U.S. net sales in 2022. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among other things: slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products. We may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets, and integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability. We seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance, member traffic, and profitability. We intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. We cannot ensure that new warehouses and new e-commerce websites will be profitable and future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected. 9 Table of Contents We have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of our supply chains and delivery channels. The effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than opening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return. Our failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations. Membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of Executive membership, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations. We sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected. Disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction. We depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. We also rely upon processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics or other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. Our e-commerce operations depend heavily on third-party and in-house logistics providers and is negatively affected when these providers are unable to provide services in a timely fashion. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to environmental, social and governance practices) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns, or we may experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both of which would reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income. Availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital to our business. Failure to successfully execute IT projects and have IT systems available to our business would adversely impact our operations. IT systems play a crucial role in conducting our business. These systems are utilized to process a very high volume of transactions, conduct payment transactions, track and value our inventory and produce reports critical for making business decisions. Failure or disruption of these systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buy products and services from our suppliers, produce goods in our manufacturing plants, move the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to our members. We are undertaking large technology and IT transformation projects. The failure of these 10 Table of Contents projects could adversely impact our business plans and potentially impair our day to day business operations. Given the high volume of transactions we process, it is important that we build strong digital resiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, viruses, internal or external security breaches, errors by employees, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes. Any debilitating failure of our critical IT systems, data centers and backup systems would require significant investments in resources to restore IT services and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of business services, increased cost of moving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members. We are currently making substantial investments in maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or delay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business. Failure to deliver IT transformation efforts efficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst multiplying threat landscapes and in compliance with privacy and data protection regulations globally. Failure to do so could damage our business, including our reputation with members, suppliers and employees, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation and regulatory action. Increased security threats and more sophisticated cyber misconduct pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. We rely upon IT systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with virtually all of our business activities. Additionally, we collect, store and process sensitive information relating to our business, members, suppliers and employees. Operating these IT systems and networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Increased remote work has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Threats designed to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks and data, both ours and third parties with whom we work, are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crimes and advanced persistent threats. Phishing attacks have emerged as particularly prominent, including as vectors for ransomware attacks, which have increased in breadth and frequency. While we train our employees as part of our security efforts, that training cannot be completely effective. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. It is possible that our IT systems and networks, or those managed by third parties such as cloud providers or suppliers that otherwise host confidential information, could have vulnerabilities, which could go unnoticed for a period of time. While our cybersecurity and compliance efforts seek to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we and our third-party service providers have implemented and are implementing, will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property. The potential impacts of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation, government enforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in IT systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. This could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition and, critically in light of our business model, loss of member confidence. Further, the insurance coverage we maintain and indemnification arrangements with third-parties may be inadequate to cover claims, costs, and liabilities relating to cybersecurity incidents. In addition, data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and other privacy and cybersecurity laws across the various states and around the globe, which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance. 11 Table of Contents We are subject to payment-related risks. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including select credit and debit cards, cash and checks, co-brand cardholder rebates, Executive member 2% reward certificates, and our shop card. As we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could disrupt our business if these parties become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to fee increases by these service providers. We must comply with evolving payment card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. We might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputation, and expose us to litigation. If our merchandise, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children ' s products, pet products and durable goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety or labeling standards or our members ' expectations, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of illness or injury to our members. Such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or faulty design. Our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause illness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image, and these effects could be long-term. If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media. We are making investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. 12 Table of Contents Inability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends on the continued contributions of our employees, including members of our senior management and other key operations, IT, merchandising and administrative personnel. Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for senior management could negatively impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including the continuing impacts of the pandemic, regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, union relations and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance. Claims for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations. Market and Other External Risks We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results. General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Higher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreign-currency exchange rates, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal 13 Table of Contents and tax policies including changes in tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, pandemics and other health crises, and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results. Prices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by events like the outbreak of hostilities, including but not limited to the Ukraine conflict, or acts of terrorism. Inflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If inflation on merchandise increases beyond our ability to control we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand. Certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years due to, among other things, the continuing impacts of the pandemic and uncertain economic environment. Suppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins. We depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions causing a loss of sales and profits. We buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new suppliers, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available. Our suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies, supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, packaging, legal, regulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business. 14 Table of Contents Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. During 2022, our international operations, including Canada, generated 27% and 32% of our net sales and operating income, respectively. Our international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. Future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our Canadian and Other International operations and have a corresponding adverse period-over-period effect on our results of operations. As we continue to expand internationally, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase. A portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold. Currency fluctuations may increase our merchandise costs and may not be passed on to members. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. Natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, including those impacted by climate change, such as hurricanes, typhoons, floods, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; energy shortages; public health issues, including pandemics and quarantines, particularly in California or Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our properties, limitations on store operating hours, less frequent visits by members to physical locations, the temporary closure of warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, disruptions to our IT systems, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or members, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in many respects. The continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile and are affecting certain business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things. 15 Table of Contents Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: • The severity and duration of the pandemic, including future mutations or related variants of the virus in areas in which we operate; • Evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; • Changes in labor markets affecting us and our suppliers; • Unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response; • The pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides; • The long-term impact of the pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors; and • Disruption and volatility within the financial and credit markets. To the extent that COVID-19 continues to adversely affect the U.S. and global economy, our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, brand reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, operational risk as a result of remote work arrangements and regulatory requirements. Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business. We use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. Government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. As the economy transitions to lower carbon intensity we cannot guarantee that we will make adequate investments or successfully implement strategies that will effectively achieve our climate-related goals, which could lead to negative perceptions among members and other stakeholders and result in reputational harm. Climate change, extreme weather conditions, wildfires, droughts and rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and increased regulations. More stringent fuel economy standards and public policies aimed at increasing the adoption of zero-emission and alternative fuel vehicles and other regulations related to climate change will affect our future operations and may adversely impact our profitability, and require significant capital expenditures. Failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. We believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new member sign-ups, gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the price of our stock to decline. Legal and Regulatory Risks We are subject to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. At the end of 2022, we operated 260 warehouses outside of the U.S., and we plan to continue expanding our international operations. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which are beyond our control. These factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, 16 Table of Contents policy changes such as the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions), monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. Accounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price. Changes in tax rates, new U.S. or foreign tax legislation, and exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at any point in time, we may be under examination for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may recognize additional tax expense, be subject to additional tax liabilities, or incur losses and penalties, due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Significant changes in or failure to comply with regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to a wide and increasingly broad array of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with these laws could result in harm to our members, employees or others, significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 17 Table of Contents Operations at our facilities require the treatment and disposal of wastewater, stormwater and agricultural and food processing wastes, the use and maintenance of refrigeration systems, including ammonia-based chillers, noise, odor and dust management, the operation of mechanized processing equipment, and other operations that potentially could affect the environment and public health and safety. Failure to comply with current and future environmental, health and safety standards could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, illness or injury of our employees, and claims or lawsuits related to such illnesses or injuries, and temporary closures or limits on the operations of facilities. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines, penalties, and remediation costs. We are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed property laws, and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these proceedings, audits, unclaimed property laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management ' s attention and resources. 18 Table of Contents Item 1B—Unresolved Staff Comments None.

MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally discusses the results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2021 compared to 2020 refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2021 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 6, 2021. Overview We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations); inflation and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, as well as passing cost increases on to our members. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near- 22 Table of Contents term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations. E-commerce sales growth slowed in 2022 compared to 2021 and 2020. The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2022, 2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. 23 Table of Contents Highlights for 2022 versus 2021 include: • We opened 26 new warehouses, including 3 relocations: 14 net new in the U.S., 2 net new in our Canadian segment, and 7 new in our Other International segment, compared to 22 new warehouses, including 2 relocations in 2021; • Net sales increased 16% to $222,730 driven by a 14% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2021 and 2022; • Membership fee revenue increased 9% to $4,224, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive membership, and an increase in our renewal rate; • Gross margin percentage decreased 65 basis points, driven primarily by our core merchandise categories and a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 77 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales and ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19, despite additional wage and benefits increases; • We incurred a one-time $77 pretax charge, primarily related to granting our employees one additional day of paid time off in March 2022; • The effective tax rate in 2022 was 24.6% compared to 24.0% in 2021; • Net income increased 17% to $5,844, or $13.14 per diluted share compared to $5,007, or $11.27 per diluted share in 2021; • In June 2022, the Company paid a cash dividend of $208 and purchased the remaining equity interest of its Taiwan operations from its former joint-venture partner for $842, totaling $1,050 in the aggregate; and • In April 2022, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.79 to $0.90 per share. COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our business during 2022, albeit to a lesser extent. COVID-related and other supply and logistics constraints have continued to adversely affect some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future. During 2021, we paid $515 in incremental wages related to COVID-19, which ceased in February 2021. 24 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 2022 2021 2020 Net Sales $ 222,730 $ 192,052 $ 163,220 Increases in net sales: U.S. 17 % 16 % 9 % Canada 16 % 22 % 5 % Other International 10 % 23 % 13 % Total Company 16 % 18 % 9 % Increases in comparable sales: U.S. 16 % 15 % 8 % Canada 15 % 20 % 5 % Other International 7 % 19 % 9 % Total Company 14 % 16 % 8 % Increases in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency and gasoline prices: U.S. 10 % 14 % 9 % Canada 12 % 12 % 7 % Other International 10 % 13 % 11 % Total Company 11 % 13 % 9 % Net Sales Net sales increased $30,678 or 16% during 2022. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 14%, and sales at new warehouses opened in 2021 and 2022. Sales increased $15,830 in core merchandise categories and $14,848 in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The rate of increase was strongest in our gasoline, business centers, and travel businesses. Sales continued to be impacted by inflation, higher than what we experienced in previous fiscal years. During 2022, higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $9,230, 481 basis points, compared to 2021, with a 42% increase in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 22%, positively impacting net sales by $3,847, 200 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $1,762, 92 basis points, compared to 2021, attributable primarily to our Other International operations. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 14% during 2022 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket, which includes the effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency. E-commerce comparable sales increased 10% during 2022, including inflation. 25 Table of Contents Membership Fees 2022 2021 2020 Membership fees $ 4,224 $ 3,877 $ 3,541 Membership fees increase 9 % 9 % 6 % Membership fee revenue increased 9% in 2022, driven by new member sign-ups and upgrades to Executive membership. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted membership fees by $42, compared to 2021. At the end of 2022, our member renewal rates were 93% in the U.S. and Canada and 90% worldwide. Renewal rates continue to benefit from more members auto renewing and increased penetration of Executive members, who on average renew at a higher rate. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Gross Margin 2022 2021 2020 Net sales $ 222,730 $ 192,052 $ 163,220 Less merchandise costs 199,382 170,684 144,939 Gross margin $ 23,348 $ 21,368 $ 18,281 Gross margin percentage 10.48 % 11.13 % 11.20 % Total gross margin percentage decreased 65 basis points compared to 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin was 10.94%, a decrease of 19 basis points. This was primarily due to a 33 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories, predominantly driven by decreases in fresh foods and foods and sundries, and 19 basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by one basis point due to increased 2% rewards. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses positively impacted gross margin by 29 basis points, predominantly gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce. Gross margin was positively impacted by five basis points due to the net impact of ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19 and the negative impact of a one-time charge related to granting our employees one additional day of paid time off. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $176, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International Operations. The gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 27 basis points. The decrease was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased across all segments. All segments were negatively impacted due to decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin in our U.S. segment was also negatively impacted by the LIFO charge. Our Other International segment was negatively impacted by increased 2% rewards. All segments benefited from the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19. 26 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2022 2021 2020 SG&A expenses $ 19,779 $ 18,537 $ 16,387 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 8.88 % 9.65 % 10.04 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 77 basis points compared to 2021. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was 9.26%, a decrease of 39 basis points. Warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by 17 basis points, largely attributable to leveraging increased sales. This includes the impact of the starting wage increase we instituted in October 2021, as well the increased wages and benefits that were effective on March 14, 2022, and July 4, 2022. SG&A expenses was benefited by a net of 16 basis points due to the positive impact of ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19, partially offset by higher write-offs of certain information technology assets, and expenses related to granting our employees one additional day of paid time off. Central operating costs were lower by five basis points, and stock compensation expense was lower by one basis point. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased SG&A expenses by approximately $148, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International operations. Interest Expense 2022 2021 2020 Interest expense $ 158 $ 171 $ 160 Interest expense primarily relates to Senior Notes and financing leases. Interest expense decreased in 2022 due to repayment of the 2.300% Senior Notes on December 1, 2021. For more information on our debt arrangements, refer to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 27 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes 2022 2021 2020 Provision for income taxes $ 1,925 $ 1,601 $ 1,308 Effective tax rate 24.6 % 24.0 % 24.4 % The effective tax rate for 2022 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $130. This included $94 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.2% for 2022. The effective tax rate for 2021 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $163. This included $75 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation, $70 related to the special cash dividend paid through our 401(k) plan, and $19 related to a reduction in the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. Excluding net discrete tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.4% for 2021. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,392 $ 8,958 $ 8,861 Net cash used in investing activities (3,915) (3,535) (3,891) Net cash used in financing activities (4,283) (6,488) (1,147) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $11,049 and $12,175 at the end of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $2,010 and $1,816 at the end of 2022 and 2021. These receivables generally settle within four days. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted cash and cash equivalents negatively by $249 in 2022, and positively by $46 and $70 in 2021 and 2020. Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. See Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for amounts outstanding on August 28, 2022, related to debt and leases. Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. Construction and land purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to the development and opening of new and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months. Management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows with capacity under existing and available credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $7,392 in 2022, compared to $8,958 in 2021. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by 28 Table of Contents several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with our suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts from suppliers. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $3,915 in 2022, compared to $3,535 in 2021, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Expenditures Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In 2022, we spent $3,891 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximat ely $3,800 to $4,000 d uring fiscal 2023. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 26 new warehous es, including three relocations, in 2022, and plan to open approximately up to 29 additional new warehouses, including four relocations, in 2023. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs or based on the economic environment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $4,283 in 2022, compared to $6,488 in 2021. Cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to the payment of dividends, payments to our former joint-venture partner for a dividend and the purchase of their equity interest in Taiwan, totaling $1,050 in the aggregate, repayments of our 2.300% Senior Notes, repurchases of common stock, and withholding taxes on stock awards. Stock Repurchase Programs During 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 863,000 and 1,358,000 shares of common stock, at average prices of $511.46 and $364.39, respectively, totaling approximately $442 and $495, respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $2,808 at the end of 2022. Dividends Cash dividends declared in 2022 totaled $3.38 per share, as compared to $12.98 per share in 2021. Dividends in 2021 included a special dividend of $10.00 per share, aggregating approximately $4,430. In April 2022, the Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.79 to $0.90 per share. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At August 28, 2022, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,257. Our international operations maintain $773 of this capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $176 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities were $88 and $41 at the end of 2022 and 2021. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $224. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2022 totaled $184, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these 29 Table of Contents facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities Claims for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to seek to limit exposures arising from very large losses. We use different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, and participate in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims. While we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Recent Accounting Pronouncements We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements. Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions) Our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents, as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short-term investments are in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. 30 Table of Contents Our policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, U.S. government and government agency money market funds, and insured bank balances. Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers’ acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies. A 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2022 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value. For those investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. The nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of 2022, long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $6,590. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt. Foreign Currency Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to the Company's forward foreign-exchange contracts, see Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2022, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $128 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to some of the fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment. 31 Table of Contents Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Page Reports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 33 Consolidated Statements of Income 36 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income 37 Consolidated Balance Sheets 38 Consolidated Statements of Equity 39 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 40 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 41 32 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Costco Wholesale Corporation: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the 52-week periods ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the 52-week periods ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of August 28, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated October 4, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 33 Table of Contents Evaluation of workers' compensation self-insurance liabilities As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated self-insurance liabilities as of August 28, 2022, were $1,364 million, a portion of which related to workers’ compensation self-insurance liabilities for the United States operations. We identified the evaluation of the Company’s workers’ compensation self-insurance liabilities for the United States operations as a critical audit matter because of the extent of specialized skill and knowledge needed to evaluate the underlying assumptions and judgments made by the Company in the actuarial models. Specifically, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company's selected loss rates and initial expected losses used in the actuarial models. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s self-insurance workers' compensation process. This included controls related to the development and selection of the assumptions listed above used in the actuarial calculation and review of the actuarial report. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in: • Assessing the actuarial models used by the Company for consistency with generally accepted actuarial standards • Evaluating the Company’s ability to estimate self-insurance workers' compensation liabilities by comparing its historical estimates with actual incurred losses and paid losses • Evaluating the above listed assumptions underlying the Company’s actuarial estimates by developing an independent expectation of the self-insurance workers' compensation liabilities and comparing them to the amounts recorded by the Company /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002. Seattle, Washington October 4, 2022 34 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Costco Wholesale Corporation: Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries ’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of August 28, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 28, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the 52-week periods ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020 , and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated October 4, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Seattle, Washington October 4, 2022 35 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (amounts in

in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At August 28, 2022, Costco operated 838 warehouses worldwide: 578 in the United States (U.S.) located in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 107 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 31 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 17 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 13 in Australia, four in Spain, two each in France and China, and one in Iceland. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. During 2022, the Company paid a cash dividend of $ 208 and purchased the equity interest of its Taiwan operations from its former joint-venture partner for $ 842 , totaling $ 1,050 in the aggregate. The remaining noncontrolling interest represents the portion of equity interests in a consolidated joint venture that is not 100% owned by the Company. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2022, 2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Reclassification Reclassifications were made to our 2021 and 2020 consolidated statements of income and cash flows to conform with current year presentation. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to four days. Credit and debit card receivables were $ 2,010 and $ 1,816 at the end of 2022 and 2021. 41 Table of Contents The Company provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as payments are presented. Included in accounts payable at the end of 2022 and 2021, are $ 995 and $ 999 representing the excess of outstanding payments over cash on deposit at the banks on which the payments were drawn. Short-Term Investments Short-term investments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. Government and Agency Notes), with maturities at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. These available-for-sale investments have a low level of inherent credit risk given they are issued by the U.S. Government and Agencies. Changes in their fair value are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and market liquidity. Short-term investments classified as held-to-maturity are financial instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis. The Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for credit impairment, using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be impaired as the result of a credit loss, the Company recognizes the loss in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2 , 3 , and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all other non-derivative financial instruments are based on independent external valuation information. The pricing process uses data from a variety of independent external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves including but not limited to treasury benchmarks and LIBOR or Secured Overnight Financing Rate and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable, using the fair 42 Table of Contents value of the individual securities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred. Current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities include the Company's long-term debt, which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs, and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt is based primarily on reported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon interest rates, maturities, and credit. Receivables, Net Receivables consist primarily of vendor, credit card incentive, reinsurance, third-party pharmacy and other receivables. Vendor receivables include discounts and volume rebates. Balances are generally presented on a gross basis, separate from any related payable due. In certain circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor, in which case the receivables are presented on a net basis. Credit card incentive receivables primarily represent amounts earned under the co-branded credit card arrangements in the U.S. and Canada. Reinsurance receivables are held by the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and primarily represent amounts ceded through reinsurance arrangements gross of the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members’ insurers. Other receivables primarily consist of amounts due from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items. The valuation allowance related to receivables was not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of 2022, 2021, and 2020. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories consist of the following: 2022 2021 United States $ 13,160 $ 10,248 Canada 1,966 1,456 Other International 2,781 2,511 Merchandise inventories $ 17,907 $ 14,215 Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and inventory levels have been determined. Due to inflation, a $ 438 charge was recorded during 2022 to merchandise costs to increase the cumulative LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories at August 28, 2022. An immaterial LIFO charge was recorded in 2021. Canadian and Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly valued using the cost and retail inventory methods, respectively, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts using estimates based on experience. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates, provided that they are probable and reasonably estimable. 43 Table of Contents Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization expense is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements made after the beginning of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease plus any renewals that are reasonably certain at the date the leasehold improvements are made. The Company capitalizes certain computer software and costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. During development, these costs are included in construction in progress. To the extent that the assets become ready for their intended use, these costs are included in equipment and fixtures and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. In 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized in SG&A expenses write-offs of $ 118 and $ 84 for certain information technology assets. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or change asset function or useful life are capitalized. Assets removed during the remodel, refurbishment or improvement are retired. Assets classified as held-for-sale at the end of 2022 and 2021 were immaterial. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances at the end of 2022 and 2021: Estimated Useful Lives 2022 2021 Land N/A $ 7,955 $ 7,507 Buildings and improvements 5 - 50 years 20,120 19,139 Equipment and fixtures 3 - 20 years 10,275 9,505 Construction in progress N/A 1,582 1,507 39,932 37,658 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 15,286 ) ( 14,166 ) Property and equipment, net $ 24,646 $ 23,492 The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in circumstances may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For asset groups held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In the event that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal to the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale (disposal group), the carrying value is compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisals from third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. There were no impairment charges recognized in 2022 or 2020. Impairment charges recognized in 2021 were immaterial. Leases The Company leases land, buildings, and/or equipment at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities. Leases generally contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair market value; or (c) a right of first refusal in the event of a third-party offer. 44 Table of Contents Some leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. Non-lease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for together as a single lease component for all asset classes. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. Impairment of ROU assets is evaluated in a similar manner as described in Property and Equipment, net above. The Company's asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that must be removed at the end of a lease. These obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability, with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term, based upon the estimated fair value of the costs to remove the improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same depreciation method as the leasehold improvement assets and are included with buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associated with these leases are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results. Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable segment: United States Canada Other International Total Balance at August 30, 2020 $ 947 $ 27 $ 14 $ 988 Changes in currency translation and other (1) 6 1 1 8 Balance at August 29, 2021 $ 953 $ 28 $ 15 $ 996 Changes in currency translation — ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) Balance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993 ____________ (1) Other consists of changes to the purchase price allocation. 45 Table of Contents Definite-lived intangible assets, which are not material, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit. Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities Claims for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The Company uses different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive) and participates in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of 2022 and 2021, these insurance liabilities were $ 1,364 and $ 1,257 in the aggregate, respectively, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature. The captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes other third-party participants. The reinsurance agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement of the next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program are designed to limit a participating members’ individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior activity. Derivatives The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts relate primarily to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding contracts upon certain triggering events. The aggregate fair value amounts of derivative instruments in a net liability position and the amount needed to settle the instruments immediately if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered were immaterial at the end of 2022. There were no derivative instruments in a net liability position at the end of 2021. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were $ 1,242 and $ 1,331 at the end of 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 3 for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2022 and 2021. The unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2022, 2021 and 2020. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodity products used in retail and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of 46 Table of Contents derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment. Foreign Currency The functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are their local currencies. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Revenues and expenses of the Company’s consolidated foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. The Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Generally, these include the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries revalued to their functional currency. Also included are realized foreign-currency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items were $ 84 in 2022 and immaterial in 2021 and 2020. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and member returns. The Company reserves for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods. The Company also provides expanded products and services through warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The majority of revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally is established when Costco is primarily responsible for merchandising decisions, pricing discretion, and maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member service and satisfaction. The Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. Deferred membership fees at the end of 2022 and 2021 were $ 2,174 and $ 2,042 , respectively. In most countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum value, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2022, 2021, and 2020, the net reduction in sales was $ 2,307 , $ 2,047 , and $ 1,707 respectively. 47 Table of Contents The Company sells and otherwise provides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for outstanding shop card balances as a shop card liability, net of estimated breakage. Shop card liabilities are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Citibank, N.A. became the exclusive issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members in June 2016. The Company receives various forms of consideration from Citibank, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco. A portion of the royalty is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receive, after taking into consideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. The Company also maintains co-branded credit card arrangements in Canada and certain other International subsidiaries. Merchandise Costs Merchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company’s depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses, and are reduced by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods and certain ancillary departments. Vendor Consideration The Company has agreements to receive funds from vendors for discounts and a variety of other programs. These programs are evidenced by signed agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebate or discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers’ compensation costs for warehouse employees (other than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses which are reflected in merchandise costs) as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, stock compensation expense, credit and debit card processing fees, utilities, preopening, as well as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse and e-commerce website operations. Retirement Plans The Company's 401(k) retirement plan is available to all U.S. employees over the age of 18 who have completed 90 days of employment. The plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. The Company also has a defined contribution plan for employees in Canada and contributes a percentage of each employee's wages. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations have defined benefit and defined contribution plans, which are not material. Amounts expensed under all plans were $ 824 , $ 748 , and $ 676 for 2022, 2021, and 2020, and are predominantly included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Stock-Based Compensation Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted to employees generally vest over five years and allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based awards that would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. Actual forfeitures are recognized as they occur. 48 Table of Contents Compensation expense for stock-based awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for the entire award. Awards for employees and non-employee directors provide for accelerated vesting based on cumulative years of service with the Company. Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long-service term. The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense is predominantly included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Certain stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 7 for additional information on the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized. The timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes as appropriate. Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco The computation of basic net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method for shares subject to RSUs. Stock Repurchase Programs Repurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and is applied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6 for additional information. 49 Table of Contents Note 2—Investments The Company’s investments were as follows: 2022: Cost Basis Unrealized Losses, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 534 $ ( 5 ) $ 529 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 317 — 317 Total short-term investments $ 851 $ ( 5 ) $ 846 2021: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 375 $ 6 $ 381 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 536 — 536 Total short-term investments $ 911 $ 6 $ 917 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the years ended August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021. At those dates, there were no available-for-sale securities in a material continuous unrealized-loss position. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during 2022 or 2021. The maturities of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities at the end of 2022 are as follows: Available-For-Sale Held-To-Maturity Cost Basis Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 276 $ 274 $ 317 Due after one year through five years 197 195 — Due after five years 61 60 — Total $ 534 $ 529 $ 317 50 Table of Contents Note 3—Fair Value Measurement Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The table below presents information regarding the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the level within the hierarchy reflecting the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. Level 2 2022 2021 Investment in government and agency securities (1) $ 529 $ 393 Forward foreign-exchange contracts, in asset position (2) 34 17 Forward foreign-exchange contracts, in (liability) position (2) ( 2 ) ( 2 ) Total $ 561 $ 408 ____________ (1) At August 29, 2021, $ 12 cash and cash equivalents and $ 381 short-term investments are included in the consolidated balance sheets. (2) The asset and the liability values are included in other current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. At August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, the Company did not hold any Level 1 or 3 financial assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between levels during 2022 or 2021. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. There were no fair value adjustments to nonfinancial assets during 2022 and in 2021 they were immaterial. Note 4—Debt Short-Term Borrowings The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $ 1,257 and $ 1,050 , in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Borrowings on these short-term facilities were immaterial during 2022 and 2021. Short-term borrowings outstanding were $ 88 and $ 41 at the end of 2022 and 2021. Long-Term Debt The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. On December 1, 2021, the Company repaid, prior to maturity, the 2.300 % Senior Notes at a redemption price plus accrued interest as specified in the Notes' agreement. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100 % of the principal amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain events, the holder has the right to require the Company to purchase this security at a price of 101 % of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the event. Interest on all outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.

Dividends in 2021 included a special dividend of $ 10.00 per share, aggregating approximately $ 4,430 . The Company's current quarterly dividend rate is $ 0.90 per share. Stock Repurchase Programs The Company's stock repurchase program is conducted under a $ 4,000 authorization by the Board of Directors, which expires in April 2023. As of the end of 2022, the remaining amount available under the approved plan was $ 2,808 . The following table summarizes the Company’s stock repurchase activity: Shares Repurchased (000’s) Average Price per Share Total Cost 2022 863 $ 511.46 $ 442 2021 1,358 364.39 495 2020 643 308.45 198 These amounts may differ from repurchases of common stock in the consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation The Company grants stock-based compensation, primarily to employees and non-employee directors. Grants to executive officers are generally performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approvals, there have been amended and restated plans and new provisions implemented by the Company. RSUs are subject to quarterly vesting upon retirement or voluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25 years of service with the Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting date. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares ( 10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate of 27,800,000 shares ( 15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes. Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity RSUs granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over five and three years, respectively. Additionally, the terms of the RSUs, including performance-based awards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained 25 or more and five or more years of service with the Company, respectively. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and undelivered shares. At the end of 2022, 10,445,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs under the 2019 Incentive Plan. 55 Table of Contents The following awards were outstanding at the end of 2022: • 3,328,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and • 121,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 82,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of performance targets for 2022. This determination occurred in September 2022, at which time at least 33% of the units vested, as a result of the long service of all executive officers receiving performance-based RSUs. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. The following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2022: Number of Units (in 000’s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at the end of 2021 4,349 $ 257.88 Granted 1,679 476.06 Vested and delivered ( 2,456 ) 290.18 Forfeited ( 123 ) 332.84 Outstanding at the end of 2022 3,449 $ 338.41 The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $ 476.06 , $ 369.15 , and $ 294.08 in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2022 was $ 758 and the weighted-average period of time over which this cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2022 were approximately 1,210,000 RSUs vested but not yet delivered. Summary of Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits: 2022 2021 2020 Stock-based compensation expense $ 724 $ 665 $ 619 Less recognized income tax benefit 154 140 128 Stock-based compensation expense, net $ 570 $ 525 $ 491 56 Table of Contents Note 8— Taxes Income Taxes Income before income taxes is comprised of the following: 2022 2021 2020 Domestic $ 5,759 $ 4,931 $ 4,204 Foreign 2,081 1,749 1,163 Total $ 7,840 $ 6,680 $ 5,367 The provisions for income taxes are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Federal: Current $ 798 $ 718 $ 616 Deferred ( 35 ) 84 77 Total federal 763 802 693 State: Current 333 265 230 Deferred ( 5 ) 11 8 Total state 328 276 238 Foreign: Current 851 557 372 Deferred ( 17 ) ( 34 ) 5 Total foreign 834 523 377 Total provision for income taxes $ 1,925 $ 1,601 $ 1,308 The reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2022, 2021, and 2020 is as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Federal taxes at statutory rate $ 1,646 21.0 % $ 1,403 21.0 % $ 1,127 21.0 % State taxes, net 267 3.4 243 3.6 190 3.6 Foreign taxes, net 231 3.0 92 1.4 92 1.7 Employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) ( 23 ) ( 0.3 ) ( 91 ) ( 1.3 ) ( 24 ) ( 0.5 ) Other ( 196 ) ( 2.5 ) ( 46 ) ( 0.7 ) ( 77 ) ( 1.4 ) Total $ 1,925 24.6 % $ 1,601 24.0 % $ 1,308 24.4 % The Company recognized total net tax benefits of $ 130 , $ 163 and $ 81 in 2022, 2021 and 2020. These include benefits of $ 94 , $ 75 and $ 77 , related to stock-based compensation. During 2021, there was a net tax benefit of $ 70 related to the portion of the special dividend paid through our 401(k) plan. 57 Table of Contents The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows: 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Equity compensation $ 84 $ 72 Deferred income/membership fees 302 161 Foreign tax credit carry forward 201 146 Operating lease liabilities 727 769 Accrued liabilities and reserves 694 681 Other 5 62 Total deferred tax assets 2,013 1,891 Valuation allowance ( 313 ) ( 214 ) Total net deferred tax assets 1,700 1,677 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment ( 962 ) ( 935 ) Merchandise inventories ( 231 ) ( 216 ) Operating lease right-of-use assets ( 701 ) ( 744 ) Foreign branch deferreds ( 85 ) ( 92 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 1,979 ) ( 1,987 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 279 ) $ ( 310 ) The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2022 and 2021 include deferred income tax assets of $ 445 and $ 444 , respectively, included in other long-term assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $ 724 and $ 754 , respectively, included in other long-term liabilities. In 2022 and 2021, the Company had valuation allowances of $ 313 and $ 214 , primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carry forwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030. The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries after 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested (other than China and Taiwan) and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The Company continues to consider undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $ 2,779 , to be indefinitely reinvested and has not provided for withholding or state taxes. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2022 and 2021 is as follows: 2022 2021 Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 33 $ 30 Gross increases—current year tax positions 1 2 Gross increases—tax positions in prior years 12 2 Gross decreases—tax positions in prior years ( 12 ) — Gross decreases—settlements ( 12 ) — Lapse of statute of limitations ( 6 ) ( 1 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 16 $ 33 58 Table of Contents The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2022 and 2021, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods is $ 15 and $ 30 at the end of 2022 and 2021. Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties recognized during 2022 and 2021, and accrued at the end of each respective period were not material. The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12 months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present. Other Taxes The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 59 Table of Contents Note 9—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of basic and of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000’s): 2022 2021 2020 Net income attributable to Costco $ 5,844 $ 5,007 $ 4,002 Weighted average basic shares 443,651 443,089 442,297 RSUs 1,106 1,257 1,604 Weighted average diluted shares 444,757 444,346 443,901 Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigations arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. The Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in an action commenced in July 2013 under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to employees who work at entrance and exit doors in California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2013-1-CV-248813; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. A bench trial was held in June and July; no decision has been issued.

In March 2019, employees filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods and itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-03454; C.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2019, the court issued an order denying class certification. In January 2020, the plaintiffs dismissed their Labor Code claims without prejudice, and the court remanded the action to state court. Settlement for an immaterial amount was agreed upon in February 2021. Final court approval of the settlement was granted on May 3, 2022. A proposed intervenor has appealed the denial of her motion to intervene. In May 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 2:19-cv-01340; E.D. Cal.). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees.

In August 2019, the plaintiff filed a companion case in state court seeking penalties under PAGA. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. FCS053454; Sonoma County Superior Court). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The state court action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal action. In December 2020, a former employee filed suit against the Company asserting collective and class claims on behalf of non-exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York Labor Law for failure to pay for all hours worked, failure to pay certain non-exempt employees on a weekly basis, and failure to provide proper wage statements and notices. The plaintiff also asserted individual retaliation claims. Cappadora v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 1:20-cv-06067; E.D.N.Y.). An amended complaint was filed, and the Company denied the material allegations of the amended complaint. Based on an agreement in principle concerning settlement of the matter, involving a proposed payment by the Company of an immaterial amount, the federal action has been dismissed. In April 2022, Cappadora and a second plaintiff filed an action against the Company in New York state court asserting the same class claims asserted in the federal action under the New York Labor Law and seeking preliminary approval of the class settlement. Cappadora and Sancho v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Index No. 604757/2022; Nassau County Supreme Court). In August 2021, a former employee filed a similar suit, asserting class claims on behalf of certain non-exempt employees under New York Labor Law for failure to pay on a weekly basis. Umadat v.

The Company filed an answer to the second 61 Table of Contents amended class action complaint, denying the material allegations. The Company also filed an answer to the PAGA representative action, denying the material allegations. In July 2021, a former temporary staffing employee filed a class action against the Company and a staffing company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, the timeliness of wages and final wages, and for unfair business practices. Dimas v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. STK-CV-UOE-2021-0006024; San Joaquin Superior Court).

The case has been stayed pending the motion to compel in the related case. In September 2021, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding the alleged failure to provide sick pay, failure to timely pay wages due at separation from employment, and for violations of California's unfair competition law. De Benning v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 34-2021-00309030-CU-OE-GDS; Sacramento Superior Court). The Company answered the complaint in January 2022, denying its material allegations.

In March 2022, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding the failure to: pay wages, provide meal and rest periods, provide accurate wage statements, timely pay final wages, and reimburse business expenses. Diaz v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 22STCV09513; Los Angeles Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations. In May 2022, an employee filed a PAGA-only representative action against the Company alleging claims under the California Labor Code regarding the payment of wages, meal and rest periods, the timeliness of wages and final wages, wage statements, accurate records and business expenses. Gonzalez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 22AHCV00255; Los Angeles Superior Court). Beginning in December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and a hospital in Texas, class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 43 states and American Samoa. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, Utah, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of the pending matters. Members of the Board of Directors, six corporate officers and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to chicken welfare and alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. Smith, et ano. v. Vachris, et al., Superior Court of the State of Washington, County of King, No, 22-2-08937-7SEA, (filed 6/14/22, as amended, 6/30/22); The complaint seeks from the individual defendants damages, injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys' fees. A motion to dismiss the amended complaint has been filed. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 62 Table of Contents Note 11—Segment Reporting The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Japan, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Spain, France, China, and Iceland. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1 . Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Effective for fiscal 2022, stock-based compensation was allocated to the segments in this reporting.

Item 9A—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 28, 2022, and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 28, 2022, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 28, 2022. The attestation of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is included with the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 64 Table of Contents Item 9B—Other Information None.

PART I Item 1—Business Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, France, Iceland, China, and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Costco operated 815, 795, and 782 warehouses worldwide at August 29, 2021, August 30, 2020, and September 1, 2019, respectively. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol “COST.” We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2021, 2020, and 2019 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 29, 2021, August 30, 2020, and September 1, 2019, respectively. General We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts. We buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. For our e- 3 Table of Contents commerce operations we ship merchandise through our depots, our logistics operations for big and bulky items, as well as through drop-ship and other delivery arrangements with our suppliers. Our average warehouse space is approximately 146,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations. Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, co-brand cardholder rebates, Executive member 2% reward certificates and our proprietary stored-value card (shop card). Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 9,000 to 11,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only. In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items. We offer merchandise and services in the following categories: Core Merchandise Categories (or core business): • Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and tobacco) • Non-Foods (previously Hardlines and Softlines; including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, garden and patio, sporting goods, tires, toys and seasonal, office supplies, automotive care, postage, tickets, apparel, small appliances, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry) • Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery) Warehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and Other Businesses (includes e-commerce, business centers, travel, and other) Warehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we have no gasoline business in Korea or China. We operated 636 gas stations at the end of 2021. Net sales for our gasoline business represented approximately 9% of total net sales in 2021. Our other businesses sell products and services that complement our warehouse operations (core and warehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services. Net sales for e-commerce represented approximately 7% of total net sales in 2021. This figure does not consider other services we offer online in certain countries such as business delivery, travel, same-day grocery, and various other services. Our business centers carry items tailored specifically for food services, convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries. Business centers are included in our total warehouse count. Costco Travel offers vacation 4 Table of Contents packages, hotels, cruises, and other travel products exclusively for Costco members (offered in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.). We have direct buying relationships with many producers of brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented supply constraints, including disruptions and delays that have impacted and could continue to impact the flow and availability of certain products. When sources of supply become unavailable, we seek alternative sources. We also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our members is significant. Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Membership Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and websites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or comparable document. Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $60 in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies in other countries. All paid memberships include a free household card. Our member renewal rate was 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 89% worldwide at the end of 2021. The majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. At the end of 2020, we standardized our membership count methodology globally to be consistent with the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in the addition to the count of approximately 2.0 million total cardholders for 2020, of which 1.3 million were paid members. The change did not impact 2019. Membership fee income and the renewal rate calculations were not affected. Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands): 2021 2020 2019 Gold Star 50,200 46,800 42,900 Business, including affiliates 11,500 11,300 11,000 Total paid members 61,700 58,100 53,900 Household cards 49,900 47,400 44,600 Total cardholders 111,600 105,500 98,500 Paid cardholders (except affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S. and Canada, for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive memberships are also available in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, for which the additional annual fee varies. Executive members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. This program also offers (except in Mexico and Korea), access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing. These services are generally provided by third parties and vary by state and country. Executive members totaled 25.6 million and represented 55% of paid members (excluding affiliates) in the U.S. and Canada and 17% of paid members (excluding affiliates) in our Other International operations at the end of 2021. They generally shop more frequently and spend more than other members. 5 Table of Contents Human Capital Our Code of Ethics requires that we “Take Care of Our Employees,” which is fundamental to the obligation to “Take Care of Our Members.” We must also carefully control our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, so that we can sell high quality goods and services at low prices. Compensation and benefits for employees is our largest expense after the cost of merchandise and is carefully monitored. At the end of 2021, we employed 288,000 employees worldwide. The large majority (approximately 95%) is employed in our membership warehouses and distribution channels and approximately 17,000 employees are represented by unions. We also utilize seasonal employees during peak periods. The total number of employees by segment is: Number of Employees 2021 2020 2019 United States 192,000 181,000 167,000 Canada 47,000 46,000 42,000 Other International 49,000 46,000 45,000 Total employees 288,000 273,000 254,000 We believe that our warehouses are among the most productive in the retail industry, owing in substantial part to the commitment and efficiency of our employees. We seek to provide them not merely with employment but careers. Many attributes of our business contribute to the objective; the more significant include: competitive compensation and benefits for those working in our membership warehouses and distributions channels; a commitment to promoting from within; and maintaining a ratio of at least 50% of our employee base being full-time employees. These attributes contribute to what we consider, especially for the industry, a high retention rate. In 2021, in the U.S. that rate was above 90% for employees who have been with us for at least one year. The commitment to “Take Care of Our Employees” is also the foundation of our approach to diversity, equity and inclusion and creating an inclusive and respectful workplace. In 2021, we added training and communication for managers on topics of race, bias and equity, and greater visibility of our employee demographics. Embracing differences is important to the growth of our Company. It leads to more opportunities, innovation, and employee satisfaction and connects us to the communities where we do business. Costco is firmly committed to helping protect the health and safety of our members and employees and to serving our communities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated challenges, we began providing premium pay to the majority of our hourly employees in March 2020 and continued for a full year through February 2021, at which time a portion of the premium was built permanently into our hourly wage scales in the U.S. In fall 2020, we also began offering employees additional paid time off to attend to child care and schooling needs through the 2021 school year. As the global effect of coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to evolve, we are closely monitoring the changing situation and complying with public health guidance. For more detailed information regarding our programs and initiatives, see “Employees” within our Sustainability Commitment (located on our website). This report and other information on our website are not incorporated by reference into and do not form any part of this Annual Report. 6 Table of Contents Competition Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution strategy, and customer service. We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors in the U.S. We also compete with other warehouse clubs including Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club, and many of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple clubs. Intellectual Property We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered at prices that are generally lower than national brands, and help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private-label items. We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.

We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management ' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Business and Operating Risks We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations. Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 86% and 81% of net sales and operating income in 2021, respectively. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 28% of U.S. net sales in 2021. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among other things: slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products. We may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets, and integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability. We seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance, member traffic, and profitability. We intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. We cannot ensure that new warehouses and new e-commerce websites will be profitable and future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected. 9 Table of Contents We have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of our supply chains and delivery channels. The effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than opening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return. Our failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations. Membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of Executive membership, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations. We sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected. Disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction. We depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. We also rely upon processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics or other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. Our e-commerce business depends heavily on third-party and in-house logistics providers and that business is negatively affected when these providers are unable to provide services in a timely fashion. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to environmental, social and governance practices) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns, or we may experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both of which would reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income. Availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital to our business. Failure to successfully execute IT projects and have IT systems available to our business would adversely impact our operations. IT systems play a crucial role in conducting our business. These systems are utilized to process a very high volume of transactions, conduct payment transactions, track and value our inventory and produce reports critical for making business decisions. Failure or disruption of these systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buy products and services from our suppliers, produce goods in our manufacturing plants, move the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to our members. We are undertaking large technology and IT transformation projects. The failure of these 10 Table of Contents projects could adversely impact our business plans and potentially impair our day to day business operations. Given the high volume of transactions we process, it is important that we build strong digital resiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, viruses, internal or external security breaches, errors by employees, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes. Any debilitating failure of our critical IT systems, data centers and backup systems would require significant investments in resources to restore IT services and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of business services, increased cost of moving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members. We are currently making substantial investments in maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or delay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business. Failure to deliver IT transformation efforts efficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst multiplying threat landscapes and in compliance with privacy and data protection regulations globally. Failure to do so could damage our business, including our reputation with members, suppliers and employees, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation and regulatory action. Increased security threats and more sophisticated cyber misconduct pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. We rely upon IT systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with virtually all of our business activities. Additionally, we collect, store and process sensitive information relating to our business, members, suppliers and employees. Operating these IT systems and networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Increased remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Threats designed to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks and data, both ours and third parties with whom we work, are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crimes and advanced persistent threats. Phishing attacks have emerged as particularly prominent, including as vectors for ransomware attacks, which have increased in breadth and frequency. While we train our employees as part of our security efforts, that training cannot be completely effective. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. It is possible that our IT systems and networks, or those managed by third parties such as cloud providers or suppliers that otherwise host confidential information, could have vulnerabilities, which could go unnoticed for a period of time. While our cybersecurity and compliance efforts seek to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we and our third-party service providers have implemented and are implementing, will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property. The potential impacts of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation, government enforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in IT systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. This could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition and, critically in light of our business model, loss of member confidence. Further, the insurance coverage we maintain and indemnification arrangements with third-parties may be inadequate to cover claims, costs, and liabilities relating to cybersecurity incidents. In addition, data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and other emerging privacy and cybersecurity laws across the various states and around the globe, which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance. 11 Table of Contents We are subject to payment-related risks. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including select credit and debit cards, cash and checks, co-brand cardholder rebates, Executive member 2% reward certificates, and our shop card. As we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could disrupt our business if these parties become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. We might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputation, and expose us to litigation. If our merchandise, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children ' s products, pet products and durable goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety or labeling standards or our members ' expectations, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of illness or injury to our members. Such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or faulty design. Our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause illness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image, and these effects could be long-term. If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media, particularly in the wake of COVID-19. We are making investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. 12 Table of Contents Inability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends on the continued contributions of our employees, including members of our senior management and other key operations, IT, merchandising and administrative personnel. Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for senior management could negatively impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including the continuing impacts of the pandemic, regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance. Claims for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations. Market and Other External Risks We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results. General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Higher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreign-currency exchange rates, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal 13 Table of Contents and tax policies including changes in tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, pandemics and other health crises, and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China, the United States and the United Kingdom, have raised the cost of many items and created uncertainty with respect to tariff impacts on the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results. Prices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by events like the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism. Inflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If inflation on merchandise increases beyond our ability to control we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand. Certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years due to, among other things, the continuing impacts of the pandemic and uncertain economic environment. Suppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins. We depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions causing a loss of sales and profits. We buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new suppliers, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available. Our suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies, supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, packaging, legal, regulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business. 14 Table of Contents Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. During 2021, our international operations, including Canada, generated 28% and 36% of our net sales and operating income, respectively. Our international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. Future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our Canadian and Other International operations and have a corresponding adverse period-over-period effect on our results of operations. As we continue to expand internationally, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase. A portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold. Currency fluctuations may increase our merchandise costs and may not be passed on to members. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. Natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, typhoons, floods, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; energy shortages; public health issues, including pandemics and quarantines, particularly in California or Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our properties, limitations on store operating hours, less frequent visits by members to physical locations, the temporary closure of warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, disruptions to our IT systems, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or members, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in many respects. The continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile and are affecting certain business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things. The pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and on our employees, members, suppliers and other people and entities with which we do business. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business and government shutdowns. The pandemic and any preventative or protective actions that governments or we may take may result in business disruption, reduced member traffic and reduced sales in certain merchandise categories, and increased operating expenses. The pandemic is continuing to impact the global supply chain, with restrictions and limitations on business activities causing disruption and delay, which have strained certain domestic and international supply chains, and could continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain products. Member demand for certain products has and may continue to fluctuate as the pandemic progresses and member 15 Table of Contents behaviors change, which may challenge our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. Similarly, increased demand for online purchases of products has impacted our fulfillment operations, resulting in delays in deliveries and lost sales from being out of stock for certain SKUs. Failure to appropriately respond, or the perception of an inadequate response to evolving events around the pandemic, could cause reputational harm to our brand and subject us to lost sales, as well as claims from employees, members, suppliers, regulators or other parties. Additionally, a future outbreak of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our facilities could result in temporary or sustained workforce shortages or facility closures, which would negatively impact our business and results of operations. Some jurisdictions have taken measures intended to expand the availability of workers compensation or to change the presumptions applicable to workers compensation measures. These actions may increase our exposure to claims and increase our costs. Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: • The severity and duration of the pandemic, including future mutations or related variants of the virus in areas in which we operate; • Evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; • Changes in labor markets affecting us and our suppliers; • Unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response; • The pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides. • The long-term impact of the pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors; and • Disruption and volatility within the financial and credit markets. To the extent that COVID-19 continues to adversely affect the U.S. and global economy, our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, brand reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, operational risk as a result of remote work arrangements and regulatory requirements. Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business. We use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. Government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. Climate change, extreme weather conditions, wildfires, droughts and rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which face increased regulation. Failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. We believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new member sign-ups, gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the price of our stock to decline. 16 Table of Contents Legal and Regulatory Risks We are subject to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. At the end of 2021, we operated 251 warehouses outside of the U.S., and we plan to continue expanding our international operations. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which are beyond our control. These factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, policy changes such as the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions), monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. Accounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price. Changes in tax rates, new U.S. or foreign tax legislation, and exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at any point in time, we may be under examination for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may recognize additional tax expense, be subject to additional tax liabilities, or incur losses and penalties, due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 17 Table of Contents Significant changes in or failure to comply with regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to a wide and increasingly broad array of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with these laws could result in harm to our members, employees or others, significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Operations at our facilities require the treatment and disposal of wastewater, stormwater and agricultural and food processing wastes, the use and maintenance of refrigeration systems, including ammonia-based chillers, noise, odor and dust management, the operation of mechanized processing equipment, and other operations that potentially could affect the environment and public health and safety. Failure to comply with current and future environmental, health and safety standards could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, illness or injury of our employees, and claims or lawsuits related to such illnesses or injuries, and temporary closures or limits on the operations of facilities. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines, penalties, and remediation costs. We are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed property laws, and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these proceedings, audits, unclaimed property laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management ' s attention and resources. 18 Table of Contents Item 1B—Unresolved Staff Comments None.

MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally discusses the results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2020 compared to 2019 refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2020 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 7, 2020. In 2021, we combined the hardlines and softlines merchandise categories into non-foods. This change did not have a material impact on the discussion of our results of operations. Overview We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (includes e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China, the United States and the United Kingdom, have created 22 Table of Contents uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations. The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack an e-commerce business. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2021, 2020, and 2019 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 29, 2021, August 30, 2020, and September 1, 2019, respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. 23 Table of Contents Highlights for 2021 included: • We opened 22 new warehouses, including 2 relocations: 12 net new in the U.S., 4 net new in our Canadian segment, and 4 new in our Other International segment, compared to 16 new warehouses, including 3 relocations in 2020; • Net sales increased 18% to $192,052 driven by a 16% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2020 and 2021; • Membership fee revenue increased 9% to $3,877, driven by sign-ups and upgrades to Executive membership; • Gross margin percentage decreased seven basis points, driven primarily by a shift in sales penetration from our core merchandise categories to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales and decreased incremental wages related to COVID-19; • The effective tax rate in 2021 was 24.0% compared to 24.4% in 2020; • Net income increased 25% to $5,007, or $11.27 per diluted share compared to $4,002, or $9.02 per diluted share in 2020; • We paid a special cash dividend of $10.00 per share in December 2020 and in April 2021, increased the quarterly cash dividend from $0.70 to $0.79 per share totaling $5,748. COVID-19 During 2021, our sales mix began returning to pre-pandemic levels. This included sales increases in non-foods and in many of our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, certain of which experienced closures or restrictions in 2020. COVID-related supply and logistics constraints have adversely affected some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future. We paid $515 in incremental wages during 2021 related to COVID-19. The incremental wage and benefit costs associated with COVID-19, which began on March 1, 2020 and ended on February 28, 2021, totaled approximately $825. Effective March 1, 2021, we permanently increased wages for hourly and most salaried warehouse employees. The estimated annualized pre-tax cost is approximately $400. Additionally, in certain areas in the United States governments have mandated or are considering mandating extra pay for classes of employees that include our employees, which has and will result in higher costs. 24 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 2021 2020 2019 Net Sales $ 192,052 $ 163,220 $ 149,351 Increases in net sales: U.S. 16 % 9 % 9 % Canada 22 % 5 % 3 % Other International 23 % 13 % 5 % Total Company 18 % 9 % 8 % Increases in comparable sales: U.S. 15 % 8 % 8 % Canada 20 % 5 % 2 % Other International 19 % 9 % 2 % Total Company 16 % 8 % 6 % Increases in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency and gasoline prices (1) : U.S. 14 % 9 % 6 % Canada 12 % 7 % 5 % Other International 13 % 11 % 6 % Total Company 13 % 9 % 6 % _______________ (1) Excluding the impact of the revenue recognition standard for the year ended September 1, 2019. Net Sales Net sales increased $28,832 or 18% during 2021. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 16%, and sales at new warehouses opened in 2020 and 2021. While sales in all core merchandise categories increased, sales were particularly strong in non-foods. Sales increases were also strong in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce and gasoline. Certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $2,759, or 169 basis points, compared to 2020, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. Changes in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $1,636, or 100 basis points, compared to 2020, due to a 12% increase in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 10%, positively impacting net sales by $1,469, or 90 basis points. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 16% during 2021 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket. There was an increase of 44% in e-commerce comparable sales in 2021, driven by an increase of 80% in the first half of the year. 25 Table of Contents Membership Fees 2021 2020 2019 Membership fees $ 3,877 $ 3,541 $ 3,352 Membership fees increase 9 % 6 % 7 % Membership fees increased 9% in 2021, driven by sign-ups and upgrades to Executive membership. Excluding the positive impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, membership fees increased 8%. At the end of 2021, our member renewal rates were 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 89% worldwide. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Gross Margin 2021 2020 2019 Net sales $ 192,052 $ 163,220 $ 149,351 Less merchandise costs 170,684 144,939 132,886 Gross margin $ 21,368 $ 18,281 $ 16,465 Gross margin percentage 11.13 % 11.20 % 11.02 % The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The increase was across all categories, most significantly in non-foods. Total gross margin percentage decreased seven basis points compared to 2020. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales in 2021, gross margin percentage was 11.22%, an increase of two basis points. This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce. The comparison was also positively impacted by a three basis point reserve on inventory recorded in 2020 with no such reserve this year. Gross margin percentage was negatively impacted three basis points due to increased 2% rewards and two basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted gross margin by approximately $301 in 2021. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased in our U.S. segment, due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, our core merchandise categories, and the LIFO charge, partially offset by the reserve for certain inventory in 2020. Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories. These increases were partially offset by increased 2% rewards. 26 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2021 2020 2019 SG&A expenses $ 18,461 $ 16,332 $ 14,994 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 9.61 % 10.01 % 10.04 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points compared to 2020. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was 9.69%, a decrease of 32 basis points. Warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by 24 basis points, largely attributable to payroll leveraging increased sales. Incremental wages as a result of COVID-19, which ended on February 28, 2021, were lower by eight basis points. Central operating costs were lower by five basis points. Stock compensation expense was lower by three basis points, and costs associated with the acquisition of Innovel were lower by one basis point. These decreases were offset by an increase of five basis points related to a partial reversal of a product tax assessment in 2020, as well as an increase of four basis points related to a write-off of certain information technology assets in the fourth quarter of 2021 that are no longer expected to be utilized as part of the modernization of our information systems. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased our SG&A expenses by approximately $228 in 2021. Preopening 2021 2020 2019 Preopening expenses $ 76 $ 55 $ 86 Warehouse openings, including relocations United States 13 9 18 Canada 5 4 3 Other International 4 3 4 Total warehouse openings, including relocations 22 16 25 Preopening expenses include startup costs for new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses and corporate facilities. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse and facility openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market. Interest Expense 2021 2020 2019 Interest expense $ 171 $ 160 $ 150 Interest expense primarily relates to Senior Notes.

Excluding these benefits, the tax rate was 26.4% for 2021. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 2021 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 8,958 $ 8,861 $ 6,356 Net cash used in investing activities (3,535) (3,891) (2,865) Net cash used in financing activities (6,488) (1,147) (1,147) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $12,175 and $13,305 at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $1,816 and $1,636 at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively. These receivables generally settle within four days. Cash and cash equivalents were positively impacted by a change in exchange rates of $46 and $70 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and negatively impacted by $15 in 2019. Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. See Notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for amounts outstanding on August 29, 2021, related to debt and leases. Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. Construction and land purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to the development and opening of new and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months. 28 Table of Contents Management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows as well as capacity under existing and available credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $8,958 in 2021, compared to $8,861 in 2020. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with our suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts from suppliers. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $3,535 in 2021, compared to $3,891 in 2020, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. In 2020, we acquired Innovel (Costco Wholesale Logistics) and a minority interest in Navitus. Net cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Expenditures Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In 2021, we spent $3,588 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximat ely $3,800 to $4,200 d uring fiscal 2022. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 22 new warehous es, including two relocations, in 2021, and plan to open approximately up to 35 additional new warehouses, including five relocations, in 2022. We have experienced delays in real estate and construction activities due to COVID-19. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs or based on the current economic environment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $6,488 in 2021, compared to $1,147 in 2020. Cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to the payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, and withholding taxes on stock-based awards. In 2020, we issued $4,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and repaid $3,200 of Senior Notes. Stock Repurchase Programs During 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 1,358,000 and 643,000 shares of common stock, at average prices of $364.39 and $308.45, respectively, totaling approximately $495 and $198, respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,250 at the end of 2021. 29 Table of Contents Dividends Cash dividends declared in 2021 totaled $12.98 per share, as compared to $2.70 per share in 2020. Dividends in 2021 included a special dividend of $10.00 per share, resulting in an aggregate payment of approximately $4,430. In April 2021, the Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.70 to $0.79 per share. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At August 29, 2021, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,050. Our international operations maintain $574 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $201 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2021 were immaterial, and there were none outstanding at the end of 2020. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $235. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2021 totaled $197, most of which were standby letters of credit which do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities Claims for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to seek to limit exposures arising from very large losses. We use different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, and participate in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims over time. While we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Recent Accounting Pronouncements We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions) Our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents, as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short-term investments are in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. Our policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, U.S. government and government agency money market funds, and insured bank balances. Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers’ acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies. A 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2021 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value. For those investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. The nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of 2021, long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $7,531. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt. Foreign Currency Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to the Company's forward foreign-exchange contracts, see Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2021, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $149 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount. 31 Table of Contents Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to some of the fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment. 32 Table of Contents Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Costco Wholesale Corporation: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 29, 2021 and August 30, 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 52-week periods ended August 29, 2021, August 30, 2020 and September 1, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 29, 2021 and August 30, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the 52-week periods ended August 29, 2021, August 30, 2020 and September 1, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of August 29, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated October 5, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle The Company changed its method of accounting for leases as of September 2, 2019, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 – Leases (ASC 842). Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 33 Table of Contents Evaluation of workers' compensation self-insurance liabilities As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated self-insurance liabilities as of August 29, 2021 were $1,257 million, a portion of which related to workers’ compensation self-insurance liabilities for the United States operations. We identified the evaluation of the Company’s workers’ compensation self-insurance liabilities for the United States operations as a critical audit matter because of the extent of specialized skill and knowledge needed to evaluate the underlying assumptions and judgments made by the Company in the actuarial models. Specifically, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company's selected loss rates and initial expected losses used in the actuarial models. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s self-insurance workers' compensation process. This included controls related to the development and selection of the assumptions listed above used in the actuarial calculation and review of the actuarial report. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in: • Assessing the actuarial models used by the Company for consistency with generally accepted actuarial standards • Evaluating the Company’s ability to estimate self-insurance workers' compensation liabilities by comparing its historical estimates with actual incurred losses and paid losses • Evaluating the above listed assumptions underlying the Company’s actuarial estimates by developing an independent expectation of the self-insurance workers' compensation liabilities and comparing them to the amounts recorded by the Company /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002. Seattle, Washington October 5, 2021 34 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Costco Wholesale Corporation: Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries ’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of August 29, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 29, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of August 29, 2021 and August 30, 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 52-week periods ended August 29, 2021, August 30, 2020 and September 1, 2019 , and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated October 5, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Seattle, Washington October 5, 2021 35 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (amounts in

except share, per share, and warehouse count data) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At August 29, 2021, Costco operated 815 warehouses worldwide: 564 in the United States (U.S.) located in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 105 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 30 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 16 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 12 in Australia, three in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France and China. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2021, 2020, and 2019 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 29, 2021, August 30, 2020, and September 1, 2019, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public and private sector policies and initiatives. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to four days. Credit and debit card receivables were $ 1,816 and $ 1,636 at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively. 41 Table of Contents The Company provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as payments are presented. Included in accounts payable at the end of 2021 and 2020, are $ 999 and $ 810 , respectively, representing the excess of outstanding payments over cash on deposit at the banks on which the payments were drawn. Short-Term Investments Short-term investments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. Government and Agency Notes), with maturities at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. These available-for-sale investments have a low level of inherent credit risk given they are issued by the U.S. Government and Agencies. Changes in their fair value are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and market liquidity. Short-term investments classified as held-to-maturity are financial instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis. The Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for credit impairment, using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be impaired as the result of a credit loss, the Company recognizes the loss in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 3 , 4 , and 5 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all other non-derivative financial instruments are based on independent external valuation information. The pricing process uses data from a variety of independent external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves including but not limited to treasury benchmarks and LIBOR or Secured Overnight Financing Rate and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable, using the fair 42 Table of Contents value of the individual securities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred. Current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities include the Company's long-term debt, which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs, and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt is based primarily on reported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon interest rates, maturities, and credit. Receivables, Net Receivables consist primarily of vendor, reinsurance, credit card incentive, third-party pharmacy and other receivables. Vendor receivables include discounts and volume rebates. Balances are generally presented on a gross basis, separate from any related payable due. In certain circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor, in which case the receivables are presented on a net basis. Reinsurance receivables are held by the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and primarily represent amounts ceded through reinsurance arrangements gross of the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Credit card incentive receivables primarily represent amounts earned under the co-branded credit card arrangement in the U.S. Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members’ insurers. Other receivables primarily consist of amounts due from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items. Receivables are recorded net of an allowance for credit losses which considers creditworthiness of vendors and third parties, historical experience and current economic trends. Write-offs of receivables were immaterial in 2021, 2020, and 2019. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories consist of the following: 2021 2020 United States $ 10,248 $ 8,871 Canada 1,456 1,310 Other International 2,511 2,061 Merchandise inventories $ 14,215 $ 12,242 Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and inventory levels have been determined. An immaterial charge was recorded to merchandise costs to increase the cumulative LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories at August 29, 2021. As of August 30, 2020, U.S. merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated first-in, first-out (FIFO) after considering the lower of cost or market principle. Canadian and Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly valued using the cost and retail inventory methods, respectively, using the FIFO basis. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts using estimates based on experience. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates, provided that they are probable and reasonably estimable. 43 Table of Contents Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization expense is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements made after the beginning of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease plus any renewals that are reasonably certain at the date the leasehold improvements are made. The Company capitalizes certain computer software and costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. During development, these costs are included in construction in progress. To the extent that the assets become ready for their intended use, these costs are included in equipment and fixtures and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized an $ 84 write-off of certain information technology assets, which was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the consolidated statements of income. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or change the way an asset functions or that extend the useful life are capitalized. Assets removed during the remodel, refurbishment or improvement are retired. Assets classified as held-for-sale at the end of 2021 and 2020 were immaterial. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances at the end of 2021 and 2020: Estimated Useful Lives 2021 2020 Land N/A $ 7,507 $ 6,696 Buildings and improvements 5-50 years 19,139 17,982 Equipment and fixtures 3-20 years 9,505 8,749 Construction in progress N/A 1,507 1,276 37,658 34,703 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 14,166 ) ( 12,896 ) Property and equipment, net $ 23,492 $ 21,807 The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in circumstances may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For asset groups held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In the event that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal to the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale (disposal group), the carrying value is compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisals from third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. Impairment charges recognized in 2021 were immaterial. There were no impairment charges recognized in 2020 or 2019. Leases The Company leases land and/or buildings at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities. Leases generally contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair market value; or (c) a right of first refusal in the event of a third-party offer. 44 Table of Contents Some leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. Impairment of ROU assets is evaluated in a similar manner as described in Property and Equipment, net above. The Company's asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that at the end of a lease must be removed. These obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability, with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term based upon the estimated fair value of the costs to remove the improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same depreciation method as the leasehold improvement assets and are included with buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associated with these leases are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results. Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable segment: United States Operations Canadian Operations Other International Operations Total Balance at September 1, 2019 $ 13 $ 27 $ 13 $ 53 Changes in currency translation — — 1 1 Acquisition 934 — — 934 Balance at August 30, 2020 $ 947 $ 27 $ 14 $ 988 Changes in currency translation and other (1) 6 1 1 8 Balance at August 29, 2021 $ 953 $ 28 $ 15 $ 996 ____________ (1) Other consists of changes to the purchase price allocation. See Note 2 . 45 Table of Contents Definite-lived intangible assets, which are not material, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit. Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities Claims for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The Company uses different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive) and participates in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of 2021 and 2020, these insurance liabilities were $ 1,257 and $ 1,188 in the aggregate, respectively, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature. The captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes other third-party participants. The reinsurance agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement of the next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program limit a participating members’ individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior activity. Derivatives The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts relate primarily to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding contracts upon certain triggering events. There were no derivative instruments in a net liability position at the end of 2021 and for those in a net liability position at the end of 2020, the amount needed to settle the instruments immediately if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered was immaterial. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were $ 1,331 and $ 1,036 at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 4 for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2021 and 2020. The unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodity products used in retail and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of 46 Table of Contents derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment. Foreign Currency The functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Revenues and expenses of the Company’s consolidated foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. The Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Generally, these include the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries revalued to their functional currency. Also included are realized foreign-currency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items were immaterial in 2021, 2020, and 2019. Revenue Recognition The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09 in 2019, which provided for changes in the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and member returns. The Company reserves for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods (previously hardlines and softlines), and fresh foods. The Company also provides expanded products and services through warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The majority of revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally is established when Costco is primarily responsible for merchandising decisions, maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member service and satisfaction, and has pricing discretion. The Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. Deferred membership fees at the end of 2021 and 2020 were $ 2,042 and $ 1,851 , respectively. In most countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum value, which does not expire and can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2021, 2020, and 2019, the net reduction in sales was $ 2,047 , $ 1,707 , and $ 1,537 respectively. 47 Table of Contents The Company sells and otherwise provides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for outstanding shop card balances as a shop card liability, net of estimated breakage. Shop card liabilities are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Citibank, N.A. became the exclusive issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members in June 2016. The Company receives various forms of consideration, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco, a portion of which, after giving rise to estimated breakage, is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receive. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. Breakage is estimated based on redemption data. Merchandise Costs Merchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company’s depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses, and are reduced by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods and certain ancillary departments. Vendor Consideration The Company has agreements to receive funds from vendors for discounts and a variety of other programs. These programs are evidenced by signed agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebate or discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers’ compensation costs for warehouse employees (other than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses which are reflected in merchandise costs) as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, stock compensation expense, credit and debit card processing fees, utilities, as well as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse and e-commerce website operations. Retirement Plans The Company's 401(k) retirement plan is available to all U.S. employees over the age of 18 who have completed 90 days of employment. The plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. The Company also has a defined contribution plan for Canadian employees and contributes a percentage of each employee's wages. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations have defined benefit and defined contribution plans, which are not material. Amounts expensed under all plans were $ 748 , $ 676 , and $ 614 for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and are predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Stock-Based Compensation RSUs granted to employees generally vest over five years and allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based awards that would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. Actual forfeitures are recognized as they occur. 48 Table of Contents Compensation expense for stock-based awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for the entire award. Awards for employees and non-employee directors provide for accelerated vesting based on cumulative years of service with the Company. Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long-service term. The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense is predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Certain stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 8 for additional information on the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses include startup costs for new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses and corporate facilities and are expensed as incurred. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized. The timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes as appropriate. Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco The computation of basic net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method for shares subject to RSUs. Stock Repurchase Programs Repurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and is applied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 7 for additional information. 49 Table of Contents Note 2—Acquisition of Innovel On March 17, 2020, the Company acquired Innovel Solutions for $ 999 , using existing cash and cash equivalents. Innovel (now known as Costco Wholesale Logistics or CWL) provides final-mile delivery, installation and white-glove capabilities for big and bulky products in the United States and Puerto Rico. Its financial results have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The net purchase price of $ 999 has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets of $ 294 and liabilities assumed of $ 235 , based on fair values on the acquisition date. The remaining unallocated net purchase price of $ 940 was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the acquisition's benefits to the Company, which include the ability to serve more members and improve delivery times, enabling growth in certain segments of our U.S. e-commerce operations. The Company assigned this goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes, to reporting units within the U.S. segment. Changes to the purchase price allocation originally recorded in 2020 were not material. Note 3—Investments The Company’s investments were as follows: 2021: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 375 $ 6 $ 381 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 536 — 536 Total short-term investments $ 911 $ 6 $ 917 2020: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 436 $ 12 $ 448 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 580 — 580 Total short-term investments $ 1,016 $ 12 $ 1,028 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the years ended August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020. At the end of 2021 and 2020, there were no available-for-sale securities in a continuous unrealized-loss position. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during 2021 or 2020. The maturities of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities at the end of 2021 are as follows: Available-For-Sale Held-To-Maturity Cost Basis Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 190 $ 191 $ 536 Due after one year through five years 185 190 — Total $ 375 $ 381 $ 536 50 Table of Contents Note 4—Fair Value Measurement Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The table below presents information regarding the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the level within the hierarchy reflecting the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. Level 2 2021 2020 Investment in government and agency securities (1) $ 393 $ 508 Forward foreign-exchange contracts, in asset position (2) 17 1 Forward foreign-exchange contracts, in (liability) position (2) ( 2 ) ( 21 ) Total $ 408 $ 488 ____________ (1) At August 29, 2021, $ 12 cash and cash equivalents and $ 381 short-term investments are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At August 30, 2020, $ 60 cash and cash equivalents and $ 448 short-term investments are included in the consolidated balance sheets. (2) The asset and the liability values are included in other current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. At August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, the Company did not hold any Level 1 or 3 financial assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between levels during 2021 or 2020. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. Fair value adjustments to nonfinancial assets during 2021 were immaterial and there were no fair value adjustments to these items during 2020. Note 5—Debt Short-Term Borrowings The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $ 1,050 and $ 967 , in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Borrowings on these short-term facilities were immaterial during 2021 and 2020. Short-term borrowings outstanding were $ 41 at the end of 2021. There were no outstanding balances at the end of 2020. Long-Term Debt The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100 % of the principal amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain events, the holder has the right to require the Company to purchase this security at a price of 101 % of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the event. Interest on all outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs. Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In June 2021, the Japanese subsidiary repaid approximately $ 94 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes. 51 Table of Contents In April 2020, the Company issued $ 4,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes as follows: $ 1,250 of 1.375 % due June 2027; $ 1,750 of 1.600 % due April 2030; and $ 1,000 of 1.750 % due April 2032. In May 2020, a portion of the proceeds from the issuance were used to repay, prior to maturity, the outstanding $ 1,000 and $ 500 principal balances and interest on the 2.150 % and 2.250 % Senior Notes, respectively. The early redemption resulted in a $ 36 charge which was recorded in interest income and other, net in 2020. At the end of 2021 and 2020, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $ 7,692 and $ 7,987 , respectively. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following: 2021 2020 2.300% Senior Notes due May 2022 $ 800 $ 800 2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 1,000 1,000 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1,000 1,000 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1,250 1,250 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1,750 1,750 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 1,000 1,000 Other long-term debt 731 857 Total long-term debt 7,531 7,657 Less unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 40 48 Less current portion (1) 799 95 Long-term debt, excluding current portion $ 6,692 $ 7,514 _______________ (1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.

(2) Excludes $ 665 of lease payments for leases that have been signed but not commenced. 54 Table of Contents Note 7—Equity Dividends Cash dividends declared in 2021 totaled $ 12.98 per share, as compared to $ 2.70 per share in 2020. Dividends in 2021 included a special dividend of $ 10.00 per share, resulting in an aggregate payment of approximately $ 4,430 . The Company's current quarterly dividend rate is $ 0.79 per share. Stock Repurchase Programs The Company's stock repurchase program is conducted under a $ 4,000 authorization by the Board of Directors, which expires in April 2023. As of the end of 2021, the remaining amount available under the approved plan was $ 3,250 . The following table summarizes the Company’s stock repurchase activity: Shares Repurchased (000’s) Average Price per Share Total Cost 2021 1,358 $ 364.39 $ 495 2020 643 308.45 198 2019 1,097 225.16 247 These amounts may differ from repurchases of common stock in the consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Note 8—Stock-Based Compensation The Company grants stock-based compensation, primarily to employees and non-employee directors. Grants to all executive officers are generally performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approvals, there have been amended and restated plans and new provisions implemented by the Company. RSUs are subject to quarterly vesting upon retirement or voluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25 years of service with the Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting date. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares ( 10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate of 27,800,000 shares ( 15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes. In conjunction with a special cash dividend paid in the second quarter of 2021, and in accordance with the plans, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of 1.019 (rounded up to a whole share), representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $ 391.77 on November 30, 2020, which was the last trading day immediately prior to the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $ 384.50 on the ex-dividend date, December 1, 2020. The outstanding RSUs increased by approximately 94,000 . The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not change. As further required by the plans, the maximum number of shares issuable was proportionally adjusted, which resulted in an additional 220,000 RSU shares available to be granted. 55 Table of Contents Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity RSUs granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over five and three years, respectively. Additionally, the terms of the RSUs, including performance-based awards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained 25 or more and five or more years of service with the Company, respectively. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and undelivered shares. At the end of 2021, 12,001,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs under the 2019 Incentive Plan. The following awards were outstanding at the end of 2021: • 4,218,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and • 131,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 104,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of performance targets for 2021. This determination occurred in September 2021, at which time at least 33% of the units vested, as a result of the long service of all executive officers. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. The following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2021: Number of Units (in 000’s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at the end of 2020 5,174 $ 207.55 Granted 1,982 369.15 Vested and delivered ( 2,764 ) 235.64 Forfeited ( 137 ) 253.53 Special cash dividend 94 N/A Outstanding at the end of 2021 4,349 $ 257.88 The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $ 369.15 , $ 294.08 , and $ 224.00 in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2021 was $ 728 and the weighted-average period of time over which this cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2021 were approximately 1,516,000 RSUs vested but not yet delivered. Summary of Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits: 2021 2020 2019 Stock-based compensation expense $ 665 $ 619 $ 595 Less recognized income tax benefit 140 128 128 Stock-based compensation expense, net $ 525 $ 491 $ 467 56 Table of Contents Note 9— Taxes Income Taxes Income before income taxes is comprised of the following: 2021 2020 2019 Domestic $ 4,931 $ 4,204 $ 3,591 Foreign 1,749 1,163 1,174 Total $ 6,680 $ 5,367 $ 4,765 The provisions for income taxes are as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Federal: Current $ 718 $ 616 $ 328 Deferred 84 77 222 Total federal 802 693 550 State: Current 265 230 178 Deferred 11 8 26 Total state 276 238 204 Foreign: Current 557 372 405 Deferred ( 34 ) 5 ( 98 ) Total foreign 523 377 307 Total provision for income taxes $ 1,601 $ 1,308 $ 1,061 Except for certain provisions, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act) was effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Most provisions became effective for the Company for 2019, including limitations on the ability to claim foreign tax credits, repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction, and limitations on certain business deductions. Provisions with significant impacts that were effective starting in the second quarter of 2018 and throughout 2019 included: a lower U.S. federal income tax rate, remeasurement of certain net deferred tax liabilities, and a transition tax on deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings. The lower U.S. tax rate of 21.0 % was effective for all of 2021, 2020, and 2019. The reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Federal taxes at statutory rate $ 1,403 21.0 % $ 1,127 21.0 % $ 1,001 21.0 % State taxes, net 243 3.6 190 3.6 171 3.6 Foreign taxes, net 92 1.4 92 1.7 ( 1 ) — Employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) ( 91 ) ( 1.3 ) ( 24 ) ( 0.5 ) ( 18 ) ( 0.4 ) 2017 Tax Act — — — — ( 123 ) ( 2.6 ) Other ( 46 ) ( 0.7 ) ( 77 ) ( 1.4 ) 31 0.7 Total $ 1,601 24.0 % $ 1,308 24.4 % $ 1,061 22.3 % 57 Table of Contents During 2019, the Company recognized net tax benefits of $ 123 related to the 2017 Tax Act. This benefit included $ 105 related to U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends, partially offset by losses of current year foreign tax credits. The Company recognized total net tax benefits of $ 163 , $ 81 and $ 221 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These include benefits of $ 75 , $ 77 and $ 59 , respectively, related to the stock-based compensation accounting standard adopted in 2018, in addition to the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act noted above. During 2021, there was a net tax benefit of $ 70 related to the portion of the special dividend paid through our 401(k) plan. The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows: 2021 2020 Deferred tax assets: Equity compensation $ 72 $ 80 Deferred income/membership fees 161 144 Foreign tax credit carry forward 146 101 Operating lease liabilities 769 832 Accrued liabilities and reserves 681 639 Other 62 — Total deferred tax assets 1,891 1,796 Valuation allowance ( 214 ) ( 105 ) Total net deferred tax assets 1,677 1,691 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment ( 935 ) ( 800 ) Merchandise inventories ( 216 ) ( 228 ) Operating lease right-of-use assets ( 744 ) ( 801 ) Foreign branch deferreds ( 92 ) ( 81 ) Other — ( 40 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 1,987 ) ( 1,950 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 310 ) $ ( 259 ) The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2021 and 2020 include deferred income tax assets of $ 444 and $ 406 , respectively, included in other long-term assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $ 754 and $ 665 , respectively, included in other long-term liabilities. In 2021 and 2020, the Company had valuation allowances of $ 214 and $ 105 , respectively, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carry forwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030. The Company no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries after 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested (other than China) and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The Company continues to consider undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $ 3,070 , to be indefinitely reinvested and has not provided for withholding or state taxes. 58 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2021 and 2020 is as follows: 2021 2020 Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 30 $ 27 Gross increases—current year tax positions 2 1 Gross increases—tax positions in prior years 2 8 Gross decreases—tax positions in prior years — ( 3 ) Lapse of statute of limitations ( 1 ) ( 3 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 33 $ 30 The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2021 and 2020, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods is $ 30 and $ 28 at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties recognized during 2021 and 2020, and accrued at the end of each respective period were not material. The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12 months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2017. The Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present. Other Taxes The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company reached an agreement on a product tax audit resulting in a benefit of $ 84 . The Company recorded a charge of $ 123 in 2019 regarding this matter. Other possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these examinations are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 59 Table of Contents Note 10—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of basic and of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000’s): 2021 2020 2019 Net income attributable to Costco $ 5,007 $ 4,002 $ 3,659 Weighted average basic shares 443,089 442,297 439,755 RSUs 1,257 1,604 3,168 Weighted average diluted shares 444,346 443,901 442,923 Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigations arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in an action commenced in August 2013 under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to employees who work at entrance and exit doors in California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. ( Case No. 2013-1-CV-248813; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint.

Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. CIVDS 1908816; San Bernardino Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In October 2019, the parties reached an agreement to settle for an immaterial amount the seating claims on a representative basis, which received court approval in February 2020. The workplace temperature claims continue in litigation. 60 Table of Contents In January 2019, a former seasonal employee filed a class action, alleging failure to provide California seasonal employees meal and rest breaks, proper wage statements, and appropriate wages. Jadan v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-CV-340438; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees.

Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-03454; C.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2019, the court issued an order denying class certification. In January 2020, the plaintiffs dismissed their Labor Code claims without prejudice, and the court remanded the action to state court. The remand was appealed; the appeal is in abeyance due to a pending settlement for an immaterial amount that was agreed upon in February 2021. The preliminary approval hearing of the settlement is scheduled for October 2021. In May 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 2:19-cv-01340; E.D. Cal.). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees.

In August 2019, the plaintiff filed a companion case in state court seeking penalties under PAGA. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. FCS053454; Sonoma County Superior Court). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The state court action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal action. In June 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods, itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Martinez v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 3:19-cv-05624-EMC; N.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In June 2021, the plaintiff agreed to dismiss his claims for failure to provide meal and rest breaks and to pay minimum wages. In July 2021, the parties reached an agreement settling for an immaterial amount the remaining claim and related derivative claims. In April 2020, an employee, alleging underpayment of sick pay, filed a class and representative action against the Company, alleging claims under California law for failure to pay all wages at termination and for Labor Code penalties under PAGA. Kristy v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 5:20-cv-04119; N.D. Cal.). The case was stayed due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy, and his individual claim was settled for an immaterial amount. A request for dismissal of the class and representative action is pending. In July 2020, an employee filed an action under PAGA on behalf of all California non-exempt employees alleging violations of California Labor Code provisions regarding meal and rest periods, minimum wage, overtime, wage statements, reimbursement of expenses, and payment of wages at termination. Schwab v. Costco Wholesale Corporation (Case No. 37-2020-00023551-CU-OE-CTL; San Diego County Superior Court).

(Case No. 2:21-cv-4814; E.D.N.Y.). The Company has not yet responded to the complaint. In February 2021, a former employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, reimbursement of expenses, payment of final wages to terminated employees, and for unfair business practices. Edwards v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 5:21-cv-00716: C.D. Cal.). In May 2021, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted with leave to amend. In June 2021, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which the Company moved to dismiss later that month. The court granted the motion in part in July 2021 with leave to amend. In August 2021, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint and filed a separate representative action under PAGA asserting the same Labor Code claims and seeking civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The Company has filed an answer to the second amended class action complaint denying the material allegations. In July 2021, a former temporary staffing employee filed a class action against the Company and a staffing company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, the timeliness of wages and final wages, and for unfair business practices. Dimas v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. STK-CV-UOE-2021-0006024; San Joaquin Superior Court). The Company has not yet responded to the complaint. Beginning in December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio).

The complaints alleged violations of the federal securities laws stemming from the Company’s disclosures concerning internal control over financial reporting. A consolidated amended complaint was filed on April 16, 2019. On November 26, 2019, the court entered an order dismissing the consolidated amended complaint and granting the plaintiffs leave to file a further amended complaint. A further amended complaint was filed on March 9, which the court dismissed with prejudice on August 19, 2020. On July 20, 2021, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal. 62 Table of Contents Members of the Board of Directors, one other individual, and the Company were defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to the internal controls and related disclosures identified in the putative class actions, alleging that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties.

On June 23, 2020, a putative class action was filed against the Company, the “Board of Directors,” the “Costco Benefits Committee” and others under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Dustin S. Soulek v. Costco Wholesale, et al. , Case No. 1:20-cv-937. The class is alleged to be beneficiaries of the Costco 401(k) plan from June 23, 2014, and the claims are that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in the operation and oversight of the plan. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, damages, interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. On September 11, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and on September 21 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which the defendants have also moved to dismiss. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 63 Table of Contents Note 12—Segment Reporting The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Japan, U.K., Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France, and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1 . Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally come under the responsibility of U.S. management.

Item 9A—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 29, 2021 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 29, 2021, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 29, 2021. The attestation of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is included with the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 65 Table of Contents Item 9B—Other Information None.

PART I Item 1—Business Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, France, Iceland, China, and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Costco operated 795, 782, and 762 warehouses worldwide at August 30, 2020, September 1, 2019, and September 2, 2018, respectively. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol “COST.” We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2020, 2019, and 2018 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 30, 2020, September 1, 2019, and September 2, 2018, respectively. General We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts. We buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. 3 Table of Contents Our average warehouse space is approximately 146,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations. Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, co-brand cardholder rebates, executive member 2% reward certificates and our proprietary stored-value card (shop card). Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,700 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 8,000 to 10,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only. In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items. We offer merchandise in the following categories: • Food and Sundries (including dry foods, packaged foods, groceries, snack foods, candy, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and cleaning supplies) • Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, and garden and patio) • Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, deli, and bakery) • Softlines (including apparel and small appliances) • Ancillary (including gasoline and pharmacy businesses) Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services, encouraging members to shop more frequently. These businesses include gas stations, pharmacies, optical dispensing centers, food courts, and hearing-aid centers. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we do not currently operate our gasoline business in Korea or China. We operated 615 gas stations at the end of 2020. Net sales for our gasoline business represented approximately 9% of total net sales in 2020. Our e-commerce operations allow us to connect with our members online and provide additional products and services, many not found in our warehouses. Net sales for e-commerce represented approximately 6% of total net sales in 2020. This figure does not consider other services we offer online in certain countries such as business delivery, travel, same-day grocery, and various other services. We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented supply constraints including disruptions and delays that have impacted and could continue to impact the flow and availability of certain products. When sources of supply become unavailable, we seek alternative sources. We also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our members is significant. 4 Table of Contents Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Membership Our members may utilize their memberships at our warehouses worldwide. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or comparable document. Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $60 in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies in other countries. All paid memberships include a free household card. Our member renewal rate was 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% on a worldwide basis at the end of 2020. The majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. At the end of 2020, we standardized our membership count methodology globally to be consistent with the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in the addition to the count of approximately 2.0 million total cardholders for 2020, of which 1.3 million were paid members. The change did not impact 2019 or 2018. Membership fee income and the renewal rate calculations were not affected. Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands): 2020 2019 2018 Gold Star 46,800 42,900 40,700 Business, including affiliates 11,300 11,000 10,900 Total paid members 58,100 53,900 51,600 Household cards 47,400 44,600 42,700 Total cardholders 105,500 98,500 94,300 Paid cardholders (except affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S. and Canada, for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive memberships are also available in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, for which the additional annual fee varies. Executive members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. This program also offers (except in Mexico, Japan, and Korea), access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing. These services are generally provided by third parties and vary by state and country. Executive members, who totaled 22.6 million and represented 39% of paid members at the end of 2020, generally shop more frequently and spend more than other members. Labor Our employee count was as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Full-time employees 156,000 149,000 143,000 Part-time employees 117,000 105,000 102,000 Total employees 273,000 254,000 245,000 Approximately 17,100 employees are union employees. We consider our employee relations to be very good. 5 Table of Contents Competition Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution strategy, and customer service. We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with other warehouse clubs (primarily Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club), and many of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple clubs. Intellectual Property We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale ® trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland Signature ® . We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered at prices that are generally lower than national brands, and help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private-label items. We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained. Available Information Our U.S. website is www.costco.com. We make available through the Investor Relations section of that site, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such materials with or furnishing such documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC maintains a site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, such as the Company, that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. We have adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Copies of the code are available free of charge by writing to Secretary, Costco Wholesale Corporation, 999 Lake Drive, Issaquah, WA 98027.

We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management ' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Business and Operating Risks We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations. Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 87% and 83% of net sales and operating income in 2020, respectively. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 29% of U.S. net sales in 2020. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among other things: slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products. We may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets, and integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability. We seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance, member traffic, and profitability. We intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. We cannot ensure that new warehouses and new e-commerce websites will be profitable and, as a result, future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected. 8 Table of Contents We have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of our supply chains. The effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than opening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return. Our failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations. Membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations. We sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected. Disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction. We depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. We also rely upon processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics or other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. Our e-commerce business depends heavily on third-party logistics providers and that business is negatively affected when these providers are unable to provide services in a timely fashion. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns, or we may experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both of which would reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income. Availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital for our business to operate efficiently. Failure to execute complex IT projects, and have these IT systems available to our business will adversely impact our operations. IT systems play a crucial role in conducting our business on a daily basis. These systems are utilized to process a very high volume of transactions, conduct payment transactions, track and value our inventory and produce reports which are critical for making business decisions on a daily, weekly and periodic basis. Failure or disruption of these IT systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buy products from our suppliers, produce goods in our manufacturing plants, move the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to our members. We are undertaking large technology and IT transformation projects. The failure of these projects could adversely impact our business plans and 9 Table of Contents potentially impair our day to day business operations. Given the high volume of transactions we process, it is important that we build strong digital resiliency for our business-critical systems to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, errors by employees, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes. Any debilitating failure of our critical IT systems, data centers and backup systems would require significant investments in resources to restore IT services and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of business services, increased cost of moving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members. We are currently making significant investments in enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or delay in execution of these projects could delay our ability to be resilient to disruptive events. Failure to deliver our IT transformation efforts efficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst evolving threat landscapes and in compliance with emerging privacy and data protection regulations globally. Failure to meet the requirements could damage our reputation with members, suppliers and employees, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation. Increased IT security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. We rely upon IT systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities. Additionally, we collect, store and process sensitive information relating to our business, members, suppliers and employees. Operating these IT systems and networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. The increased use of remote work infrastructure due to the COVID-19 pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Security threats designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data, are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crimes and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. It is possible that our IT systems and networks, or those managed by third parties such as cloud providers, could have vulnerabilities, which could go unnoticed for a period of time. While our cybersecurity and compliance posture seeks to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we and our third-party service providers have implemented and are implementing, will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property. The potential impacts of a future material cybersecurity attack includes reputational damage, litigation, government enforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in IT systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. This could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition and loss of member confidence. Further, the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack. In addition, data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, China cybersecurity law and other emerging privacy and cybersecurity laws across the various states and around the globe, which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance. We are subject to payment-related risks. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including select credit and debit cards, cash and checks, co-brand cardholder rebates, executive member 2% reward certificates, and our shop card. As we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to 10 Table of Contents provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could disrupt our business if these parties become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. We might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputation, and expose us to litigation. If our merchandise, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children ' s products, pet products and durable goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members ' expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of illness or injury to our members. Such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or faulty design. Our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause illness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image, and these effects could be long-term. If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media, particularly in the wake of COVID-19. We are making investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Inability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends on the continued contributions of our employees, including members of our senior management and other key operations, IT, merchandising and administrative personnel. Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for senior management could negatively impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 11 Table of Contents We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance. Claims for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations. Market and Other External Risks We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors may have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets and customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results. General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Higher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreign-currency exchange rates, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal and tax policies including changes in tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, pandemics and other health crises, and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have raised the cost of many items and created uncertainty with respect to tariff impacts on the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our financial results. Prices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and 12 Table of Contents our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by events like the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism. Suppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins. We depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions causing a loss of sales and profits. We buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new suppliers, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available. Our suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies, supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, legal, regulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. During 2020, our international operations, including Canada, generated 27% and 33% of our net sales and operating income, respectively. Our international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. Future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our Canadian and Other International operations and have a corresponding adverse period-over-period effect on our results of operations. As we continue to expand internationally, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase. A portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold. Currency fluctuations may increase our cost of goods and may not be passed on to members. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. Natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, typhoons, floods, earthquakes; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; public health issues, including pandemics and quarantines, particularly in California or Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our properties, limitations on store operating hours, less frequent visits by members to physical locations, the temporary closure of warehouses, 13 Table of Contents depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, disruptions to our IT systems, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or members, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations in many respects. The continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile, and are affecting certain business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and on our employees, members, suppliers and other people and entities with which we do business. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business and government shutdowns. We are taking precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including temporarily requiring some employees to work remotely. To reward our employees for exemplary service in difficult times we temporarily increased compensation levels and otherwise incurred increased spending for wages and benefits, including overtime pay. The pandemic and any preventative or protective actions that governments or we may take are likely to result in a period of business disruption, reduced member traffic and reduced sales in certain merchandise categories, and increased operating expenses. The pandemic has significantly impacted the global supply chain, with restrictions and limitations on business activities causing disruption and delay. These disruptions and delays have strained certain domestic and international supply chains, which have affected and could continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain products. Member demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed and member behaviors have changed, which has challenged our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. These factors have resulted in higher out-of-stock positions in certain products, as well as delays in delivering those products. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more or require us to incur higher transportation costs, adversely impacting our profitability and financial condition. Similarly, increased demand for online purchases of products has impacted our fulfillment operations, resulting in delays in delivering products to members. If we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if our members do not participate in social distancing and other safety measures, the well-being of our employees and members could be at risk, and a failure to appropriately respond, or the perception of an inadequate response, could cause reputational harm to our brand and subject us to lost sales and claims from employees, members, suppliers, regulators or other parties. Additionally, a future outbreak of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our facilities could result in temporary or sustained workforce shortages or facility closures, which would negatively impact our business and results of operations. Some jurisdictions have taken measures intended to expand the availability of workers compensation or to change the presumptions applicable to workers compensation measures. These actions may increase our exposure to claims and increase our costs. 14 Table of Contents In an effort to strengthen our liquidity position, during the year we issued $4,000 million Senior Notes, a portion of which was used to repay, prior to maturity, $1,500 million of our 2.150% and 2.250% Senior Notes. Financial and credit markets have experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility and turmoil. Our continued access to external sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. If the impacts of the pandemic continue to disrupt the financial markets, or if rating agencies lower our credit ratings, it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt or other sources of external liquidity, if needed. Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: • The severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there is a “second wave” caused by additional periods of increases or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we operate; • Evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; • Unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response; • The pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides; and • The long-term impact of the pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors. To the extent that COVID-19 continues to adversely affect the U.S. and global economy, our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, brand reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, operational risk as a result of remote work arrangements and regulatory requirements. Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business. We use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. Government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. Climate change, extreme weather conditions, and rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which face increased regulation. Failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. We believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new member sign-ups, gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the market price of our stock to decline. Legal and Regulatory Risks We are subject to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. At the end of 2020, we operated 243 warehouses outside of the U.S., and we plan to continue expanding our international operations. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which are beyond our control. 15 Table of Contents These factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, policy changes such as the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions), monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. We are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. Accounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We could be subject to additional tax liabilities. We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at any point in time, we may be under examination for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may recognize additional tax expense, be subject to additional tax liabilities, or incur losses and penalties, due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Significant changes in or failure to comply with regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to a wide and increasingly broad array of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with these laws could result in harm to our members, employees or others, significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 16 Table of Contents Operations at our facilities require the treatment and disposal of wastewater, stormwater and agricultural and food processing wastes, the use and maintenance of refrigeration systems, including ammonia-based chillers, noise, odor and dust management, the operation of mechanized processing equipment, and other operations that potentially could affect the environment and public health and safety. Failure to comply with current and future environmental, health and safety standards could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, illness or injury of our employees, and claims or lawsuits related to such illnesses or injuries, and temporary closures or limits on the operations of facilities. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines, penalties, and remediation costs. We are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed property laws, and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these proceedings, audits, unclaimed property laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management ' s attention and resources. Item 1B—Unresolved Staff Comments None.

(5) Counts are included in total paid members 20 Table of Contents Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data) Overview We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary and other businesses. We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions (primarily impacting our U.S. and Canadian operations). The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to 21 Table of Contents continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse business. The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, and may lack an e-commerce business. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2020, 2019, and 2018 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 30, 2020, September 1, 2019, and September 2, 2018, respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2019 compared to 2018 refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2019 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on October 11, 2019. 22 Table of Contents Highlights for 2020 included: • We opened 16 new warehouses, including 3 relocations: 9 new in the U.S., 3 new in our Other International segment, and 1 net new location in our Canadian segment, compared to 25 new warehouses, including 5 relocations in 2019; • Net sales increased 9% to $163,220 driven by a 8% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2019 and 2020; • Membership fee revenue increased 6% to $3,541, primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses; • Gross margin percentage increased 18 basis points, driven primarily by certain core merchandise categories, partially offset by certain ancillary and other businesses, which were negatively impacted by COVID-19 related closures or restrictions; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased three basis points primarily due to leveraging increased sales and partial reversal of a previous year tax assessment. These benefits were partially offset by incremental wage and sanitation costs as a result of COVID-19; • The effective tax rate in 2020 was 24.4% compared to 22.3% in 2019; • Net income increased 9% to $4,002, or $9.02 per diluted share compared to $3,659, or $8.26 per diluted share in 2019; • In February 2020, we acquired a 35% interest in Navitus Health Solutions, a pharmacy benefit manager. In March 2020, we acquired Innovel Solutions, a company that provides final-mile delivery, installation and white-glove capabilities for big and bulky products across the United States and Puerto Rico; • In April 2020, we issued $4,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, some proceeds of which were used to repay $1,500 of Senior Notes; and • In April 2020, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.65 to $0.70 per share. COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that COVID-19 infections had become a pandemic, and shortly afterward the U.S. declared a National Emergency. The outbreak has led to widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and is affecting many aspects of our business and the operations of others with which we do business. In our response to the pandemic and in an effort to protect our members and employees, we have taken several measures, as described in Item 1A Risk Factors, and their implications on our results of operations have impacted us across all our reportable segments to varying degrees. Throughout the pandemic our warehouses have largely remained open as a result of being deemed an “essential business” in most markets and resulted in strong sales increases in our food and sundries and fresh foods merchandise categories compared to pre-pandemic time periods. This growth in certain of our core business categories has led to improved gross margin and SG&A percentages as we leveraged these sales to achieve greater efficiency. Our e-commerce business has also benefited, as more members have shopped online during the pandemic. Conversely, we have experienced decreases in both the sales and profitability of many of our ancillary and other businesses due to temporary closures or limited demand. Additionally, we paid $564 in incremental wage and sanitation costs during 2020 related to COVID-19. 23 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 2020 2019 2018 Net Sales $ 163,220 $ 149,351 $ 138,434 Changes in net sales: U.S. 9 % 9 % 9 % Canada 5 % 3 % 10 % Other International 13 % 5 % 14 % Total Company 9 % 8 % 10 % Changes in comparable sales: U.S. 8 % 8 % 9 % Canada 5 % 2 % 9 % Other International 9 % 2 % 11 % Total Company 8 % 6 % 9 % Increases in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency and gasoline prices (1) : U.S. 9 % 6 % 7 % Canada 7 % 5 % 4 % Other International 11 % 6 % 7 % Total Company 9 % 6 % 7 % _______________ (1) Excluding the impact of the revenue recognition standard for the year ended September 1, 2019. Net Sales Net sales increased $13,869 or 9% during 2020, primarily due to an 8% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2019 and 2020. During the second half of 2020, we experienced a significant sales shift from certain of our ancillary and other businesses to our core merchandise categories, primarily food and sundries and fresh foods, as a result of COVID-19. This shift was largely driven by price deflation and lower volume in our gasoline business; temporary closures of most of our optical, hearing aid and photo departments; limited service in our food courts; and minimal demand in our travel business. Changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $1,504, or 101 basis points, compared to 2019, due to a 10% decrease in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold decreased approximately 4%, negatively impacting net sales by $699, or 47 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $663, or 44 basis points, compared to 2019, attributable to our Canadian and Other International Operations. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 8% during 2020 and were positively impacted by increases in average ticket. While traffic increased slightly in 2020, it decreased in the second half of the year due to capacity restrictions and regulations related to COVID-19. There was an increase of 50% in e-commerce comparable sales in 2020, with an increase of 80% in the second half of the year. 24 Table of Contents Membership Fees 2020 2019 2018 Membership fees $ 3,541 $ 3,352 $ 3,142 Membership fees increase 6 % 7 % 10 % Membership fees as a percentage of net sales 2.17 % 2.24 % 2.27 % The increase in membership fees was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses. At the end of 2020, our member renewal rates were 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. Gross Margin 2020 2019 2018 Net sales $ 163,220 $ 149,351 $ 138,434 Less merchandise costs 144,939 132,886 123,152 Gross margin $ 18,281 $ 16,465 $ 15,282 Gross margin percentage 11.20 % 11.02 % 11.04 % The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 16 basis points, primarily due to increases in fresh foods and softlines, partially offset by a decrease in hardlines. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Fresh foods gross margin increased as a result of efficiencies from increased sales, partially offset by operating losses from our poultry complex. Total gross margin percentage increased 18 basis points compared to 2019. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 11.10%, an increase of eight basis points. This increase was primarily due to a 32 basis point increase in our core merchandise categories, predominantly fresh foods and food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease in softlines and hardlines. This increase was also positively impacted by our co-branded credit card program, which included an adjustment in 2019 to our estimate of breakage on rewards earned. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 14 basis points in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly certain ancillary businesses that were negatively impacted by COVID-19 related closures or restrictions. However, certain of our ancillary and other businesses, such as tire shop, gasoline and e-commerce businesses, did improve. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by incremental wage and sanitation costs related to COVID-19 of six basis points, a reserve for certain inventory of three basis points, and increased spending by members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program of one basis point. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $68 in 2020. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), was impacted by increases in fresh foods and food and sundries and decreases in softlines and hardlines in each of our U.S., Canadian, and Other International segments. Each of our segments were also negatively impacted by the incremental wage and sanitation costs as a result of COVID-19. The segment gross margin percentage increased in our U.S. operations, predominantly in our core merchandise categories which includes the impact from our co-branded credit card program, as discussed above, 25 Table of Contents partially offset by certain ancillary businesses that were negatively impacted by COVID-19 related closures or restrictions. Our Canadian segment gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to certain of our warehouse ancillary and other businesses that were negatively impacted by COVID-19 related closures or restrictions. The segment gross margin percentage increased in our Other International operations primarily due to core merchandise categories, as discussed above, and was also positively impacted by certain warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce. These increases were partially offset by increased spending by members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2020 2019 2018 SG&A expenses $ 16,332 $ 14,994 $ 13,876 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 10.01 % 10.04 % 10.02 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased three basis points compared to 2019. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation, was 9.91%, a decrease of 13 basis points. SG&A expenses were negatively impacted by approximately $456, or 28 basis points, due to incremental wage and sanitation costs as a result of COVID-19, and approximately $24 or one basis point due to costs associated with the acquisition of Innovel (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Operating costs related to warehouse operations and other businesses, which include e-commerce and travel, were lower by 26 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales. SG&A expenses were also benefited by 13 basis points related to a product tax assessment charge in 2019 which was partially reversed in 2020. Stock compensation was lower by two basis points, and central operating costs were lower by one basis point. Our Canadian segment SG&A percentage was higher compared to 2019 due primarily to the incremental wage and sanitation costs related to COVID as outlined above. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted SG&A expenses by approximately $58. Preopening 2020 2019 2018 Preopening expenses $ 55 $ 86 $ 68 Warehouse openings, including relocations United States 9 18 17 Canada 4 3 3 Other International 3 4 5 Total warehouse openings, including relocations 16 25 25 Preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse and facility openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year-end, whether a warehouse is owned or leased, and whether openings are in an existing, new, or international market. In 2020, operations commenced at our new poultry processing plant, and in 2019, we opened our first warehouse in China. Interest Expense 2020 2019 2018 Interest expense $ 160 $ 150 $ 159 Interest expense primarily relates to Senior Notes. In December 2019 and February 2020, we repaid $1,200 and $500 in total outstanding principal of the 1.700% and 1.750% Senior Notes, respectively. In 26 Table of Contents April 2020, we issued $4,000 in aggregate principal amount of long-term debt consisting of $ 1,250 of 1.375 % Senior Notes due June 2027; $ 1,750 of 1.600 % Senior Notes due April 2030; and $ 1,000 of 1.750 % Senior Notes due April 2032. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay, prior to maturity, $1,000 and $500 of the 2.150% and 2.250% Senior Notes. For more information on our debt arrangements refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest Income and Other, Net 2020 2019 2018 Interest income $ 89 $ 126 $ 75 Foreign-currency transaction gains, net 7 27 23 Other, net (4) 25 23 Interest income and other, net $ 92 $ 178 $ 121 The decrease in interest income in 2020 was primarily due to lower interest rates in the U.S. and Canada, partially offset by higher average cash and investment balances. Foreign-currency transaction gains, net include the revaluation and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities and mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts by our Canadian and Other International operations. See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Other, net was impacted by a $36 charge related to the repayment of certain Senior Notes, as discussed above and in Note 5 . Provision for Income Taxes 2020 2019 2018 Provision for income taxes $ 1,308 $ 1,061 $ 1,263 Effective tax rate 24.4 % 22.3 % 28.4 % The effective tax rate for 2020 included discrete net tax benefits of $81, including a benefit of $77 due to excess tax benefits from stock compensation. Excluding these benefits, the tax rate was 25.9% for 2020. The effective tax rate for 2019 included discrete net tax benefits of $221, including a benefit of $59 due to excess tax benefits from stock compensation. This also included a tax benefit of $105 related to U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends, offset by losses of foreign tax credits, which impacted the effective tax rate. Excluding these benefits, the tax rate was 26.9% for 2019. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 2020 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 8,861 $ 6,356 $ 5,774 Net cash used in investing activities (3,891) (2,865) (2,947) Net cash used in financing activities (1,147) (1,147) (1,281) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $13,305 and $9,444 at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $1,636 and $1,434 at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively. These receivables generally settle within four days. Cash and cash equivalents were positively impacted by a change in exchange rates of $70 in 2020, and negatively impacted by $15 and $37 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. 27 Table of Contents Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. We no longer consider earnings after 2017 of our non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $8,861 in 2020, compared to $6,356 in 2019. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, payment terms with our suppliers, and the amount of payables paid early to obtain discounts from our suppliers. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $3,891 in 2020, compared to $2,865 in 2019, and primarily related to capital expenditures. In 2020, we acquired Innovel and a minority interest in Navitus. For more information see Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Net cash flows from investing activities also includes maturities and purchases of short-term investments. Capital Expenditures Our primary requirement for capital is acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In 2020, we spent $2,810 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximat ely $3,000 to $3,200 d uring fiscal 2021. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 16 new warehous es, including three relocations, in 2020, and plan to open approximately 23 additional new warehouses, including three relocations, in 2021. We have experienced delays in real estate and construction activities due to COVID-19. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs or based on the current economic environment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,147 in both 2020 and 2019. In April 2020, we issued $4,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes as follows: $1,250 of 1.375% due June 2027; $1,750 of 1.600% due April 2030; and $1,000 of 1.750% due April 2032. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay, prior to maturity, the outstanding $1,000 and $500 principal balances on the 2.150% and 2.250% Senior Notes, respectively, at a redemption price plus accrued interest as specified in the Notes' agreements. The remaining funds are intended for general corporate purposes. Financing activities also included $1,200 and $500 repayment of our 1.700% and 1.750% Senior Notes, respectively, payment of dividends, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, and repurchases of common stock. Stock Repurchase Programs During 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 643,000 and 1,097,000 shares of common stock, at average prices of $308.45 and $225.16, respectively, totaling approximately $198 and $247, respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington 28 Table of Contents Business Corporation Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,745 at the end of 2020. Dividends Cash dividends declared in 2020 totaled $2.70 per share, as compared to $2.44 per share in 2019. Dividends totaling $1,479 were paid during 2020, of which $286 related to the dividend declared in August 2019. In April 2020, the Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.65 to $0.70 per share. In July 2020, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.70 per share, which was paid on August 14, 2020. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At August 30, 2020, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $967. Our international operations maintain $500 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $204 is guaranteed by the Company. There were no outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2020 and 2019. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $183. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2020 totaled $166, most of which were standby letters of credit which do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. Contractual Obligations At August 30, 2020, our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2021 2022 to 2023 2024 to 2025 2026 and thereafter Total Purchase obligations (1) $ 12,575 $ 9 $ — $ — $ 12,584 Long-term debt (2) 241 1,163 1,475 5,776 8,655 Operating leases (3) (4) 273 499 388 2,410 3,570 Construction and land obligations 979 35 — — 1,014 Finance lease obligations (4) 61 128 197 742 1,128 Purchase obligations (equipment, services and other) (5) 674 205 72 187 1,138 Other (6) 60 36 28 108 232 Total $ 14,863 $ 2,075 $ 2,160 $ 9,223 $ 28,321 _______________ (1) Includes open purchase orders primarily related to merchandise and supplies. (2) Includes contractual interest payments and excludes deferred issuance costs. (3) Operating lease payments have not been reduced by future sublease income of $101. (4) Includes amounts representing interest. (5) Excludes certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (6) Includes asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. The amount excludes $25 of non-current unrecognized tax contingencies and $48 of other obligations due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. 29 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities Claims for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to seek to limit exposures arising from very large losses. We use different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, and participate in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims over time. While we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions) Our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents, as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short-term investments are in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. 30 Table of Contents Our policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, U.S. government and government agency money market funds, and insured bank balances. Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers’ acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies. A 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2020 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value. For those investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. The nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of 2020, long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $7,657. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt. Foreign Currency Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to the Company's forward foreign-exchange contracts, see Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2020, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $111 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to some of the fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment. 31 Table of Contents Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Costco Wholesale Corporation: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 30, 2020 and September 1, 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 52-week periods ended August 30, 2020, September 1, 2019 and September 2, 2018, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 30, 2020 and September 1, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the 52-week periods ended August 30, 2020, September 1, 2019 and September 2, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of August 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated October 6, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of September 2, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 – Leases (ASC 842). Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 32 Table of Contents Evaluation of self-insurance liabilities As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated insurance/self-insurance liabilities as of August 30, 2020 were $1,188 million, a portion of which related to workers’ compensation and general liability self-insurance liabilities for the United States and Canadian operations. We identified the evaluation of the Company’s workers’ compensation and general liability self-insurance liabilities for the United States and Canadian operations as a critical audit matter because of the extent of specialized skill and knowledge needed to evaluate the Company’s actuarial models and the judgments required to assess the underlying assumptions made by the Company. Specifically, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate certain assumptions underlying the Company’s actuarial estimates, including reporting and payment patterns used in the projections of the ultimate loss; loss and exposure trends; the selected loss rates and initial expected losses used in the Paid and Incurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods; and the selection of the ultimate loss derived from the various methods. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s self-insurance process. This included controls related to the development and selection of the assumptions listed above used in the actuarial calculation and review of the actuarial report. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in: • Assessing the actuarial models used by the Company for consistency with generally accepted actuarial standards • Evaluating the Company’s ability to estimate self-insurance liabilities by comparing its historical estimate with actual incurred losses and paid losses • Evaluating the above listed assumptions underlying the Company’s actuarial estimates by developing an independent expectation of the self-insurance liabilities and comparing them to the amounts recorded by the Company /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002. Seattle, Washington October 6, 2020 33 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Costco Wholesale Corporation: Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries ’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of August 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of August 30, 2020 and September 1, 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 52-week periods ended August 30, 2020, September 1, 2019 and September 2, 2018, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated October 6, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Seattle, Washington October 6, 2020 34 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (amounts in

and warehouse count data) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At August 30, 2020, Costco operated 795 warehouses worldwide: 552 in the United States (U.S.) located in 45 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 101 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 27 in Japan, 16 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, 12 in Australia, three in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France and China. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. In February 2020, the Company acquired a 35 % interest in Navitus Health Solutions, a pharmacy benefit manager. This investment is included in other long-term assets and is accounted for using the equity-method with earnings/losses recorded in other income in the consolidated statement of income. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2020, 2019, and 2018 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 30, 2020, September 1, 2019, and September 2, 2018, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public and private sector policies and initiatives. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to four days. Credit and debit card receivables were $ 1,636 and $ 1,434 at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively. 40 Table of Contents The Company provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as payments are presented. Included in accounts payable at the end of 2020 and 2019 are $ 810 and $ 673 , respectively, representing the excess of outstanding payments over cash on deposit at the banks on which the payments were drawn. Short-Term Investments Short-term investments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. Government and Agency Notes), with maturities at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Short-term investments classified as held-to-maturity are financial instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis. The Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment, using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company recognizes the loss in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 3 , 4 , and 5 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all other non-derivative financial instruments are based on independent external valuation information. The pricing process uses data from a variety of independent external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves including but not limited to treasury benchmarks and Libor and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable, using the fair value of the individual securities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred. 41 Table of Contents Current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities include the Company's long-term debt, which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs, and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt is based primarily on reported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon interest rates, maturities, and credit. Receivables, Net Receivables consist primarily of vendor, reinsurance, credit card incentive, third-party pharmacy and other receivables. Vendor receivables include discounts and volume rebates. Balances are generally presented on a gross basis, separate from any related payable due. In certain circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor, in which case the receivables are presented on a net basis. Reinsurance receivables are held by the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and primarily represent amounts ceded through reinsurance arrangements gross of the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Credit card incentive receivables primarily represent amounts earned under the co-branded credit card arrangement in the U.S. Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members’ insurers. Other receivables primarily consist of amounts due from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items. Receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on historical experience and application of the specific identification method. Write-offs of receivables were immaterial in 2020, 2019, and 2018. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories consist of the following: 2020 2019 United States $ 8,871 $ 8,415 Canada 1,310 1,123 Other International 2,061 1,857 Merchandise inventories $ 12,242 $ 11,395 Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and inventory levels have been determined. As of August 30, 2020, and September 1, 2019, U.S. merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated first-in, first-out (FIFO) after considering the lower of cost or market principle. Canadian and Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly valued using the cost and retail inventory methods, respectively, using the FIFO basis. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts using estimates based on experience. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates, provided that they are probable and reasonably estimable. 42 Table of Contents Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization expense is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements made after the beginning of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease plus any renewals that are reasonably certain at the date the leasehold improvements are made. The Company capitalizes certain computer software and costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. During development, these costs are included in construction in progress. When the assets are ready for their intended use, these costs are included in equipment and fixtures and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or change the way an asset functions or that extend the useful life are capitalized. Assets removed during the remodel, refurbishment or improvement are retired. Assets classified as held-for-sale at the end of 2020 and 2019 were immaterial. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances at the end of 2020 and 2019: Estimated Useful Lives 2020 2019 Land N/A $ 6,696 $ 6,417 Buildings and improvements 5-50 years 17,982 17,136 Equipment and fixtures 3-20 years 8,749 7,801 Construction in progress N/A 1,276 1,272 34,703 32,626 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 12,896 ) ( 11,736 ) Property and equipment, net $ 21,807 $ 20,890 The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in circumstances may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For asset groups held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In the event that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal to the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale (disposal group), the carrying value is compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisals from third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. There were no impairment charges recognized in 2020, 2019 or 2018. Leases The Company leases land and/or buildings at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities. Leases generally contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair market value; or (c) a right of first refusal in the event of a third-party offer. 43 Table of Contents Some leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. Impairment of ROU assets is evaluated in a similar manner as described in Property and Equipment, Net above. The Company's asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that at the end of a lease must be removed. These obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability, with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term based upon the estimated fair value of the costs to remove the improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same depreciation method as the leasehold improvement assets and are included with buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associated with these leases are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results. Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable segment: United States Operations Canadian Operations Other International Operations Total Balance at September 1, 2019 $ 13 $ 27 $ 13 $ 53 Changes in currency translation — — 1 1 Acquisition 934 — — 934 Balance at August 30, 2020 $ 947 $ 27 $ 14 $ 988 Definite-lived intangible assets, which are not material, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit. 44 Table of Contents Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities Claims for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit exposures arising from very large losses. It uses different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive) and participates in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of 2020 and 2019, these insurance liabilities were $ 1,188 and $ 1,222 in the aggregate, respectively, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature. The captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes other third-party participants. The reinsurance agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement of the next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program limit a participating members’ individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior activity. Derivatives The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts relate primarily to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding contracts upon certain triggering events. The aggregate fair value amounts of derivative instruments in a net liability position and the amount needed to settle the instruments immediately if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered were immaterial at the end of 2020 and 2019. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were $ 1,036 and $ 704 at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 4 for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2020 and 2019. The unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodity products used in retail and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment. 45 Table of Contents Foreign Currency The functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Revenues and expenses of the Company’s consolidated foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. The Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Generally, these include the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries revalued to their functional currency. Also included are realized foreign-currency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items were immaterial in 2020, 2019, and 2018. Revenue Recognition The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09 in 2019, which provided for changes in the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and member returns. The Company reserves for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods. The Company also provides expanded products and services through warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The majority of revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally is established when Costco is primarily responsible for merchandising decisions, maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member service and satisfaction, and has pricing discretion. The Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. Deferred membership fees at the end of 2020 and 2019 were $ 1,851 and $ 1,711 , respectively. In most countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum of approximately $1,000 per year), which does not expire and can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2020, 2019 and 2018, the net reduction in sales was $ 1,707 , $ 1,537 , and $ 1,394 respectively. 46 Table of Contents The Company sells and otherwise provides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for outstanding shop card balances as a shop card liability, net of estimated breakage. Citibank, N.A. (“Citi”) became the exclusive issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members in June 2016. The Company receives various forms of consideration, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco, a portion of which, after giving rise to estimated breakage, is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receive. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. Breakage is estimated based on redemption data. Merchandise Costs Merchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company’s depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses, and are reduced by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods and certain ancillary departments. Vendor Consideration The Company has agreements to receive funds from vendors for discounts and a variety of other programs. These programs are evidenced by signed agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebate or discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers’ compensation costs for warehouse employees (other than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses which are reflected in merchandise costs) as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, stock compensation expense, credit and debit card processing fees, utilities, as well as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse and e-commerce website operations. Retirement Plans The Company's 401(k) retirement plan is available to all U.S. employees over the age of 18 who have completed 90 days of employment. The plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. The Company also has a defined contribution plan for Canadian employees and contributes a percentage of each employee's wages. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations have defined benefit and defined contribution plans that are not material. Amounts expensed under all plans were $ 676 , $ 614 , and $ 578 for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and are predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Stock-Based Compensation RSUs granted to employees generally vest over five years and allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based awards that would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. Actual forfeitures are recognized as they occur. 47 Table of Contents Compensation expense for stock-based awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for the entire award. Awards for employees and non-employee directors provide for accelerated vesting based on cumulative years of service with the Company. Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long-service term. The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense is predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Certain stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 8 for additional information on the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses and are expensed as incurred. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized. The timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes as appropriate. Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco The computation of basic net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method for shares subject to RSUs. Stock Repurchase Programs Repurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and is applied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 7 for additional information. 48 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02 - Leases (ASC 842), which required recognition on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by leases with terms greater than 12 months. The Company adopted ASC 842, using the modified retrospective transition method and used September 2, 2019, as the date of initial application. Consequently, the comparative periods presented continue to be in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, previously in effect. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, allowing the Company to carry forward conclusions related to: (a) whether expired or existing contracts contain leases; (b) lease classification; and (c) initial direct costs for existing leases. The Company has elected not to record operating lease right-of-use assets or lease liabilities associated with leases with durations of 12 months or less. The Company elected the practical expedient allowing aggregation of non-lease components with related lease components when evaluating the accounting treatment for all classes of underlying assets. Adoption of the new standard resulted in an initial increase to assets and liabilities of $ 2,632 , related to recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease obligations as of September 2, 2019. Other impacts in the Company's consolidated balance sheet were not material. The standard did not materially impact the consolidated statements of income and cash flows. For more information on the Company's lease arrangements refer to Note 6 . Note 2—Acquisition of Innovel On March 17, 2020, the Company acquired Innovel Solutions for $ 998 , using existing cash and cash equivalents. Cash paid excludes the final settlement of certain holdbacks and provisional amounts, discussed below. As part of the acquisition, in the fourth quarter of 2020, a payment of $ 25 was made relating to certain holdbacks. Innovel provides final-mile delivery, installation and white-glove capabilities for big and bulky products across the United States and Puerto Rico. Its financial results have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Innovel's results of operations were not material to the Company's consolidated results during 2020. Pro forma results are thus not considered meaningful. As of August 30, 2020, the initial accounting for the acquisition was incomplete, pending determination of the final purchase price, working capital adjustments, the fair value of operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and other assumed obligations. The net purchase price of $ 998 was allocated to tangible and intangible assets of $ 283 and liabilities assumed of $ 219 , based on their preliminary fair values on the acquisition date. The remaining unallocated net purchase price of $ 934 was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the acquisition's benefits to the Company, which include the ability to serve more members and improve delivery times, enabling growth in certain segments of our U.S. e-commerce operations. The Company assigned this goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes, to reporting units within the U.S. segment. The changes to the purchase price allocation originally recorded in the third quarter of 2020 were not material. As additional information becomes available, the provisional fair value estimates will be refined. 49 Table of Contents Note 3—Investments The Company’s investments were as follows: 2020: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 436 $ 12 $ 448 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 580 — 580 Total short-term investments $ 1,016 $ 12 $ 1,028 2019: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 716 $ 6 $ 722 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 338 — 338 Total short-term investments $ 1,054 $ 6 $ 1,060 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the years ended August 30, 2020, and September 1, 2019. At the end of 2020, there were no available-for-sale securities in a continuous unrealized-loss position. At the end of 2019, available-for-sale securities that were in a continuous unrealized-loss position were not material. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during 2020 or 2019. The maturities of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities at the end of 2020 are as follows: Available-For-Sale Held-To-Maturity Cost Basis Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 172 $ 173 $ 580 Due after one year through five years 264 275 — Total $ 436 $ 448 $ 580 50 Table of Contents Note 4—Fair Value Measurement Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The table below presents information regarding the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the level within the hierarchy reflecting the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. Level 2 2020 2019 Investment in government and agency securities (1) $ 508 $ 766 Forward foreign-exchange contracts, in asset position (2) 1 15 Forward foreign-exchange contracts, in (liability) position (2) ( 21 ) ( 4 ) Total $ 488 $ 777 ____________ (1) At August 30, 2020, $ 60 cash and cash equivalents and $ 448 short-term investments are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At September 1, 2019, $ 44 cash and cash equivalents and $ 722 short-term investments are included in the consolidated balance sheets. (2) The asset and the liability values are included in other current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. At August 30, 2020, and September 1, 2019, the Company did not hold any Level 1 or 3 financial assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between levels during 2020 or 2019. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. There were no fair value adjustments to these items during 2020 or 2019. Note 5—Debt Short-Term Borrowings The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $ 967 and $ 865 , in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Borrowings on these short-term facilities were immaterial during 2020 and 2019, and there were no outstanding borrowings at the end of 2020 and 2019. Long-Term Debt The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100 % of the principal amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain events, the holder has the right to require the Company to purchase this security at a price of 101 % of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the event. Interest on all outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs. 51 Table of Contents In April 2020, the Company issued $4,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes as follows: $ 1,250 of 1.375 % due June 2027; $ 1,750 of 1.600 % due April 2030; and $ 1,000 of 1.750 % due April 2032. In May 2020, a portion of the proceeds from the issuance were used to repay, prior to maturity, the outstanding $ 1,000 and $ 500 principal balances and interest on the 2.150 % and 2.250 % Senior Notes, respectively. The early redemption resulted in a $36 charge which was recorded in interest income and other, net in 2020. The remaining funds are intended for general corporate purposes. In December 2019, the Company paid the outstanding $ 1,200 principal balance and interest on the 1.700 % Senior Notes, with existing sources of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. In February 2020, the Company paid the outstanding $ 500 principal balance and interest on the 1.750 % Senior Notes, with existing sources of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In August 2019, the Company's Japanese subsidiary issued approximately $ 200 and $ 100 of Guaranteed Senior Notes at fixed interest rates of 0.28 % and 0.42 %, respectively. Interest is payable semi-annually, and principal is due in August 2029 and August 2034, respectively. At the end of 2020 and 2019, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $ 7,987 and $ 6,997 , respectively. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following: 2020 2019 1.700% Senior Notes due December 2019 $ — $ 1,200 1.750% Senior Notes due February 2020 — 500 2.150% Senior Notes due May 2021 — 1,000 2.250% Senior Notes due February 2022 — 500 2.300% Senior Notes due May 2022 800 800 2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 1,000 1,000 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1,000 1,000 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1,250 — 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1,750 — 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 1,000 — Other long-term debt 857 852 Total long-term debt 7,657 6,852 Less unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 48 29 Less current portion (1) 95 1,699 Long-term debt, excluding current portion $ 7,514 $ 5,124 _______________ (1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.

The Company's current quarterly dividend rate is $ 0.70 per share. Stock Repurchase Programs The Company's stock repurchase program is conducted under a $ 4,000 authorization by the Board of Directors, which expires in April 2023. As of the end of 2020, the remaining amount available under the approved plan was $ 3,745 . The following table summarizes the Company’s stock repurchase activity: Shares Repurchased (000’s) Average Price per Share Total Cost 2020 643 $ 308.45 $ 198 2019 1,097 225.16 247 2018 1,756 183.13 322 These amounts may differ from repurchases of common stock in the consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Note 8—Stock-Based Compensation Plans The Company grants stock-based compensation, primarily to employees and non-employee directors. Grants to all executive officers are performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approvals, there have been amended and restated plans and new provisions implemented by the Company. RSUs are subject to quarterly vesting upon retirement or voluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25 years of service with the Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting date. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares ( 10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate of 27,800,000 shares ( 15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes. Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity RSUs granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over five and three years, respectively. Additionally, the terms of the RSUs, including performance-based awards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained 25 or more and five or more years of service with the Company, respectively. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and undelivered shares. At the end of 2020, 13,624,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs under the 2019 Incentive Plan. 55 Table of Contents The following awards were outstanding at the end of 2020: • 5,021,000 time-based RSUs that vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time; • 153,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 123,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of performance targets for 2020. This determination occurred in September 2020, at which time at least 33% of the units vested, as a result of the long service of all executive officers. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. The following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2020: Number of Units (in 000’s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at the end of 2019 6,496 $ 167.55 Granted 2,252 294.08 Vested and delivered ( 3,374 ) 188.92 Forfeited ( 200 ) 197.45 Outstanding at the end of 2020 5,174 $ 207.55 The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $ 294.08 , $ 224.00 , and $ 156.19 in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2020 was $ 697 and the weighted-average period of time over which this cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2020 were approximately 1,733,000 RSUs vested but not yet delivered. Summary of Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits under the Company’s plans: 2020 2019 2018 Stock-based compensation expense $ 619 $ 595 $ 544 Less recognized income tax benefit 128 128 116 Stock-based compensation expense, net $ 491 $ 467 $ 428 Note 9— Taxes Income Taxes Income before income taxes is comprised of the following: 2020 2019 2018 Domestic $ 4,204 $ 3,591 $ 3,182 Foreign 1,163 1,174 1,260 Total $ 5,367 $ 4,765 $ 4,442 56 Table of Contents The provisions for income taxes are as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Federal: Current $ 616 $ 328 $ 636 Deferred 77 222 ( 35 ) Total federal 693 550 601 State: Current 230 178 190 Deferred 8 26 22 Total state 238 204 212 Foreign: Current 372 405 487 Deferred 5 ( 98 ) ( 37 ) Total foreign 377 307 450 Total provision for income taxes $ 1,308 $ 1,061 $ 1,263 Except for certain provisions, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act) is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Company is a fiscal-year taxpayer, so most provisions became effective for fiscal 2019, including limitations on the Company’s ability to claim foreign tax credits, repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction, and limitations on certain business deductions. Provisions with significant impacts that were effective starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and throughout fiscal 2019 included: a decrease in the U.S. federal income tax rate, remeasurement of certain net deferred tax liabilities, and a transition tax on deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings. The decrease in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to 21.0 % was effective for all of 2020 and 2019 and resulted in a blended rate for the Company of 25.6 % for 2018. The reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2020, 2019, and 2018 is as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Federal taxes at statutory rate $ 1,127 21.0 % $ 1,001 21.0 % $ 1,136 25.6 % State taxes, net 190 3.6 171 3.6 154 3.4 Foreign taxes, net 92 1.7 ( 1 ) — 32 0.7 Employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) ( 24 ) ( 0.5 ) ( 18 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 14 ) ( 0.3 ) 2017 Tax Act — — ( 123 ) ( 2.6 ) 19 0.4 Other ( 77 ) ( 1.4 ) 31 0.7 ( 64 ) ( 1.4 ) Total $ 1,308 24.4 % $ 1,061 22.3 % $ 1,263 28.4 % During 2019, the Company recognized net tax benefits of $ 123 related to the 2017 Tax Act. This benefit primarily included $ 105 related to U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends, partially offset by losses of current year foreign tax credits. During 2018, the Company recognized a net tax expense of $ 19 related to the 2017 Tax Act. This expense included $ 142 for the estimated tax on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, and $ 43 for the reduction in foreign tax credits and other immaterial items, largely offset by a tax benefit of $ 166 for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities. 57 Table of Contents The Company recognized total net tax benefits of $ 81 , $ 221 and $ 57 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts include a benefit of $ 77 , $ 59 and $ 33 , respectively, related to the stock-based compensation accounting standard adopted in 2018 in addition to the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act noted above. The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows: 2020 2019 Deferred tax assets: Equity compensation $ 80 $ 74 Deferred income/membership fees 144 180 Foreign tax credit carry forward 101 65 Operating lease liabilities 832 — Accrued liabilities and reserves 639 566 Total deferred tax assets 1,796 885 Valuation allowance ( 105 ) ( 76 ) Total net deferred tax assets 1,691 809 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment ( 800 ) ( 677 ) Merchandise inventories ( 228 ) ( 187 ) Operating lease right-of-use assets ( 801 ) — Foreign branch deferreds ( 81 ) ( 69 ) Other ( 40 ) ( 21 ) Total deferred tax liabilities $ ( 1,950 ) $ ( 954 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 259 ) $ ( 145 ) The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2020 and 2019 include deferred income tax assets of $ 406 and $ 398 , respectively, included in other long-term assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $ 665 and $ 543 , respectively, included in other long-term liabilities. In 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded valuation allowances of $ 105 and $ 76 , respectively, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes will not be realized due to limitations on the ability to claim the credits during the carry forward period. The foreign tax credit carry forwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030. The Company no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries after 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign withholding (net of available foreign tax credits) on fiscal year earnings and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The Company continues to consider undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries prior to 2018, which totaled $ 2,955 , to be indefinitely reinvested and has not provided for withholding or state taxes. 58 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2020 and 2019 is as follows: 2020 2019 Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 27 $ 36 Gross increases—current year tax positions 1 5 Gross increases—tax positions in prior years 8 2 Gross decreases—tax positions in prior years ( 3 ) — Settlements — ( 4 ) Lapse of statute of limitations ( 3 ) ( 12 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 30 $ 27 The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2020 and 2019, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods is $ 28 and $ 24 at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties recognized during 2020 and 2019 and accrued at the end of each respective period were not material. The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and in several foreign countries. Some audits may conclude in the next 12 months and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2017. The Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present. Other Taxes The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Subsequent to the end of 2019, the Company received an assessment related to a product tax audit covering multiple years. The Company recorded a charge of $ 123 in 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company reached an agreement with the tax authority on this matter, resulting in a benefit of $84. Other possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 59 Table of Contents Note 10—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of basic and of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000’s): 2020 2019 2018 Net income attributable to Costco $ 4,002 $ 3,659 $ 3,134 Weighted average basic shares 442,297 439,755 438,515 RSUs 1,604 3,168 3,319 Weighted average diluted shares 443,901 442,923 441,834 Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in an action under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to member service assistants who act as greeters in the Company’s California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. ( Case No. 5:13-CV-03598; N.D. Cal.; filed July 1, 2013). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. The action has been remanded to state court. In January 2019, an employee brought similar claims for relief concerning Costco employees engaged at member services counters in California. Rodriguez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. RG19001310; Alameda Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that depot employees in California did not receive suitable seating or appropriate workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Dec. 6, 2018 Notice to California Labor and Workforce Development Agency). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In October 2019, the parties reached an agreement to settle the seating claims on a representative basis, which received court approval in February 2020. 60 Table of Contents In January 2019, a former seasonal employee filed a class action, alleging failure to provide California seasonal employees meal and rest breaks, proper wage statements, and appropriate wages. Jadan v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-CV-340438; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. In October 2019, the parties reached an agreement on a class settlement, which received preliminary court approval in July 2020. In March 2019, employees filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods and itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-03454; C.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2019, the court issued an order denying class certification. In January 2020, the plaintiffs dismissed their Labor Code claims without prejudice, and the court remanded the action to state court. The remand is being appealed. In May 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 2:19-cv-01340; E.D. Cal.). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. In August 2019, Rough filed a companion case in state court seeking penalties under PAGA. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. FCS053454; Sonoma County Superior Court). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The state court action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal action. In June 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods, itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Martinez v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 3:19-cv-05624; N.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In April 2020, an employee, alleging underpayment of sick pay, filed a class and representative action against the Company, alleging claims under California law for failure to pay all wages at termination and for Labor Code penalties under PAGA. Kristy v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 20CV366341; Santa Clara County Superior Court). A motion to dismiss was filed as to plaintiff's amended complaint, the case has been stayed due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy. In July 2020, an employee filed an action under PAGA on behalf of all California non-exempt employees alleging violations of California Labor Code provisions regarding meal and rest periods, minimum wage, overtime, wage statements, reimbursement of expenses, and payment of wages at termination. Schwab v. Costco Wholesale Corporation (Case No. 37-2020-00023551-CU-OE-CTL; San Diego County Superior Court). In August 2020, the Company filed a motion to strike portions of the complaint. In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are federal cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 43 states and American Samoa. In 2019, similar actions were commenced against the Company in state court in Utah. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of these matters. 61 Table of Contents The Company and its CEO and CFO are defendants in putative class actions brought on behalf of shareholders who acquired Company stock between June 6 and October 25, 2018. Johnson v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash.; filed Nov. 5, 2018); Chen v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash.; filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaints allege violations of the federal securities laws stemming from the Company’s disclosures concerning internal control over financial reporting. They seek unspecified damages, equitable relief, interest, and costs and attorneys’ fees. On January 30, 2019, an order was entered consolidating the actions, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on April 16, 2019. On November 26, 2019, the court entered an order dismissing the consolidated amended complaint and granting the plaintiffs leave to file a further amended complaint. A further amended complaint was filed on March 9, which the court dismissed with prejudice on August 19, 2020. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in September 2020. Members of the Board of Directors, one other individual, and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to the internal controls and related disclosures identified in the putative class actions, alleging that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties. Wedekind v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (W.D. Wash.; filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement of compensation, corporate governance changes, and costs and attorneys' fees. Because the complaint is derivative in nature, it does not seek monetary damages from the Company, which is a nominal defendant. By agreement among the parties the action has been stayed pending further proceedings in the class action. Similar actions were filed in King County Superior Court on February 20, 2019, Elliott v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-04824-7), April 16, 2019, Brad Shuman, et ano. v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-10460-1), and June 12, 2019, Rahul Modi v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-15514-1). These actions have also been stayed. On June 23, 2020, a putative class action was filed against the Company, the ""Board of Directors,"" the ""Costco Benefits Committee"" and others under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Dustin S. Soulek v. Costco Wholesale, et al. , Case No. 20-cv-937. The class is alleged to be beneficiaries of the Costco 401(k) plan from June 23, 2014, and the claims are that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in the operation and oversight of the plan. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, damages, interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. On September 11, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and on September 21 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 62 Table of Contents Note 12—Segment Reporting The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France, and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1 . Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally come under the responsibility of U.S. management. The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments: United States Operations Canadian Operations Other International Operations Total 2020 Total revenue $ 122,142 $ 22,434 $ 22,185 $ 166,761 Operating income 3,633 860 942 5,435 Depreciation and amortization 1,248 155 242 1,645 Additions to property and equipment 2,060 258 492 2,810 Property and equipment, net 14,916 2,172 4,719 21,807 Total assets 38,366 5,270 11,920 55,556 2019 Total revenue $ 111,751 $ 21,366 $ 19,586 $ 152,703 Operating income 3,063 924 750 4,737 Depreciation and amortization 1,126 143 223 1,492 Additions to property and equipment 2,186 303 509 2,998 Property and equipment, net 14,367 2,044 4,479 20,890 Total assets 32,162 4,369 8,869 45,400 2018 Total revenue $ 102,286 $ 20,689 $ 18,601 $ 141,576 Operating income 2,787 939 754 4,480 Depreciation and amortization 1,078 135 224 1,437 Additions to property and equipment 2,046 268 655 2,969 Property and equipment, net 13,353 1,900 4,428 19,681 Total assets 28,207 4,303 8,320 40,830 Disaggregated Revenue The following table summarizes net sales by merchandise category; sales from business centers and e-commerce websites have been allocated to their respective categories: 2020 2019 2018 Food and sundries $ 68,659 $ 59,672 $ 56,073 Hardlines 27,729 24,570 22,620 Fresh foods 23,204 19,948 18,879 Softlines 17,078 16,590 15,387 Ancillary and other 26,550 28,571 25,475 Total net sales $ 163,220 $ 149,351 $ 138,434 63 Table of Contents Note 13—Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) The two tables that follow reflect the unaudited quarterly results of operations for 2020 and 2019. 52 Weeks Ended August 30, 2020 First Quarter (12 Weeks) Second Quarter (12 Weeks) Third Quarter (12 Weeks) Fourth Quarter (16 Weeks) Total (52 Weeks) REVENUE Net sales $ 36,236 $ 38,256 $ 36,451 $ 52,277 $ 163,220 Membership fees 804 816 815 1,106 3,541 Total revenue 37,040 39,072 37,266 53,383 166,761 OPERATING EXPENSES Merchandise costs (1) 32,233 34,056 32,249 46,401 144,939 Selling, general and administrative (2) 3,732 3,743 3,830 5,027 (3) 16,332 Preopening expenses 14 7 8 26 55 Operating income 1,061 1,266 1,179 1,929 5,435 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Interest expense ( 38 ) ( 34 ) ( 37 ) ( 51 ) ( 160 ) Interest income and other, net 35 45 21 ( 9 ) 92 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 1,058 1,277 1,163 1,869 5,367 Provision for income taxes 202 330 311 465 1,308 Net income including noncontrolling interests 856 947 852 1,404 4,059 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests ( 12 ) ( 16 ) ( 14 ) ( 15 ) ( 57 ) NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COSTCO $ 844 $ 931 $ 838 $ 1,389 $ 4,002 NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO COSTCO: Basic $ 1.91 $ 2.10 $ 1.90 $ 3.14 $ 9.05 Diluted $ 1.90 $ 2.10 $ 1.89 $ 3.13 $ 9.02 Shares used in calculation (000’s) Basic 441,818 442,021 442,322 442,843 442,297 Diluted 443,680 443,727 443,855 444,231 443,901 _______________ (1) Includes $ 108 of incremental wage and sanitation costs as a result of COVID-19 of which $ 44 and $ 64 were recorded in the third and fourth quarters, respectively.

Item 9A—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 30, 2020 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 30, 2020, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 30, 2020. The attestation of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is included with the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report. 66 Table of Contents Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. /s/ W.

PART I Item 1—Business Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, France, Iceland, China, and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Costco operated 782 , 762 , and 741 warehouses worldwide at September 1, 2019 , September 2, 2018 , and September 3, 2017 , respectively. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol “COST.” We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2019 and 2018 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended September 1, 2019 , and September 2, 2018 , respectively. References to 2017 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2017 . General We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts. We buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. Our average warehouse space is approximately 146,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, 3 Table of Contents and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations. Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash, checks, and our proprietary stored-value card (shop card). Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,700 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only. In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items. We offer merchandise in the following categories: • Food and Sundries (including dry foods, packaged foods, groceries, snack foods, candy, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and cleaning supplies) • Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, and garden and patio) • Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, deli, and bakery) • Softlines (including apparel and small appliances) • Ancillary (including gasoline and pharmacy businesses) Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services, encouraging members to shop more frequently. These businesses include gas stations, pharmacies, optical dispensing centers, food courts, and hearing-aid centers. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we do not currently operate our gasoline business in Korea, France or China. We operated 593 gas stations at the end of 2019 . Net sales for our gasoline business represented approximately 11% of total net sales in 2019. Our e-commerce operations allow us to connect with our members online and provide additional products and services, many not found in our warehouses. At the end of 2019, we operated e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, and Taiwan. Net sales for e-commerce represented approximately 4% of total net sales in 2019 . Additionally, we offer business delivery, travel and various other services online in certain countries. We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. We generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business. We also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our members is significant. 4 Table of Contents Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Membership Our members may utilize their memberships at our warehouses worldwide. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or comparable document. Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $60 in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies in other countries. All paid memberships include a free household card. Our member renewal rate was 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% on a worldwide basis at the end of 2019 . The majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands): 2019 2018 2017 Gold Star 42,900 40,700 38,600 Business, including affiliates 11,000 10,900 10,800 Total paid members 53,900 51,600 49,400 Household cards 44,600 42,700 40,900 Total cardholders 98,500 94,300 90,300 Paid cardholders (except affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S. and Canada, for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive memberships are also available in Mexico, the U.K., and Korea, for which the additional annual fee varies. Executive members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year in the U.S. and Canada and varies in Mexico, the U.K. and Korea), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. This program also offers (except in Mexico and Korea), access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing. These services are generally provided by third parties and vary by state and country. Executive members, who represented 39% of paid members at the end of 2019 , generally shop more frequently and spend more than other members. Labor Our employee count was as follows: 2019 2018 2017 Full-time employees 149,000 143,000 133,000 Part-time employees 105,000 102,000 98,000 Total employees 254,000 245,000 231,000 Approximately 16,000 employees are union employees. We consider our employee relations to be very good. 5 Table of Contents Competition Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution strategy, and customer service. We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon.com are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with other warehouse clubs (primarily Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club), and many of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple club operations. Intellectual Property We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale ® trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland Signature ® . We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than national brands, and that they help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private-label items. We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.

We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management ' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Business and Operating Risks We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations. Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 87% and 84% of net sales and operating income in 2019 , respectively. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 30% of U.S. net sales in 2019 . Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among other things: slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products. We may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability. We seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance, member traffic, and profitability. We intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets, including China. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. We cannot ensure that new warehouses and new e-commerce websites will be profitable and, as a result, future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected. 8 Table of Contents Our failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations. Membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations. We sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products carried in our warehouses and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected. Disruptions in our merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction. We depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. We also rely upon processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income. We rely extensively on information technology to process transactions, compile results, and manage our business. Failure or disruption of our primary and back-up systems could adversely affect our business. A failure to adequately update our existing systems and implement new systems could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. Given the very high volume of transactions we process it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical systems. Our systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors or misfeasance by our employees. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations. Any material interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are currently making and will continue to make investments to improve or advance critical information systems and processing capabilities. Failure to monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace could be harmful. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process should mitigate this risk. Excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption, and could make it more 9 Table of Contents difficult for us to realize benefits. Targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. The potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. These initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost. We previously identified a material weakness in our internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls and if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control in the future, this could result in loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price. Internal controls related to the operation of technology systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of September 2, 2018, a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology systems that support the Company’s financial reporting processes. During 2019, we completed the remediation measures related to the material weakness and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 1, 2019 . Completion of remediation does not provide assurance that our remediation or other controls will continue to operate properly. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price. If we do not maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information, we could damage our reputation with members and employees, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation. We receive, retain, and transmit personal information about our members and employees and entrust that information to third-party business associates, including cloud service-providers that perform activities for us. Our warehouse and online businesses depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our security systems or defects within our hardware or software, or those of our business associates, that results in our members' or employees' information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation, government actions, or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a breach could require expending significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could disrupt our operations. The use of data by our business and our business associates is highly regulated in all of our operating countries. Privacy and information-security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to, among other things, systems changes and the development of new processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk or financial losses as a result of non-compliance. We have security measures and controls to protect personal and business information and continue to make investments to secure access to our information technology network. These measures may be undermined, however, due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, internal or external malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover or counter them, or implement adequate 10 Table of Contents preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are subject to payment-related risks. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash and checks, select credit and debit cards, and our shop card. As we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI DSS”), which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. We might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputation, and expose us to litigation. If our merchandise, such as food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children ' s products, pet products and durable goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members ' expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of health-related illness or injury to our members. Such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or faulty design. Our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause illness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image, and these effects could be long term. If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media. We are making investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. 11 Table of Contents Inability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel. Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for key senior management could negatively impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance. The Company is predominantly self-insured for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as any losses to the extent they exceed our aggregate limits of applicable coverages. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations. Market and Other External Risks We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors may have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results. General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Higher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreign-currency exchange rates, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal and tax policies including changes in tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, and other 12 Table of Contents economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to tariff impacts on the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our financial results. Prices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by events like the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism. Suppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins. We depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions leading to loss of sales and profits. We buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new suppliers, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available. Our suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, legal, regulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. During 2019 , our international operations, including Canada, generated 27% and 35% of our net sales and operating income, respectively. Our international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. Future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our Canadian and Other International operations and have a corresponding adverse period-over-period effect on our results of operations. As we continue to expand internationally, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase. 13 Table of Contents A portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold. Currency fluctuations may increase our cost of goods and may not be passed on to members. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. Natural disasters or other catastrophes could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, typhoons or earthquakes, particularly in California or Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our properties, the temporary closure of warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or members, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business. We use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. U.S. and foreign government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. Climate change and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which could face increased regulation. Failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. We believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new member sign-ups, gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the market price of our stock to decline. Legal and Regulatory Risks Our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. At the end of 2019 , we operated 239 warehouses outside of the U.S., and we plan to continue expanding our international operations. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which are beyond our control. These factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, policy changes such as the U.K.'s vote to withdraw from the European Union, commonly known as ""Brexit"", and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions), monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of 14 Table of Contents managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. Accounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities and income taxes, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We could be subject to additional tax liabilities. We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at any point in time, we may be under examination for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may recognize additional tax expense, be subject to additional tax liabilities, or incur losses and penalties, due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Significant changes in or failure to comply with regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with these laws could result in harm to our members, employees or others, significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines, penalties, and remediation costs. We are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed property laws, and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these proceedings, audits, unclaimed property laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management ' s attention and resources. 15 Table of Contents Item 1B—Unresolved Staff Comments None.

Additionally, we operate various fulfillment, processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Our executive offices are located in Issaquah, Washington, and we maintain 19 regional offices in the U.S., Canada and Other International locations. 16 Table of Contents Item 3—Legal Proceedings See discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

See Note 1 in Item 8. 19 Table of Contents Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data) Overview We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth. We define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions; and changes from the revenue recognition standard. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe that our gasoline business draws members but it generally has a significantly lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results. We also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales. 20 Table of Contents The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefits costs as a percentage of country sales, and/or less or no direct membership warehouse competition. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2019 and 2018 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended September 1, 2019 , and September 2, 2018 , respectively. References to 2017 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2017 . Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Highlights for 2019 included: • We opened 25 new warehouses, including 5 relocations: 16 net new locations in the U.S. and 4 in our Other International segment, including our first warehouse in China, compared to 25 new warehouses, including 4 relocations in 2018 ; • Net sales increased 8% to $149,351 driven by a 6% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2018 and 2019; • Membership fee revenue increased 7% to $3,352 , primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and the annual fee increase in the U.S. and Canada in June 2017. • Gross margin percentage decreased two basis points. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales increased eight basis points; • Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased two basis points. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard on net sales, SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales increased 11 basis points, primarily related to a $123 charge for a product tax assessment; 21 Table of Contents • Effective March 2019, starting and supervisor wages were increased and paid bonding leave was made available for hourly employees in the U.S. and Canada. The estimated annualized pre-tax cost of these increases is approximately $50-$60; • The effective tax rate in 2019 was 22.3% compared to 28.4% in 2018. Both years were favorably impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act) and other net tax benefits; • Net income increased 17% to $3,659 , or $8.26 per diluted share compared to $3,134 , or $7.09 per diluted share in 2018 ; and • In April 2019 , the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.57 to $0.65 per share and authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000.

See Note 1 in Item 8. Net Sales Net sales increased $10,917 or 8% during 2019 , primarily due to a 6% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2018 and 2019. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $1,463, or 106 basis points, compared to 2018, attributable to our Canadian and Other International Operations. The revenue recognition standard positively impacted net sales by $1,332, or 96 basis points. Changes in gasoline prices did not have a material impact on net sales. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 6% during 2019 and were positively impacted by increases in both shopping frequency and average ticket. Comparable sales were negatively impacted by cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). 22 Table of Contents Membership Fees 2019 2018 2017 Membership fees $ 3,352 $ 3,142 $ 2,853 Membership fees increase 7 % 10 % 8 % Membership fees as a percentage of net sales 2.24 % 2.27 % 2.26 % The increase in membership fees was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and the annual fee increase. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted membership fees by approximately $30 in 2019. At the end of 2019 , our member renewal rates were 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide. As reported in 2017, we increased our annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada and in certain of our Other International operations. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. These fee increases had a positive impact of approximately $178 in 2018 and positively impacted 2019, primarily the first two quarters, by approximately $73. Gross Margin 2019 2018 2017 Net sales $ 149,351 $ 138,434 $ 126,172 Less merchandise costs 132,886 123,152 111,882 Gross margin $ 16,465 $ 15,282 $ 14,290 Gross margin percentage 11.02 % 11.04 % 11.33 % The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased seven basis points primarily due to increases in food and sundries and fresh foods partially offset by decreases in softlines and hardlines. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Total gross margin percentage decreased two basis points compared to 2018. Excluding the impact of the revenue recognition standard on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.12%, an increase of eight basis points. This increase was primarily due to a 19 basis point increase in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly our gasoline business. This increase was partially offset by decreases of four basis points in our core merchandise categories, four basis points due to an adjustment to our estimate of breakage on rewards earned under our co-branded credit card program and three basis points due to increased spending by members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $155 in 2019. The segment gross margin percentage, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased in our U.S. operations, predominantly in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, primarily our gasoline business. This increase was partially offset by decreases in our core merchandise categories and the breakage adjustment noted above. The segment gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations decreased predominantly in hardlines and softlines and certain of our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, partially offset by an increase in fresh foods. The segment gross margin percentage in our Other International operations decreased primarily in our core merchandise categories and due to the introduction of the Executive Membership 2% reward program in Korea. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our gasoline business. 23 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2019 2018 2017 SG&A expenses $ 14,994 $ 13,876 $ 12,950 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 10.04 % 10.02 % 10.26 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased two basis points compared to 2018 . Excluding the impact of the revenue recognition standard on net sales, SG&A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales were 10.13%, an increase of 11 basis points. This increase is largely due to a $123 charge, or eight basis points, recorded in the U.S. related to a product tax assessment. Central operating costs were higher by two basis points and stock compensation expense was higher by one basis point. Operating costs as a percent of adjusted net sales related to warehouses, ancillary, and other businesses, which includes e-commerce and travel, were flat despite the wage increases and bonding leave benefits for U.S. and Canadian hourly employees effective in March 2019. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted SG&A expenses by approximately $124 in 2019. Preopening 2019 2018 2017 Preopening expenses $ 86 $ 68 $ 82 Warehouse openings, including relocations United States 18 17 15 Canada 3 3 6 Other International 4 5 7 Total warehouse openings, including relocations 25 25 28 Preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse and facility openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year-end, whether a warehouse is owned or leased, and whether openings are in an existing, new, or international market. In 2019, we opened our first warehouse in China. Subsequent to year end, operations commenced at our new poultry processing plant. Interest Expense 2019 2018 2017 Interest expense $ 150 $ 159 $ 134 Interest expense primarily relates to Senior Notes issued by the Company. Interest expense decreased in 2019 largely due to an increase in capitalized interest associated with our new poultry processing plant. 24 Table of Contents Interest Income and Other, Net 2019 2018 2017 Interest income $ 126 $ 75 $ 50 Foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), net 27 23 (5 ) Other, net 25 23 17 Interest income and other, net $ 178 $ 121 $ 62 The increase in interest income in 2019 was primarily due to higher interest rates earned on higher average cash and investment balances. Foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), net include the revaluation and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities and mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts by our Canadian and Other International operations. See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Item 8, Note 1 of this Report. Provision for Income Taxes 2019 2018 2017 Provision for income taxes $ 1,061 $ 1,263 $ 1,325 Effective tax rate 22.3 % 28.4 % 32.8 % Our effective tax rate for 2019 was favorably impacted by the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate in December 2017 from 35% to 21%, which was in effect for all of 2019, and compared to a higher blended rate effective for 2018. Net discrete tax benefits of $221 in 2019 included a benefit of $59 related to the stock-based compensation accounting standard adopted in the first quarter of 2018. This also included a tax benefit of $105 related to U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends, offset by losses of foreign tax credits, which impacted the effective tax rate. The tax rate for 2019 was 26.9%, excluding the net discrete tax benefits. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 2019 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 6,356 $ 5,774 $ 6,726 Net cash used in investing activities (2,865 ) (2,947 ) (2,366 ) Net cash used in financing activities (1,147 ) (1,281 ) (3,218 ) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $9,444 and $7,259 at the end of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $1,434 and $1,348 at the end of 2019 and 2018, respectively. These receivables generally settle within four days. Cash and cash equivalents were negatively impacted by a change in exchange rates of $15 and $37 in 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and positively impacted by $25 in 2017. Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. We no longer consider earnings after 2017 of our non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. 25 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $6,356 in 2019 , compared to $5,774 in 2018 . Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, payment terms with our suppliers, and the amount of payables paid early to obtain discounts from our suppliers. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,865 in 2019 , compared to $2,947 in 2018 , and primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash flows from investing activities also includes maturities and purchases of short-term investments. Capital Expenditures Our primary requirement for capital is acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations and working capital. In 2019 , we spent $2,998 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximat ely $3,000 to $3,200 d uring fiscal 2020. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 25 new warehous es, including five relocations, in 2019 , and plan to open approximately 22 additional new warehouses, including three relocations, in 2020. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,147 in 2019 , compared to $1,281 in 2018 . Cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to the payment of dividends, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, and repurchases of common stock. Dividends totaling $ 1,038 were paid during 2019, of which $250 related to the dividend declared in August 2018. In August 2019, approximately $200 and $100 of Guaranteed Senior Notes were issued by our Japanese subsidiary at fixed interest rates of 0.28% and 0.42%, respectively. Stock Repurchase Programs In April 2019, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, which expires in April 2023. This authorization revoked previously authorized but unused amounts, totaling $2,237 . During 2019 and 2018 , we repurchased 1,097,000 and 1,756,000 shares of common stock, at average prices of $225.16 and $183.13 , respectively, totaling approximately $247 and $322 , respectively. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,943 at the end of 2019 . These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Dividends Cash dividends declared in 2019 totaled $2.44 per share, as compared to $2.14 per share in 2018 . In April 2019 , the Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.57 to $0.65 per share. In August 2019 , the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.65 per share, which was paid subsequent to the end of 2019. 26 Table of Contents Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At September 1, 2019 , we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $865, including a $400 revolving line of credit, which expires in June 2020. The Company currently has no plans to draw upon this facility. Our international operations maintain $355 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $150 is guaranteed by the Company. There were no outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2019 and 2018 . The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $219. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2019 totaled $145, most of which were standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. Contractual Obligations At September 1, 2019 , our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2020 2021 to 2022 2023 to 2024 2025 and thereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise) (1) $ 8,752 $ 4 $ — $ — $ 8,756 Long-term debt (2) 1,828 2,594 1,330 1,651 7,403 Operating leases (3) 239 431 374 2,206 3,250 Construction and land obligations 606 8 — — 614 Capital lease obligations (4) 51 91 78 544 764 Purchase obligations (equipment, services and other) (5) 538 176 33 65 812 Other (6) 18 28 23 96 165 Total $ 12,032 $ 3,332 $ 1,838 $ 4,562 $ 21,764 _______________ (1) Includes only open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments and excludes deferred issuance costs. (3) Excludes common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $105 related to sub-lease income. (4) Includes build-to-suit lease obligations and contractual interest payments. (5) Excludes certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (6) Includes asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. The amount excludes $27 of non-current unrecognized tax contingencies and $36 of other obligations due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements, other than operating leases, included in the table above and discussed in Note 1 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 27 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities The Company is predominantly self-insured for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to seek to limit exposures arising from very large losses. We use different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, and participate in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims over time. While we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment also is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these positions and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. The 2017 Tax Act includes various provisions that significantly altered U.S. tax law, many of which impact our business (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion). Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions) Our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents, as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short-term investments are in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. 28 Table of Contents Our policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, U.S. government and government agency money market funds, and insured bank balances. Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers’ acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies. A 100 basis-point change in interest rates as of the end of 2019 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value. For those investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. The nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of 2019 , long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $6,852 . Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt. Foreign Currency Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to the Company's forward foreign-exchange contracts, see Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at September 1, 2019 , would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $79 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment. 29 Table of Contents Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Costco Wholesale Corporation: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 1, 2019 and September 2, 2018 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 52-week period ended September 1, 2019 , the 52-week period ended September 2, 2018 and the 53-week period ended September 3, 2017 , and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 1, 2019 and September 2, 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the 52-week period ended September 1, 2019 , the 52-week period ended September 2, 2018 and the 53-week period ended September 3, 2017 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 1, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated October 10, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 30 Table of Contents Evaluation of self-insurance liabilities As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated self-insurance liabilities as of September 1, 2019 were $ 1,222 million. We identified the evaluation of the Company’s self-insurance liabilities as a critical audit matter because of the specialized skills necessary to evaluate the Company’s actuarial models and the judgments required to assess the underlying assumptions made by the Company. Key assumptions underlying the Company’s actuarial estimates include: reporting and payment patterns used in the projections of the ultimate loss; loss and exposure trends; the selected loss rates and initial expected losses used in the Paid and Incurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods; and the selection of the ultimate loss derived from the various methods. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s self-insurance process. Such controls included controls over the (a) evaluation of claims information sent to the actuary, (b) development and selection of the key assumptions used in the actuarial calculation, and (c) review of the actuarial report and evaluation of the external actuarial expert’s qualifications, competency, and objectivity. We tested the claims data used in the actuarial calculation by selecting a sample and checking key attributes such as date of loss. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in: • Assessing the actuarial models used by the Company for consistency with generally accepted actuarial standards; • Evaluating the Company’s ability to estimate self-insurance liabilities by comparing its historical estimates with actual loss payments; • Evaluating the key assumptions underlying the Company’s actuarial estimates by developing an independent expectation of the self-insurance liabilities and comparing them to the amounts recorded by the Company; and • Evaluating the qualifications of the Company’s actuaries by assessing their certifications, and determining whether they met the Qualification Standards of the American Academy of Actuaries to render the statements of actuarial opinion implicit in their analyses. Performance of incremental audit procedures over IT financial reporting processes As of September 2, 2018, the Company identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology (IT) systems that support the Company’s financial reporting processes. Automated and manual business process controls that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. While our report dated October 10, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 1, 2019, during a portion of the 52-week period ended September 1, 2019, the ITGCs were ineffective and the information or system generated reports produced by the affected financial reporting systems could not be relied upon without further testing. We identified the performance of the necessary incremental audit procedures over the financial information reliant on the impacted IT systems as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment was required to design and execute the incremental audit procedures and to assess the sufficiency of the procedures performed and evidence obtained due to ineffective controls and the complexity of the Company’s IT environment. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist in the identification and design of the incremental procedures. We modified the types of procedures that were performed, which included: • Testing the underlying records of selected transaction data obtained from the impacted IT systems to support the use of the information in the conduct of the audit; and 31 Table of Contents • Involving forensic professionals with specialized skills and knowledge in data analysis to perform an evaluation of the journal entry data, including assessing that the entire population of automated and manual transactions has been identified. Forensic professionals also assisted with the identification of certain entries that required additional testing and for all such entries, we agreed the journal entry data to source documents. We evaluated the collective results of the incremental audit procedures performed to assess the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained related to the information produced by the impacted IT systems. Evaluation of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, H.R. 1, the ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" (2017 Tax Act) contains numerous provisions impacting the computation of the Company’s U.S. federal and state corporate income tax provision, including the Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI), Foreign Derived Intangibles Income (FDII) and Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) provisions. For the year ended September 1, 2019, the Company recognized net tax benefits of $123 million related to the 2017 Tax Act. We identified the evaluation of the Company’s implementation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act as a critical audit matter. A high degree of judgment was required to interpret the impact of the new tax law on the Company, especially given the complexity of the 2017 Tax Act and related Treasury Regulations. Further, evaluating the Company’s application of the GILTI, FDII and FTC provisions of the 2017 Tax Act required complex auditor judgment. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s income tax process, including controls over the (a) identification and interpretation of the relevant provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and related Treasury Regulations and (b) calculation of the impact of the GILTI, FDII and FTC provisions. We involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the Company’s interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Act. They developed an independent assessment of the impact of the GILTI, FDII and FTC provisions based on our understanding and interpretation, and compared it to the net tax benefits the Company recognized related to the 2017 Tax Act. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002. Seattle, Washington October 10, 2019 32 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Costco Wholesale Corporation: Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September 1, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 1, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 1, 2019 and September 2, 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 52-week period ended September 1, 2019, the 52-week period ended September 2, 2018 and the 53-week period ended September 3, 2017, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated October 10, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting ( Item 9A ). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 33 Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Seattle, Washington October 10, 2019 34 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (amounts in millions,

— COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At September 1, 2019 , Costco operated 782 warehouses worldwide: 543 in the United States (U.S.) located in 44 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 100 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 26 in Japan, 16 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, 11 in Australia, two in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France and China. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, and Taiwan. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company purchased its former joint-venture partner's remaining equity interest in its Korean operations. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2019 and 2018 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended September 1, 2019 , and September 2, 2018 , respectively. References to 2017 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2017 . Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to four days. Credit and debit card receivables were $ 1,434 and $ 1,348 at the end of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The Company provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as payments are presented. Included in accounts payable at the end of 2019 and 2018 are $ 673 and $ 463 , respectively, representing the excess of outstanding payments over cash on deposit at the banks on which the payments were drawn. The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 39 Table of Contents Short-Term Investments In general, short-term investments have a maturity at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Short-term investments classified as held-to-maturity are financial instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis. The Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment, using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company recognizes the loss in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2 , 3 , and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all other non-derivative financial instruments are based on independent external valuation information. The pricing process uses data from a variety of independent external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves including but not limited to treasury benchmarks and Libor and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable, using the fair value of the individual securities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred. Current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities include the Company's long-term debt, which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs, and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt is based primarily on reported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon interest rates, maturities, and credit. 40 Table of Contents Receivables, Net Receivables consist primarily of vendor, reinsurance, credit card incentive, third-party pharmacy and other receivables. Vendor receivables include volume rebates or other discounts. Balances are generally presented on a gross basis, separate from any related payable due. In certain circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor, in which case the receivables are presented on a net basis. Reinsurance receivables are held by the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and primarily represent amounts ceded through reinsurance arrangements gross of the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Credit card incentive receivables primarily represent amounts earned under the co-branded credit card arrangement in the U.S. Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members’ insurers. Other receivables primarily consist of amounts due from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items. Receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on historical experience and application of the specific identification method. Write-offs of receivables were immaterial in 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 . Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories consist of the following: 2019 2018 United States $ 8,415 $ 8,081 Canada 1,123 1,189 Other International 1,857 1,770 Merchandise inventories $ 11,395 $ 11,040 Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and inventory levels have been determined. As of September 1, 2019 and September 2, 2018 , U.S. merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated first-in, first-out (FIFO) after considering the lower of cost or market principle. Canadian and Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly valued using the cost and retail inventory methods, respectively, using the FIFO basis. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales, using estimates based on the Company’s experience. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates, provided that they are probable and reasonably estimable. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. In general, new building additions are classified into components, each with an estimated useful life, generally five to fifty years for buildings and improvements and three to twenty years for equipment and fixtures. Depreciation and amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives or the lease term, if shorter. Leasehold improvements made after the beginning of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are made. The Company capitalizes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. During development, these costs are included in construction in 41 Table of Contents progress. When the assets are ready for their intended use, these costs are included in equipment and fixtures and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally three to seven years. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or change the way an asset functions or that extend the useful life are capitalized. Assets removed during the remodel, refurbishment or improvement are retired. Assets classified as held-for-sale at the end of 2019 and 2018 were immaterial. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in circumstances may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For asset groups held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In the event that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal to the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale (disposal group), the carrying value is compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisals from third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. There were no impairment charges recognized in 2019 , 2018 or 2017 . Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities The Company is predominantly self-insured for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit exposures arising from very large losses. It uses different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive) and participates in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of 2019 and 2018 , these insurance liabilities were $ 1,222 and $ 1,148 in the aggregate, respectively, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature. The captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes other third-party participants. The reinsurance agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement of the next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program limit a participating members’ individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior activity. Derivatives The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts relate primarily to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding 42 Table of Contents contracts upon certain triggering events. At the end of 2019 and 2018 , the aggregate fair value amounts of derivative instruments in a net liability position and the amount needed to settle the instruments immediately if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered were immaterial. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were $ 704 and $ 717 at the end of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. See Note 3 for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2019 and 2018 . The unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 . The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodity products used in retail and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment. Foreign Currency The functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Revenues and expenses of the Company’s consolidated foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. The Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Generally, these include the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries revalued to their functional currency. Also included are realized foreign-currency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items were immaterial for 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 . Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and returns. The Company reserves for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. Merchandise Sales - The Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods. The Company also provides expanded products and services through warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The majority of revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is recognized upon shipment to the member to the extent there is no installation provided as a part of the contract. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Principal Versus Agent - The Company is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally is established when Costco is primarily responsible 43 Table of Contents for merchandising decisions, maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member service and satisfaction, and has pricing discretion. Membership Fees - The Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. Deferred membership fees at the end of 2019 and 2018 were $1,711 and $1,624 , respectively. In certain countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum of approximately $1,000 per year), which does not expire and can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2019 , 2018 and 2017, the net reduction in sales was $1,537 , $1,394 , and $1,281 respectively. Shop Cards - The Company sells and otherwise provides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for outstanding shop card balances as a shop card liability, net of estimated breakage. Previously, the shop cards were branded as cash cards. Co-Branded Credit Card Program - Citibank, N.A. (“Citi”) became the exclusive issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members in June 2016. The Company receives various forms of consideration, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco, a portion of which, after giving rise to estimated breakage, is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receive. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. Breakage is estimated based on redemption data. Merchandise Costs Merchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company’s depot and fulfillment operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses, and are reduced by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods and certain ancillary departments. Vendor Consideration The Company has agreements to receive funds from vendors for discounts and a variety of other programs. These programs are evidenced by signed agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebate or discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers’ compensation costs for warehouse employees (other than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses which are reflected in merchandise costs) as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, stock compensation expense, credit and debit card processing fees, utilities, as well as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse and e-commerce website operations. 44 Table of Contents Retirement Plans The Company's 401(k) retirement plan is available to all U.S. employees over the age of 18 who have completed 90 days of employment. The plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. The Company also has a defined contribution plan for Canadian employees and contributes a percentage of each employee's wages. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations have defined benefit and defined contribution plans that are not material. Amounts expensed under all plans were $614 , $578 , and $543 for 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively, and are predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Stock-Based Compensation Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted to employees generally vest over five years and allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based awards that would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. Actual forfeitures are recognized as they occur. Compensation expense for stock-based awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for the entire award. Awards for employees and non-employee directors provide for accelerated vesting of a portion of outstanding shares based on cumulative years of service with the Company. Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long-service term. The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense is predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Certain stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 7 for additional information on the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. Leases The Company leases land and/or buildings at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities, primarily under operating leases. Operating leases expire at various dates through 2068 , with the exception of one lease in the U.K., which expires in 2151 . These leases generally contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial lease term: (a) renewal for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase of the property at the then-fair market value; or (c) right of first refusal in the event of a third-party purchase offer. The Company accounts for its lease expense with free rent periods and step-rent provisions on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company more likely than not expects to exercise, from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rental increases based on price indices, or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. The Company has capital leases for certain warehouse locations, expiring at various dates through 2059 . Capital lease assets are included in land and buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense on capital lease assets is recorded as depreciation expense and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Capital lease liabilities are recorded at the lesser of the estimated fair market value of the leased property or the net present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments and are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Interest on these obligations is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. 45 Table of Contents The Company records an asset and related financing obligation for the estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements where it is considered the owner for accounting purposes, to the extent the Company is involved in the construction of the building or structural improvements or has construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy, the Company assesses whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If the Company continues to be the deemed owner, it accounts for the arrangement as a financing lease. The Company’s asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that at the end of a lease must be removed. These obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term based upon the estimated fair value of the costs to remove the improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same depreciation method as the leasehold improvement assets and are included with buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associated with these leases were immaterial at the end of 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses and are expensed as incurred. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized. The timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes as appropriate. Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco The computation of basic net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method for shares subject to RSUs. Stock Repurchase Programs Repurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and is applied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6 for additional information. 46 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, providing for changes in the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance requires disclosures sufficient to describe the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows. The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $16 as an increase to retained earnings, which is included in cash dividend declared and other in the consolidated statements of equity. The standard impacted the presentation and timing of certain revenue transactions. Specifically, the changes included gross presentation of the Company’s estimate of merchandise returns reserve and the related recoverable assets, recognizing shop card breakage over the period of redemption, and accelerating the recognition of certain e-commerce and special-order sales. Additionally, the Company’s evaluation under the standard of its status as a principal in certain revenue arrangements resulted in the recognition of additional sales on a gross basis. The effect of the standard on the Company's consolidated balance sheet was an increase to other current liabilities and other current assets of $649 and $698 at adoption and at the end of 2019 , respectively, related to the estimate of merchandise returns reserve and the related recoverable assets. The effect of the adoption of this standard on the Company's consolidated statement of income is as follows: As Reported ASU 2014-09 Effect Excluding ASU 2014-09 Effect 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2019 Net Sales $ 149,351 $ 1,332 $ 148,019 Merchandise Costs 132,886 1,324 131,562 Gross Margin (1) 16,465 8 16,457 ______________ (1) Net sales less merchandise costs. For related disaggregated revenue disclosures, see Note 11 . Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires recognition on the balance sheet of rights and obligations created by leases with terms greater than twelve months. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2020 and utilize the transition option, which allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption and does not require application of the guidance to comparative periods. The primary effect of adoption will be recording right-of-use assets and corresponding lease obligations for current operating leases. The Company has substantially completed its assessment of the new standard and estimates total assets and liabilities will increase by approximately $2,400 upon adoption. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact to the Company's consolidated statements of income or cash flows. The Company continues to evaluate the related disclosure requirements. 47 Table of Contents Note 2—Investments The Company’s investments were as follows: 2019: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 716 $ 6 $ 722 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 338 338 Total short-term investments $ 1,054 $ 6 $ 1,060 2018: Cost Basis Unrealized Losses, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 912 $ (14 ) $ 898 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 306 306 Total short-term investments $ 1,218 $ (14 ) $ 1,204 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the years ended September 1, 2019 , and September 2, 2018 . At the end of 2019 and 2018 , the Company's available-for-sale securities that were in a continuous unrealized-loss position were not material. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities in 2019. Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities were $39 and $202 during 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Gross realized gains or losses from sales of available-for-sale securities were not material in 2018 and 2017 . The maturities of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities at the end of 2019 are as follows: Available-For-Sale Held-To-Maturity Cost Basis Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 297 $ 297 $ 338 Due after one year through five years 402 407 0 Due after five years 17 18 0 Total $ 716 $ 722 $ 338 48 Table of Contents Note 3—Fair Value Measurement Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The tables below present information regarding the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the level within the hierarchy reflecting the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. 2019: Level 1 Level 2 Investment in government and agency securities (1) $ 0 $ 766 Forward foreign-exchange contracts, in asset position (2) 0 15 Forward foreign-exchange contracts, in (liability) position (2) 0 (4 ) Total $ 0 $ 777 2018: Level 1 Level 2 Money market mutual funds (3) $ 9 $ 0 Investment in government and agency securities (1) 0 903 Forward foreign-exchange contracts, in asset position (2) 0 16 Forward foreign-exchange contracts, in (liability) position (2) 0 (2 ) Total $ 9 $ 917 ______________ (1) At September 1, 2019 , $44 cash and cash equivalents and $722 short-term investments are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

(2) The asset and the liability values are included in other current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. (3) Included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying balance sheet. During and at the end of both 2019 and 2018 , the Company did not hold any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers in or out of Level 1 or 2 during 2019 and 2018 . Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. There were no fair value adjustments to these items during 2019 and 2018 . 49 Table of Contents Note 4—Debt Short-Term Borrowings The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $865 and $857 , in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Borrowings on these short-term facilities were immaterial during 2019 and 2018 , and there were no outstanding borrowings at the end of 2019 and 2018 . Long-Term Debt The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, which have various principal balances, interest rates, and maturity dates as described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain events, as defined by the terms of the Senior Notes, the holder has the right to require the Company to purchase this security at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the event. Interest on all outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs. Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary and are valued using Level 3 inputs. In October 2018, the Company's Japanese subsidiary repaid a Guaranteed Senior Note and in August 2019, issued approximately $200 and $100 of Guaranteed Senior Notes at fixed interest rates of 0.28% and 0.42% , respectively. Interest is payable semi-annually, and principal is due in August 2029 and August 2034 , respectively. At the end of 2019 and 2018 , the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $6,997 and $6,492 , respectively. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following: 2019 2018 1.70% Senior Notes due December 2019 $ 1,200 $ 1,200 1.75% Senior Notes due February 2020 500 500 2.15% Senior Notes due May 2021 1,000 1,000 2.25% Senior Notes due February 2022 500 500 2.30% Senior Notes due May 2022 800 800 2.75% Senior Notes due May 2024 1,000 1,000 3.00% Senior Notes due May 2027 1,000 1,000 Other long-term debt 852 613 Total long-term debt 6,852 6,613 Less unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 29 36 Less current portion (1) 1,699 90 Long-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,124 $ 6,487 _______________ (1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs. 50 Table of Contents Maturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows: 2020 $ 1,700 2021 1,094 2022 1,300 2023 94 2024 1,113 Thereafter 1,551 Total $ 6,852 Note 5—Leases Operating Leases The aggregate rental expense for 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 was $268 , $265 , and $258 , respectively. Sub-lease income and contingent rent were not material in 2019 , 2018 , or 2017 . Capital and Build-to-Suit Leases Gross assets recorded under capital and build-to-suit leases were $457 and $427 at the end of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. These assets are recorded net of accumulated amortization of $106 and $94 at the end of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. At the end of 2019 , future minimum payments, net of sub-lease income of $105 for all years combined, under non-cancelable operating leases with terms of at least one year and capital leases were as follows: Operating Leases Capital Leases (1) 2020 $ 239 $ 51 2021 229 53 2022 202 38 2023 193 39 2024 181 39 Thereafter 2,206 544 Total $ 3,250 764 Less amount representing interest (343 ) Net present value of minimum lease payments 421 Less current installments (2) (26 ) Long-term capital lease obligations less current installments (3) $ 395 _______________ (1) Includes build-to-suit lease obligations.

In August 2019, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.65 per share, which was paid subsequent to the end of 2019. Stock Repurchase Programs In April 2019 , the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000 , which expires in April 2023 . This authorization revoked previously authorized but unused amounts, totaling $2,237 . As of the end of 2019 , the remaining amount available for stock repurchases under the approved plan was $3,943 . The following table summarizes the Company’s stock repurchase activity: Shares Repurchased (000’s) Average Price per Share Total Cost 2019 1,097 $ 225.16 $ 247 2018 1,756 183.13 322 2017 2,998 157.87 473 These amounts may differ from repurchases of common stock in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation Plans The Company grants stock-based compensation, primarily to employees and non-employee directors. Grants to all executive officers are performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approvals, there have been amended and restated plans and new provisions implemented by the Company. RSUs are subject to quarterly vesting upon retirement or voluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25 years of service with the Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting date. On January 24, 2019, shareholders approved the adoption of the 2019 Incentive Plan, which replaced the Seventh Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (Seventh Plan). The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares ( 10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant under the Seventh Plan on January 24, 2019 and future forfeited shares from grants under the Seventh Plan up to a maximum aggregate of 27,800,000 shares ( 15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes. Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity RSUs granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over five and three years, respectively. Additionally, the terms of the RSUs, including performance-based awards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained 25 or more and five or more years of service with the Company, respectively. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on non-vested and undelivered shares. At the end of 2019 , 15,676,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs under the 2019 Incentive Plan. 52 Table of Contents The following awards were outstanding at the end of 2019 : • 6,268,000 time-based RSUs that vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time; • 228,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 150,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the certification of the attainment of specified performance targets for 2019. This certification occurred in September 2019, at which time a portion vested as a result of the long service of all executive officers. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. The following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2019 : Number of Units (in 000’s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at the end of 2018 7,578 $ 140.85 Granted 2,792 224.00 Vested and delivered (3,719 ) 155.65 Forfeited (155 ) 164.75 Outstanding at the end of 2019 6,496 $ 167.55 The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $224.00 , $156.19 , and $144.12 in 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2019 was $ 694 and the weighted-average period of time over which this cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2019 were approximately 2,194,000 RSUs vested but not yet delivered. Summary of Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits under the Company’s plans: 2019 2018 2017 Stock-based compensation expense before income taxes $ 595 $ 544 $ 514 Less income tax benefit (1) (128 ) (116 ) (167 ) Stock-based compensation expense, net of income taxes $ 467 $ 428 $ 347 _______________ (1) In 2019 and 2018, the income tax benefit reflects the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21% . Note 8— Taxes Income Taxes Income before income taxes is comprised of the following: 2019 2018 2017 Domestic $ 3,591 $ 3,182 $ 2,988 Foreign 1,174 1,260 1,051 Total $ 4,765 $ 4,442 $ 4,039 53 Table of Contents The provisions for income taxes are as follows: 2019 2018 2017 Federal: Current $ 328 $ 636 $ 802 Deferred 222 (35 ) 7 Total federal 550 601 809 State: Current 178 190 161 Deferred 26 22 8 Total state 204 212 169 Foreign: Current 405 487 389 Deferred (98 ) (37 ) (42 ) Total foreign 307 450 347 Total provision for income taxes $ 1,061 $ 1,263 $ 1,325 In December 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. Except for certain provisions, the 2017 Tax Act is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Company is a fiscal-year taxpayer, so most provisions became effective for 2019, including limitations on the Company’s ability to claim foreign tax credits, repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction, and limitations on certain business deductions. Provisions with significant impacts that were effective starting in the second quarter of 2018 and throughout 2019 included: a decrease in the U.S. federal income tax rate, remeasurement of certain net deferred tax liabilities, and a transition tax on deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings. The decrease in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to 21.0% was effective for all of 2019 and resulted in a blended rate for the Company of 25.6% for 2018. The reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate is as follows: 2019 2018 2017 Federal taxes at statutory rate $ 1,001 21.0 % $ 1,136 25.6 % $ 1,414 35.0 % State taxes, net 171 3.6 154 3.4 116 2.9 Foreign taxes, net (1 ) 0.0 32 0.7 (64 ) (1.6 ) Employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (18 ) (0.4 ) (14 ) (0.3 ) (104 ) (2.6 ) 2017 Tax Act (123 ) (2.6 ) 19 0.4 — — Other 31 0.7 (64 ) (1.4 ) (37 ) (0.9 ) Total $ 1,061 22.3 % $ 1,263 28.4 % $ 1,325 32.8 % During 2019, the Company recognized net tax benefits of $123 related to the 2017 Tax Act. This benefit primarily included $105 related to U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends, partially offset by losses of current year foreign tax credits. During 2018, the Company recognized a net tax expense of $19 related to the 2017 Tax Act. This expense included $142 for the estimated tax on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, and $43 for the reduction in foreign tax credits and other immaterial items, largely offset by a tax benefit of $166 for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities. 54 Table of Contents In 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized total net tax benefits of $221 and $57 , which included a benefit of $59 and $33 , respectively, related to the stock-based compensation accounting standard adopted in 2018 in addition to the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act noted above. In 2017, the Company ’ s provision for income taxes was favorably impacted by a net tax benefit of $104 , primarily due to the $82 tax benefit recorded in connection with the May 2017 special cash dividends paid by the Company to employees through the Company's 401(k) retirement plan. Dividends on these shares are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. There was no similar special cash dividend in 2019 or 2018. The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows: 2019 2018 Deferred tax assets: Equity compensation $ 74 $ 72 Deferred income/membership fees 180 136 Foreign tax credit carry forward 65 — Accrued liabilities and reserves 566 484 Total deferred tax assets 885 692 Valuation allowance (76 ) — Total net deferred tax assets 809 692 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment (677 ) (478 ) Merchandise inventories (187 ) (175 ) Foreign branch deferreds (69 ) — Other (21 ) (40 ) Total deferred tax liabilities $ (954 ) $ (693 ) Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets $ (145 ) $ (1 ) The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2019 and 2018 include deferred income tax assets of $398 and $316 , respectively, included in other assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $543 and $317 , respectively, included in other liabilities. In 2019, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $76 primarily related to foreign tax credits that we believe will not be realized due to limitations on the Company's ability to claim the credits during the carry forward period. The foreign tax credit carry forwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2027. The Company no longer considers fiscal year earnings of our non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries after 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign withholding (net of available foreign tax credits) on fiscal year earnings and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The Company continues to consider undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries prior to 2018, which totaled $2,924 , to be indefinitely reinvested and has not provided for withholding or state taxes. 55 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2019 and 2018 is as follows: 2019 2018 Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 36 $ 52 Gross increases—current year tax positions 5 6 Gross increases—tax positions in prior years 2 6 Gross decreases—tax positions in prior years 0 (17 ) Settlements (4 ) (1 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (12 ) (10 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 27 $ 36 The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2019 and 2018 , these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods is $24 and $32 at the end of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Interest and penalties recognized during 2019 and 2018 and accrued at the end of each respective period were not material. The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and in several foreign countries. Some audits may conclude in the next 12 months and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2014. Other Taxes The Company is undergoing multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Subsequent to the end of 2019, the Company received an assessment related to a product tax audit covering multiple years. The Company recorded a charge of $123 in 2019, but plans to protest the assessment. Other possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. Note 9—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of basic and of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000’s): 2019 2018 2017 Net income attributable to Costco $ 3,659 $ 3,134 $ 2,679 Weighted average basic shares 439,755 438,515 438,437 RSUs and other 3,168 3,319 2,500 Weighted average diluted shares 442,923 441,834 440,937 Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in a class action alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to member service assistants who act as greeters in the Company’s California warehouses.

In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, and third-party payors concerning the impacts of opioid abuse. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are federal cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and class actions filed in thirty-eight states on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions. In 2019 similar actions were commenced against the Company in state courts in Utah. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey and Oklahoma have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of these matters.

In November 2016 and September 2017, the Company received notices of violation from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection regarding hazardous waste practices at its Connecticut warehouses, primarily concerning unsalable pharmaceuticals. The relief to be sought is not known at this time. The Company is seeking to cooperate concerning the resolution of these notices. On February 13, 2019, the Company's affiliate in Spain received notice from the General Directorate on Environment and Sustainability of the Regional Government of Madrid that the Directorate was investigating issues concerning rain, sewage and hydrocarbon drainage related to the Company's warehouse in Getafe. In August the Company was advised that no fines would be sought in this matter. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 58 Table of Contents Note 11—Segment Reporting The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France, and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1 . Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally come under the responsibility of U.S. management.

Item 9A—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 1, 2019 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 1, 2019 , using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). As disclosed in Part II Item 9A Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018 , during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology (IT) systems that support the Company’s financial reporting processes. During 2019 , management implemented our previously disclosed remediation plan that included: (i) creating and filling an IT Compliance Oversight function; (ii) developing a training program addressing ITGCs and policies, including educating control owners concerning the principles and requirements of each control, with a focus on those related to user access and change-management over IT systems impacting financial reporting; (iii) developing and maintaining documentation underlying ITGCs to promote knowledge transfer upon personnel and function changes; (iv) developing enhanced risk assessment procedures and controls related to changes in IT systems; (v) implementing an IT management review and testing plan to monitor 62 Table of Contents ITGCs with a specific focus on systems supporting our financial reporting processes; and (vi) enhanced quarterly reporting on the remediation measures to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. During the fourth quarter of 2019 , we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented controls and found them to be effective. As a result we have concluded the material weakness has been remediated as of September 1, 2019 . Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Except for the changes in connection with our implementation of the remediation plan discussed above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. /s/ W.

Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services Segment Our Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment offers virtually everything needed for the laboratory. Our unique combination of self-manufactured and sourced products and extensive service offering enables our customers to focus on their core activities and helps them to be more efficient, productive and cost-effective. The segment also includes a comprehensive offering of outsourced services used by the pharmaceutical and biotech industries for drug development, clinical research, clinical trials services and commercial drug manufacturing. We serve the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic, medical device, government and other research and industrial markets, as well as the clinical laboratory market through five key businesses: Laboratory Products, Laboratory Chemicals, Research and Safety Market Channel, Pharma Services and Clinical Research. Our laboratory products are used for life science research and drug discovery and development to advance the prevention and cure of diseases and enhance quality of life. Our laboratory chemicals offering comprises a broad range of chemicals, solvents and reagents supporting virtually every laboratory application – from research and drug discovery to development and manufacturing. Our research and safety market channel offers a mix of products that are manufactured by Thermo Fisher, by third parties for us on a private-label basis, and by third parties under their brands but offered for sale through us. Our pharma services business provides the entire spectrum of development, manufacturing and clinical trials services for both small-molecule and large-molecule pharmaceuticals. Our clinical research business offers comprehensive, integrated clinical development and analytical services including all phases of development (i.e., Phases I-IV), peri- and post-approval and site and patient access services. During 2022, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business continued to support COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. The biosciences, bioproduction and laboratory equipment and consumables businesses also leveraged their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they 4 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. rapidly expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, through our pharma services business, we provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. Sales and Marketing We market and sell our products and services through a direct sales force, customer-service professionals, electronic commerce and third-party distributors. Our global team delivers a combination of innovative technologies, purchasing convenience and pharmaceutical services through our industry-leading brands, including Thermo Scientific, Applied Biosystems, Invitrogen, Fisher Scientific, Unity Lab Services, Patheon and PPD. We have approximately 15,000 sales personnel including highly trained technical specialists who enable us to better meet the needs of our more technical end-users. We also provide customers with product standardization and other supply-chain-management services to reduce procurement costs. New Products and Research and Development Our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business segments. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position. Resources Raw Materials Our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources. No single supplier is material, although for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design, certain materials components may be sourced from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such materials or components. Raw material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions. We employ many strategies, including the use of alternative materials, to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results. Patents, Licenses and Trademarks Patents are important in many aspects of our business. No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so important, however, that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest. Patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts. We protect some of our technology as trade secrets and, where appropriate, we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products. We also enter into license agreements with others to grant and/or receive rights to intellectual property rights. All trademarks, trade names, product names, graphics and logos of Thermo Fisher contained herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of Thermo Fisher or its subsidiaries, as applicable, in the United States and/or other countries. Solely for convenience, we may refer to trademarks in this Annual Report on Form 10-K without the ™ and ® symbols. Such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent permitted by law, our rights to our trademarks. To the extent other trademarks appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, they are the property of their respective owners. Seasonal Influences Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. Sales of seasonal products, such as COVID-19, allergy and flu tests and related diagnostic products, vary quarter to quarter and year to year. Competition The company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve. Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers, third-party distributors and service providers. Competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development. Our success primarily depends on the following factors: 5 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. • technical performance and advances in technology that result in new products and improved price/performance ratios; • product differentiation, availability and reliability; • the depth of our capabilities; • our reputation among customers as a quality provider of products and services; • customer service and support; • active research and application-development programs; and • relative prices of our products and services. Government Regulation Environmental Regulations We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations. In addition to these federal laws and regulations, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes and have authority over these matters under state laws. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements. A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. Our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters. Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material. For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial measures. Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984 to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites, and are currently under the State’s Licensed Site Remediation Professional Program. As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site, and, in 2008, the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the USEPA to complete a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study. In 2018, the USEPA issued a Record of Decision, setting forth the scope of required remediation work at the site, which includes upgrading a water treatment plant to address constituents such as chlorinated organic compounds, 1,4-dioxane, and perfluorooctanoic acid/perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOA/PFOS). In 2020, the court approved a consent decree that requires the company and another responsible party to finance and perform the required remediation work with USEPA oversight, which has been ongoing and is pending USEPA’s approval of the water treatment plant design. In 2011, our Life Technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the USEPA and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former Davis Landfill Superfund site in Smithfield, Rhode Island. After years of additional study, in September, 2020, USEPA revised its cleanup plan by selecting an interim remedial approach that includes groundwater treatment followed by additional monitoring of site conditions. Depending on the results of these treatment and monitoring activities over the next several years, USEPA anticipates selecting a final groundwater remedy for the site. In November 2021, the 2011 consent decree was amended to reflect the parties’ obligations to implement USEPA’s interim remedy, for which pre-design work commenced during 2022. We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters. We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $75 million at December 31, 2022. These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled. We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur. As a result we believe that our ultimate 6 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that the Company’s operations, products and services are subject to and other environmental contingencies, refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Laws and Regulations Our operations, and some of the products and services we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the development, testing, approval, production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies. As Thermo Fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, no such laws or regulations have had a material impact on our operations. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenues associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could also result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. For a discussion of risks related to changes in governmental regulations, refer to “ Risk Factors ” in Part I, Item 1A. Human Capital The success of Thermo Fisher is fueled by colleagues who are highly engaged and feel empowered to achieve their goals. Everything we do starts with our Mission – to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. Our colleagues understand the role they play in fulfilling that Mission and that inspires them to bring their best to work each day. Our Mission is not only a differentiator for us externally, but a motivator for us internally. Our culture is rooted in our 4i Values of Integrity, Intensity, Innovation and Involvement. Within this framework, we strive to create a safe, fair and positive working environment for our colleagues around the world. We want our teams to feel they have a stake in our success, a voice in our direction and to be empowered to make a difference for the key stakeholders we serve. Every year, we conduct an Employee Involvement Survey to solicit direct feedback from our colleagues on what we’re doing well and where we need to improve. We then compile the feedback to measure our progress using three key indices: Leadership, Involvement and Inclusion. Our continued focus on enhancing our culture helps position our company to be an even better place to work. We are committed to maintaining the strongest team in our industry, focusing on developing and retaining our colleagues, while leveraging our leadership to attract new colleagues to our company. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 130,000 colleagues globally, with an approximate regional distribution as follows: 67,000 based in the Americas, 21,000 in the Asia Pacific region, and nearly 42,000 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Diversity and Inclusion We recognize that the future aspirations outlined in our Vision for 2030, which serves as our long-term roadmap, will only be achievable if we have a culture that values diversity and inclusion. While diversity of gender and ethnicity are important – and we’re focused on continuously improving– for us, diversity of backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints is equally vital to our long-term success. When those differences are welcomed and supported, we create an inclusive workplace that unlocks the true benefits of diversity. Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) is not an initiative at Thermo Fisher. It’s woven into the fabric of our culture, and our colleagues are encouraged to openly share the wide range of perspectives they represent. We work together to create an 7 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. inclusive culture where our colleagues feel they belong and are empowered to contribute, collaborate and innovate. Embracing individual differences is critical to our success. For example, Thermo Fisher was named as a Top Female Friendly Company, Best Employer for Women, and Best Employer for Veterans by Forbes in 2022, Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion, as well as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality for the seventh consecutive year. Establishing this kind of environment is critical in empowering our colleagues so they can contribute their best ideas and bring their true selves to work each day. Our D&I focus is embedded in every stage of our colleague lifecycle – from recruiting to onboarding, training, development and longer-term career planning. We track our progress on our D&I strategic objectives through a core set of metrics that are reviewed during routine business operating mechanisms, including Quarterly Business Reviews, Human Resource Reviews, Board Reviews and through team dashboards that are shared each month with leaders across the company. This enables frequent, meaningful, data-driven discussions across our businesses and functions on a range of D&I factors, including gender and ethnic representation. This approach also ensures we consistently prioritize our opportunities to improve. We understand the critical role diversity plays in sustained business success, and our teams are empowered to ensure our workforce represents the customers we serve. Further, to provide additional transparency to our U.S. workforce demographics, following our report submission to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, we disclose our EEO-1 report on our website each year. We are committed to ensuring our colleagues have access to resources, awareness training and internal networks that offer support and guidance. Our D&I strategy is greatly enabled by our Business Resource Groups (BRGs), which bring together individuals with similar interests to share experiences, learn from each other and collaborate to identify solutions to business challenges. Our BRGs reinforce that all colleagues can make a difference for our customers, for each other and for our company. As of December 31, 2022, we had 9 global BRGs, with more than 230 local BRG chapters. Talent Development Our overarching goal from a talent perspective is to create opportunities for our colleagues to achieve their full potential and career aspirations here at Thermo Fisher. We focus on the entire lifecycle of a colleague’s career, from their initial recruitment, to onboarding, through ongoing development and training to enhance their skills so they are in the best position to deliver on their goals and achieve their career aspirations. In today’s environment, we know talent is a key competitive advantage, and that building the strongest team in the industry is critical to our future. From our colleague referral program, summer internships, university relations, to our Graduate Leadership Development Program, we continue to build strong internal and external sourcing channels. Once on board, talent development at Thermo Fisher is a key organizational capability. We continue to make significant investments to support our colleagues along every step of their career journey to help support their success. Our talent development framework incorporates a multi-faceted approach, including formal and self-paced training, networking opportunities, on-the-job stretch learning, coaching, mentoring and manager training utilizing contemporary technology solutions to support the broad needs of our workforce. We provide multiple programs at all career levels, from online learning for all colleagues through Thermo Fisher University, to focused trainings for managers at various experience levels, to our Global Leadership Program for executives. We also support our colleagues’ career advancement through our tuition reimbursement program. In a company our size, we can also actively manage our talent through rotational opportunities across our businesses, functions and geographies that help our colleagues gain new experiences, share knowledge and broaden their skills. Our executives and leaders participate in frequent talent discussions as well as formal reviews, leveraging workforce data and predictive analytics to better anticipate the talent requirements of our business based on our growth opportunities and market demand. Thermo Fisher is dedicated to talent development to meet our evolving business needs and to provide our colleagues with opportunities for long and fulfilling careers. Our colleagues are passionate about our company, and their role in our success, and it’s our responsibility to help them reach their full potential. Total Rewards We offer a comprehensive total rewards package that we regularly evaluate and measure against established benchmarks to ensure its effectiveness in recruiting and retention, and to position Thermo Fisher as an employer of choice. In 2022, we reinvested approximately $350 million of additional compensation payments to our colleagues to help them with the temporary impacts of high inflation. Our health and wellness programs provide competitive, flexible programs that our global colleagues and their families can count on. For example, for U.S. colleagues, we offer a choice of comprehensive national medical, dental and vision plans; a 8 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. wellness program, including valuable health incentive opportunities and tax-advantaged savings and spending accounts; as well as commuter benefits, employee assistance programs, optional group legal coverage, and company-paid disability, accident and life insurance. We also offer a company-paid proprietary program for cancer care called the Impact Program, which gives our colleagues and their families access to personalized support and direct lines of communication to experts in cancer genetics and genomics. Similar benefits are available in all countries around the world where we operate. We also invest in our colleagues’ financial health, helping them to grow and protect their savings, plan for the future and share in the success of the company they are helping to build. We deliver comprehensive rewards, including competitive base pay, and also provide a variety of incentive and equity programs that, by design, directly link the impact of colleague contributions to the company’s overall success. Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act The Russian Federal Security Service (the FSB) is designated as a blocked party under Executive Order 13382. While we have paused sales and manufacturing operations in Russia and Belarus, in the normal course of business, as authorized by General License 1B issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, our Russian affiliate responds to regulatory inquiries from the FSB and otherwise engages with the FSB as a licensing authority. These interactions did not result in any revenue or otherwise contribute to our net income for the quarter. Our Russian affiliate may respond to similar regulatory inquiries and otherwise continue to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority in the future, as necessary and to the extent permitted by applicable U.S. sanctions laws and regulations. Available Information The company files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Exchange Act. The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information that issuers, including the company, file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at www.sec.gov. We also make available free of charge on or through our own website at www.thermofisher.com our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

Risk Factors Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in Item 1. Business under the caption “Forward-looking Statements”. Industry and Economic Risks Our growth would suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets would diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. Both domestic and international markets experienced significant inflationary pressures in 2022 and inflation rates in the U.S., as well as in other countries in which we operate, continue at elevated levels for the near-term. If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, continue to be unstable, they could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of: • reducing demand for some of our products; • increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays; • increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; • increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services; • causing supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; and • creating longer sales cycles, and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds and slower adoption of new technologies. Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations. International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (which we refer to as the functional currency). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. As our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In 2022, currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $1.35 billion on revenues due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services. Some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of global and local political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including issues of geopolitical relations, the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions and/or sovereign debt issues, and may have a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices. As a result of these and other factors, our strategy to grow in emerging markets may not be successful, and growth rates in these markets may not be sustainable. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: • interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; • changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions; • changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers; 10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. • tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs adopted by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods; • the impact of public health epidemics/pandemics on the global economy, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; • uncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable; • the imposition of governmental controls; • diverse data privacy and protection requirements; • supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; • increases in materials, energy, labor or other manufacturing-related costs or higher supply chain logistics costs; • negative consequences from changes in tax laws; • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; • differing labor regulations; • differing protection of intellectual property; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and • geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war. Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies. Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget. An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending. We are subject to risks associated with public health epidemics and pandemics, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health epidemics and pandemics. COVID-19 has had an adverse impact on certain of our operations, supply chains and distribution systems, and we may experience unpredictable reductions in supply and demand for certain of our products and services. National, state and local governments have implemented and may continue to implement safety precautions, including quarantines, border closures, increased border controls, travel restrictions, shelter in place orders and shutdowns and other measures. These measures may disrupt normal business operations and may have significant negative impacts on businesses and financial markets worldwide. Our ability to continue to manufacture products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our factory employees. The ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or future epidemics and pandemics. In addition, the duration and extent of future revenues from sales of products related to the COVID-19 response are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing demand as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Business Risks We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change, respond to introductions of new products by competitors and maintain quality to remain competitive. Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenues and operating results would suffer. Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, safety, quality, product and manufacturing-process levels. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to adequately develop products or predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenues. 11 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including: • strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; • allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; • developing new applications for our technologies; • expanding our service offerings; • continuing key customer initiatives; • combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively; • finding new markets for our products; and • continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings. We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business. Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us. Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor. Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us. In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers. We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers. Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us. Our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals, as well as disputes or litigation. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company. Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business. Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $41.20 billion and $1.24 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $16.21 billion as of December 31, 2022. We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. We assess the realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. Operational Risks Our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials or components could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. Some of our businesses purchase certain materials from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties, or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability or increased cost of key raw materials or commodities, such as energy, and external events such as global economic downturns and macroeconomic trends, natural disasters, pandemic health issues such as COVID-19, war, terrorist actions, governmental 12 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies. A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business. As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We also rely on our information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners) and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as interacting with suppliers, selling our products and services, fulfilling orders and billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers, tracking customer activity, fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise conducting business). Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, phishing, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results. Our key business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. Any of the cyber-attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above, if significant, could materially interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches. If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the U.S., individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation imposes significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data. Several countries, such as China, have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. We may have difficulty attracting and retaining a highly qualified workforce. Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical, clinical and management workforce in a highly competitive environment. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. We may face difficulty in attracting and retaining key talent for a number of reasons, including management changes or recruitment by competitors. Our ability to attract and retain key talent also depends in part on how well we maintain a strong workplace culture that is attractive to employees. Macroeconomic conditions, specifically increased competition for employees and wage inflation, could have a material impact on our ability to attract and retain talent, our turnover rate and the cost of operating our business. We cannot ensure that we will be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary for our operations or that the loss of any personnel will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flows. Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel. The costs for these commodities, as well as the costs of transportation, construction and services necessary for the production and distribution of our products, continue to increase and be volatile. While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs. 13 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe. We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected. Natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may disrupt our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, and could impact customer spending. We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk. An earthquake or other natural disaster (including the effects of climate change such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and more intense weather events), could disrupt our operations or impair our critical systems. Any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control, such as strikes or other labor unrest, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing or warehouse facilities, or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, fires, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict, or other events outside of our control, such as trade protectionism, strikes or other labor unrest, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact customer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally, which could also adversely impact our operating results. Increasing attention to environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business, financial results, stock price or reputation. We face increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to our environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and disclosures, including practices and disclosures related to climate change, diversity and inclusion and governance standards. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, lenders, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and disclosures and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. In addition, government organizations are enhancing or advancing legal and regulatory requirements specific to ESG matters. The heightened stakeholder focus on ESG issues related to our business requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving laws, regulations, standards and expectations and the associated reporting requirements. A failure to adequately meet evolving stakeholder expectations may result in noncompliance, the loss of business, reputational impacts, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers and an inability to attract and retain top talent. In addition, if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the U.S. or in any other jurisdiction in which we do business that impose more stringent restrictions and requirements than our current legal or regulatory obligations, we and companies in our supply chain may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations, which could cause disruption in the sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our adoption of certain standards or mandated compliance to certain requirements could necessitate additional investments that could impact our profitability. Legal, Quality and Regulatory Risks Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, we manufacture pharmaceuticals and many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (the FDA) regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenues associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the 14 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. Our pharma services offerings are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers, our business could suffer. Our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements. Our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our quality management strategy and systems, and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. A failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products. In each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether. In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such failure could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenues, reimbursement to customers for lost drug product, registered intermediates, registered starting materials, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, other customer claims, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. Production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high. If problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market, we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of which could be significant. We are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. We may be named as a defendant in product liability or errors and omissions lawsuits, which may allege that products or services we have provided have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition, property damage or injury to end users or financial loss for consumers. Additionally, products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims. In addition, patients involved in our clinical services trials conducted by our clinical development services business or taking drugs approved on the basis of those trials may also bring personal injury claims against us. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities subject to insurance policy exclusions where insurance would not respond or in excess of our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability and errors and omissions insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all. We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies. We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS), the European Medicines Agency (the EMA), the EU member states and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of, the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale. The manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices, and our pharma and clinical development services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients or personal injury, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. We are the sole manufacturer of a number of pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers’ ability to provide products to their customers. We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, business partners or other third parties. We have internal controls and compliance systems to protect the company against acts committed by employees, agents or businesses that we acquire that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy, but these controls and systems may not be sufficient to prevent every such wrongful act. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies which we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements. In addition, any allegations of issues resulting from the misuse of our products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to purchase products from us. Any such allegations could cause us to lose customers and divert our resources from other tasks, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the U.S. and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may not adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. 16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. We also depend in part on our trademarks and the strength of our proprietary brands, which we consider important to our business. If we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our intellectual property rights for any reason, including our inability to successfully defend against counterfeit, knock offs, grey-market, infringing or otherwise unauthorized products, our brand and reputation could be damaged, and our business may be harmed. Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to Financial Profile Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Our existing and future indebtedness may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities and negatively impact our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $34.49 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (the Facility). We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain a financial ratio, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities and create liens. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5:1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as the impact of foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for 2020 is included in Item 7 of the company’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company refers to various amounts or measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to their most directly comparable amount or measure under the section “ Non-GAAP Measures ” later in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through 18 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. The company’s operations fall into four segments (Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services. Consolidated Results (Dollars in millions except per share amounts) 2022 2021 Change Revenues $ 44,915 $ 39,211 15 % GAAP operating income $ 8,393 $ 10,028 (16) % GAAP operating income margin 18.7 % 25.6 % (6.9) pt Adjusted operating income (non-GAAP measure) $ 10,985 $ 12,138 (9) % Adjusted operating income margin (non-GAAP measure) 24.5 % 31.0 % (6.5) pt GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. $ 17.63 $ 19.46 (9) % Adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP measure) $ 23.24 $ 25.13 (8) % Organic Revenue Growth Revenue growth 15 % Impact of acquisitions 18 % Impact of currency translation (3) % Organic revenue growth* (non-GAAP measure) 0 % * Results may not sum due to rounding. Since 2020, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business have supported COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The biosciences and bioproduction businesses have expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they have expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, our pharma services business has provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2023, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Sales of products related to COVID-19 testing were $3.11 billion and $7.26 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. During 2022 demand from pharma and biotech customers was very strong, driven by our differentiated customer value proposition and trusted partner status. We saw good growth in the academic and government market as we remain well positioned to meet customer needs. The industrial and applied market was strong, driven by robust demand for our analytical instruments serving our semi-conductor and materials science customers. The diagnostics and healthcare market declined due to decreased demand for COVID-19 testing products. During 2022, robust sales growth in North America and the Asia Pacific region, including China, was partially offset by a decline in COVID-19 testing demand. In Europe, strong sales were more than offset during 2022 due to lower COVID-19 testing demand. Contributions to organic revenue during 2022 were driven by the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services and Analytical Instruments segments, as offset by the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments. The company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars: • Developing high-impact, innovative new products, • Leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets, and • Delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. GAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin decreased in 2022 due primarily to lower COVID-19 testing volumes, continued strategic growth investments, and the expected impact of incorporating recent acquisitions. This was partially offset by strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation while also driving strong productivity. GAAP operating income margin in 2022 was also impacted by higher amortization expense as a result of 2021 acquisitions. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to 19 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Notable Recent Acquisitions On January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, the Belgium-based European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS. The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers. The acquisition expands the segment’s capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies. On February 25, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Mesa Biotech, Inc., a U.S.-based molecular diagnostic company. Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a PCR based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19. The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care. On September 30, 2021, the company assumed operating responsibility, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, of a new state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland from CSL Limited to perform pharma services for CSL with capacity to serve other customers as well. On December 8, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, PPD, Inc., a U.S.-based global provider of clinical research services to the pharma and biotech industry. The addition of PPD’s clinical research services enhances our offering to biotech and pharma customers by enabling them to accelerate innovation and increase their productivity within the drug development process. On December 30, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, PeproTech, Inc., a U.S.-based developer and manufacturer of recombinant proteins. PeproTech provides bioscience reagents known as recombinant proteins, including cytokines and growth factors. The acquisition expands the segment’s bioscience offerings. On January 3, 2023, the company acquired, within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, The Binding Site Group, a U.K.-based provider of specialty diagnostic assays and instruments to improve the diagnosis and management of blood cancers and immune system disorders. The acquisition expands the segment’s portfolio with the addition of pioneering innovation in diagnostics and monitoring for multiple myeloma. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits as defined in Note 4. Accordingly, the following segment data are reported on this basis. (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $ 13,532 $ 15,631 Analytical Instruments 6,624 6,069 Specialty Diagnostics 4,763 5,659 Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services 22,511 14,862 Eliminations (2,515) (3,010) Consolidated revenues $ 44,915 $ 39,211 Life Sciences Solutions Organic* (non-GAAP measure) (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Total Change Currency Translation Acquisitions/ Divestitures Revenues $ 13,532 $ 15,631 (13) % (3) % 1 % (12) % Segment income $ 5,582 $ 7,817 (29) % Segment income margin 41.2 % 50.0 % (8.8) pt The decrease in organic revenues in 2022 was primarily due to lower revenue in the genetic sciences business, driven by moderation in testing demand to diagnose COVID-19, partially offset by growth in the bioproduction business. The decrease in segment income margin resulted primarily from business mix and strategic growth investments, partially offset by productivity improvements. 20 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Analytical Instruments Organic* (non-GAAP measure) (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Total Change Currency Translation Acquisitions/ Divestitures Revenues $ 6,624 $ 6,069 9 % (5) % 0 % 14 % Segment income 1,507 1,197 26 % Segment income margin 22.8 % 19.7 % 3.1 pt The increase in organic revenues in 2022 was due to increased demand across all the segment’s businesses, with particular strength in the electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. The increase in segment income margin resulted primarily from profit on higher sales, productivity improvements and business mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments. Specialty Diagnostics Organic* (non-GAAP measure) (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Total Change Currency Translation Acquisitions/ Divestitures Revenues $ 4,763 $ 5,659 (16) % (3) % 0 % (13) % Segment income 1,024 1,280 (20) % Segment income margin 21.5 % 22.6 % (1.1) pt The decrease in organic revenues in 2022 was primarily driven by products addressing diagnosis of COVID-19, partially offset by growth in the immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. The decrease in segment income margin was primarily due to lower COVID-19 testing volume, largely offset by productivity improvements and positive business mix. Segment income margin in 2021 was also impacted by a $13 million credit to cost of product revenue as a result of changing the method of accounting for inventories. Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services Organic* (non-GAAP measure) (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Total Change Currency Translation Acquisitions/ Divestitures Revenues $ 22,511 $ 14,862 51 % (3) % 45 % 10 % Segment income 2,872 1,844 56 % Segment income margin 12.8 % 12.4 % 0.4 pt The increase in organic revenues in 2022 was primarily due to higher sales across each of the segment’s businesses, with particular strength in the pharma services business and research and safety market channel. PPD, the company’s clinical research business, contributed $7.11 billion of revenue during 2022. The increase in segment income margin was primarily due to the benefit of recent acquisitions, profit on higher sales, and productivity improvements, offset in part by strategic growth investments. Segment income margin in 2021 was also impacted by a $20 million credit to cost of product revenue as a result of changing the method of accounting for inventories. * Results may not sum due to rounding Non-operating Items (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Net interest expense $ 454 $ 493 GAAP other income/(expense) (104) (694) Adjusted other income/(expense) (non-GAAP measure) 13 38 GAAP tax rate 9.0 % 12.5 % Adjusted tax rate (non-GAAP measure) 13.0 % 14.6 % Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) decreased due primarily to lower average interest rates on debt and higher average interest rates on cash balances, partially offset by the increase in debt to finance the acquisition of PPD and for general corporate purposes. See additional discussion under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. GAAP other income/(expense) and adjusted other income/(expense) includes currency transaction gains, losses on non-operating monetary assets and liabilities, and net periodic pension benefit cost/income, excluding the service cost component. GAAP other income/(expense) in 2022 also includes $160 million of net losses on investments, $26 million of losses on the 21 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. early extinguishment of debt (Note 10), partially offset by $67 million of net gains on derivative instruments to address certain foreign currency risks and $2 million of net settlement gains on pension plans. GAAP other income/(expense) in 2021 also includes $767 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt and $36 million of financing costs associated with obtaining bridge financing commitments in connection with the agreement to acquire PPD (Note 2), offset in part by $66 million of net gains on investments. The company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to releases of valuation allowances of $87 million in 2022 in jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are now expected to be realized. The company’s 2022 GAAP tax rate was also impacted by changes in tax rates and higher amortization expense as a result of 2021 acquisitions, as well as a net benefit of $208 million resulting from tax audit settlements (see Note 8). The company’s 2021 GAAP and adjusted tax rates were also impacted by income tax benefits on intra-entity transactions totaling $284 million. The effective tax rate in both 2022 and 2021 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $1.23 billion and $2.18 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The company expects its GAAP effective tax rate in 2023 will be between 7% and 9% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. The company expects its adjusted tax rate will be approximately 11% in 2023. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 70 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources The company’s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets. The company deploys its capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends. December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 8,524 $ 4,477 Total debt 34,488 34,870 Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions, capacity expansion, and repayment of third-party foreign debt by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. As of December 31, 2022, the company’s short-term debt totaled $5.58 billion. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 10). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit. 22 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. (In millions) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,154 $ 9,312 Net cash used in investing activities (2,159) (21,932) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (2,810) 6,581 Free cash flow (non-GAAP measure) 6,935 6,809 Operating Activities During 2022, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $0.43 billion and $0.83 billion, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $0.65 billion. Cash payments for income taxes were $1.23 billion during 2022. During 2021, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $0.20 billion and $1.07 billion, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $0.48 billion. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $0.72 billion primarily due to the timing of tax and incentive compensation payments. Cash payments for income taxes were $2.18 billion during 2021. The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading “ Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters, ” in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Investing Activities During 2022, acquisitions used cash of $0.04 billion. The company’s investing activities were principally for the purchase of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. During 2021, acquisitions used cash of $19.40 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $2.52 billion of property, plant and equipment. The company expects that for all of 2023, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be approximately $2.0 billion. Financing Activities During 2022, issuance of senior notes provided $3.19 billion in cash. Repayment of senior notes and net commercial paper activity used cash of $0.38 billion and $2.16 billion, respectively. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock (5.3 million shares) and the payment of $0.46 billion in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock. All of the shares of common stock repurchased by the company during the fourth quarter of 2022 were purchased under this program, depleting the 2021 authorization. On November 10, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.00 billion of the company’s common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2023, the company repurchased $3.00 billion of the company's common stock (5.2 million shares). At February 23, 2023, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. During 2021, issuance of senior notes provided $18.14 billion of cash. A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $2.51 billion. Repayment of debt used cash of $11.74 billion, including $4.30 billion to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition of PPD. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $0.40 billion in cash dividends. In addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2022, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11), pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12). Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company’s short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and foreign currency translation on 23 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods. We report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company’s core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable: • Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs. • Costs/income associated with restructuring activities and large-scale abandonments of product lines, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities and large-scale abandonment of product lines are not indicative of our normal operating costs. • Equity in earnings/losses of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. • The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. • The tax impacts of the above items and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as changes in deferred taxes from enacted tax rate/law changes), the latter of which we exclude because they are outside of our normal operations and difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We report free cash flow, which is operating cash flow excluding net capital expenditures, to provide a view of the continuing operations’ ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. The company also uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. The non-GAAP financial measures of the company’s results of operations and cash flows included in this Form 10-K are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for the company’s results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth within the “Overview” and “Results of Operations” sections and below.

Adjusted results in 2022 also exclude a $423 million charge for the impact of deferred tax realizability assessments as a result of audit settlements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquisition-related measurements and income taxes. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: Acquisition-related Measurements Business Combinations The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses, which include estimates of customer attrition and technology obsolescence rates. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. See Note 2 for additional information about our recent business combinations. Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, among others. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $41.20 billion and $1.24 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2022 (see Note 1 for additional information). Estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and other factors. For the goodwill impairment tests, the company also considers (i) peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and (ii) estimated weighted average costs of capital. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. Except as described below, the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for all of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Determinations of fair value based on projections of discounted cash flows, which decreased from the prior year projections primarily due to higher discount rates, and based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples, which also decreased from the prior year, were sufficient to conclude that no impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2022, the date of the company’s annual impairment testing. There were no interim impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2022. There can be no assurance, however, that adverse events or conditions will not cause the fair values of these assets to decline. Should the fair values of the company’s reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rates, charges for impairment may be necessary. With the completion of the PPD acquisition in December 2021, the company established two new reporting units that solely consist of the legacy PPD businesses, the book carrying values of which equaled their fair values as of the acquisition date. During its annual 2022 goodwill impairment assessments, the company performed qualitative assessments of these reporting units and determined that no events had occurred and no circumstances had changed that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair values of the reporting units below their carrying amounts. As a result, the company did not perform the quantitative goodwill impairment tests for these reporting units. Given that the fair values of the reporting units were unlikely to be substantially in excess of their carrying values as of the annual 2022 assessment date, relatively small decreases in future cash flows versus anticipated results, decreases in peer trading multiples and/or increases in weighted average costs of capital could result in impairment of goodwill. The reporting units consisting of the legacy PPD businesses had $13.41 billion of goodwill, and an overall carrying value of $19.30 billion as of December 31, 2022. Definite-lived Intangible Assets Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $16.21 billion at December 31, 2022 (see Note 1 for additional information). Certain definite-lived intangible assets have largely independent cash flows. The company reviews these definite-lived intangible assets for impairment individually when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows, which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. Most of the company’s definite-lived intangible assets are used in conjunction with other assets, such as property, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets. In these situations, the company considers 26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. the asset groups to be the units of account for impairment testing. The company recorded impairments of $0.12 billion in 2021 (see Note 16). Income Taxes Unrecognized Tax Benefits In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. The company’s liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled $0.57 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to $1.12 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of an audit settlement (see Note 8). The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the company to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income. Valuation Allowances The company estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which the company has been able to determine that its deferred tax assets will be realized, that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $1.32 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to $0.97 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily driven by the assessment of additional tax assets resulting from an audit settlement during the year (see Note 8). Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “ Recent Accounting Pronouncements ” in Note 1. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollars, Czech koruna and Swedish krona. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2022, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2022 was $30.29 billion (Note 14). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2022 would increase by approximately $2.00 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2022 would decrease by approximately $1.75 billion. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. In 2022, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variable-rate debt would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $35 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Swedish krona, Canadian dollars, Norwegian kroner and Danish kroner. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2022 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of approximately $1.45 billion. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2022 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an additional unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $9 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2022 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $9 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2022 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $21 million on the company’s net income. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data This data is submitted as a separate section to this report. See Item 15 “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. ” Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting. 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The company’s management, including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The company’s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, the company’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. The company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report that appears on page F-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely F-2 detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Income taxes As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $703 million. The Company has deferred tax liabilities, net, of $1,984 million (including a valuation allowance of $1,322 million) and unrecognized tax benefits of $572 million as of December 31, 2022. As disclosed by management, the Company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires management to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and to use estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Management assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, management has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Management estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which management has been able to determine that the Company’s deferred tax assets will be realized, that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, management reverses the related valuation allowance. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to income taxes is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when interpreting the numerous and complex tax laws and regulations as it relates to determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the valuation allowance, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the valuation allowance, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the valuation allowance, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the accuracy of the provision for income taxes, including the rate reconciliation and permanent and temporary differences, (ii) evaluating whether the data utilized in the calculations of the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were appropriate and consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit, (iii) evaluating management’s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis, (iv) F-3 evaluating the identification of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and the reasonableness of the more likely than not determination in consideration of court decisions, legislative actions, statutes of limitations, and developments in tax examinations by jurisdiction, (v) testing the calculation of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits by jurisdiction, including estimates of the amount of income tax benefit expected to be sustained, and (vi) evaluating the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgments and estimates related to the application of foreign and domestic tax laws and regulations. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 23, 2023 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

F-9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The company accounts for investments in businesses using the equity method when it has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control (generally between 20% and 50% ownership), is not the primary beneficiary and has not elected the fair value option. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the company had such investments with carrying amounts of $ 369 million and $ 576 million, respectively. The company has elected the fair value option of accounting for certain of its investments with readily determinable fair values that would otherwise be accounted for under the equity method. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of such investments was $ 7 million and $ 217 million, respectively. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest The company owns 60 % of its consolidated subsidiary PPD-SNBL K.K. The 40 % ownership interest held by a third party is classified as a redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheet due to certain put options under which the third party may require the company to purchase the remaining ownership interest at a premium upon the occurrence of certain events. Presentation Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. Revenue Recognition Consumables revenues consist of single-use products and are recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Instruments revenues typically consist of longer-lived assets that, for the substantial majority of sales, are recognized at a point in time in a manner similar to consumables. Service revenues (primarily clinical research, pharmaceutical, and instrument and enterprise services) are recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of such services. For revenues recognized over time, the company generally uses costs accumulated relative to total estimated costs to measure progress as this method approximates satisfaction of the performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the consideration to which it expects to be entitled (i.e., the transaction price) to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognizes the related revenues when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. The company exercises judgment in determining the timing of revenue by analyzing the point in time or the period over which the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the asset. The company immediately expenses contract costs that would otherwise be capitalized and amortized over a period of less than one year. Changes to the scope of services contracts generally also include changes in the transaction price. Typically, these contract modifications are not distinct from existing services provided under the contract, and result in cumulative adjustments to revenue on the modification date. Payments from customers for most instruments and consumables are typically due in a fixed number of days after shipment or delivery of the product. Service arrangements commonly call for payments in advance of performing the work (e.g., extended service contracts), upon completion of the service (e.g., pharmaceutical services) or a mix of both. Some arrangements include variable amounts of consideration that arise from discounts, rebates, and other programs and practices. In such arrangements, the company estimates the amount by which to reduce the stated contract amount to reflect the transaction price. The company records reimbursement for third-party pass-through and out-of-pocket costs as revenues and the related expenses as costs of revenues. F-10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Contract-related Balances Accounts receivable include unconditional rights to consideration from customers, which generally represent billings that do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimates of expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on history of similarly aged receivables, the creditworthiness of the customer, reasons for delinquency, current economic conditions, expectations associated with future events and circumstances where reasonable and supportable forecasts are available and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. Receivables from academic and government customers as well as large, well-capitalized commercial customers have historically experienced less collectability risk. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers. Contract assets include revenues recognized in advance of billings where the company’s right to bill includes something other than the passage of time. Such amounts are recorded net of estimated losses resulting from the inability to invoice customers, which is primarily due to risk associated with the company’s performance. Contract assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the amount of time expected to lapse until the company's right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities include billings in excess of revenues recognized, such as those resulting from customer advances and deposits and unearned revenues on service contracts. Contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the periods over which remaining performance obligations are expected to be transferred to customers. Contract assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheet if they arise from different performance obligations in the same contract. Warranty Obligations The company provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties, primarily from historical information, in cost of product revenues at the time product revenues are recognized. The liability for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. Extended warranty agreements are considered service contracts, which are discussed above. Costs of service contracts are recognized as incurred. Leases Operating leases that have commenced are included in other assets, other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases that have commenced are included in property, plant and equipment, net, current maturities of long-term obligations and long-term obligations in the consolidated balance sheet. Classification of lease liabilities as either current or noncurrent is based on the expected timing of payments due under the company’s obligations. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The company recognizes operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense includes depreciation, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the leased asset, and an immaterial amount of interest expense. Because most of the company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the company estimates incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. Lease terms include the effect of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As a lessee, the company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Research and Development The company conducts research and development activities to increase its depth of capabilities in technologies, software and services. Research and development costs include employee compensation and benefits, consultants, facilities related costs, material costs, depreciation and travel. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Restructuring Costs Accounting for the timing and amount of termination benefits provided by the company to employees is determined based on whether: (a) the company has a substantive plan to provide such benefits, (b) the company has a written employment F-11 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) contract with the affected employees that includes a provision for such benefits, (c) the termination benefits are due to the occurrence of an event specified in an existing plan or agreement, or (d) the termination benefits are a one-time benefit. In certain circumstances, employee termination benefits may meet more than one of the characteristics listed above and therefore, may have individual elements that are subject to different accounting models. From time to time when executing a restructuring or exit plan, the company also incurs costs other than termination benefits, such as lease termination costs, that are not associated with or will not be incurred to generate revenues. These include costs that represent amounts under contractual obligations that exist prior to the restructuring plan communication date and will either continue after the restructuring plan is completed with no economic benefit or result in a penalty to cancel a contractual obligation. Such costs are recognized when incurred, which generally occurs at the contract termination or over the period from when a plan to abandon a leased facility is approved through the cease-use date but charges may continue over the remainder of the original contractual period. Income Taxes The company recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return. A valuation allowance is provided for tax assets that will more likely than not go unused. The financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the positions and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of money. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Except where the result would be antidilutive to net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., diluted earnings per share has been computed using the treasury stock method for outstanding stock options and restricted units. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consists principally of money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. As discussed below, prior to the third quarter of 2021 certain of the company's businesses utilized the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product or product line. In addition, the company has certain inventory that is subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the procurement of inventories, such as inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying statement of income. The components of inventories are as follows: December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Raw materials $ 2,405 $ 1,922 Work in process 660 676 Finished goods 2,569 2,453 Inventories $ 5,634 $ 5,051 Prior to the third quarter of 2021, certain of the company’s businesses utilized the LIFO method of accounting for inventories. During the third quarter of 2021, these businesses, which comprised approximately 5 % of consolidated inventories, changed from the LIFO method to the FIFO method. The company believes this change is preferable as it will provide a consistent, uniform costing method for all inventories across the company, better reflect the current value of inventories, and improve comparability with peers. Prior financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted due to immateriality. The cumulative pre-tax effect of this change in accounting principle of $ 33 million was recorded as an increase to inventories and a decrease to cost of product revenues in the third quarter of 2021. This change was recorded in the Laboratory Products and F-12 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Biopharma Services ($ 20 million) and Specialty Diagnostics ($ 13 million) segments. Reductions to cost of revenues as a result of the liquidation of LIFO inventories were nominal during 2020 and the first half of 2021. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The company generally provides for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the property as follows: buildings and improvements, 25 to 40 years; machinery and equipment (including software), 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements, the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying statement of income. Property, plant and equipment consists of the following: December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Land $ 454 $ 431 Buildings and improvements 3,153 2,575 Machinery, equipment and leasehold improvements 7,967 7,020 Construction in progress 2,695 2,567 Property, plant and equipment, at cost 14,269 12,593 Less: Accumulated depreciation and amortization 4,989 4,260 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 9,280 $ 8,333 Acquisition-related Intangible Assets Acquisition-related intangible assets include the costs of acquired customer relationships, product technology, tradenames, backlog and other specifically identifiable intangible assets, and are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 20 years. The company reviews these intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. When impairment indicators exist, the company determines whether the carrying value of its intangible assets exceeds the related undiscounted cash flows. In these situations, the carrying value is written down to fair value. In addition, the company has tradenames and in-process research and development that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate they may be impaired. The company may perform an optional qualitative assessment. If the company determines that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount, no additional testing is necessary. If not, or if the company bypasses the optional qualitative assessment, it writes the carrying value down to the fair value, if applicable. Acquisition-related intangible assets are as follows: Balance at December 31, 2022 Balance at December 31, 2021 (In millions) Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Definite lived: Customer relationships $ 21,792 $ ( 8,330 ) $ 13,462 $ 22,802 $ ( 7,792 ) $ 15,010 Product technology 5,882 ( 4,360 ) 1,522 6,041 ( 3,977 ) 2,064 Tradenames 1,635 ( 1,008 ) 627 1,722 ( 919 ) 803 Backlog 1,038 ( 442 ) 596 1,060 ( 59 ) 1,001 30,347 ( 14,140 ) 16,207 31,625 ( 12,747 ) 18,878 Indefinite lived: Tradenames 1,235 N/A 1,235 1,235 N/A 1,235 Acquisition-related intangible assets $ 31,582 $ ( 14,140 ) $ 17,442 $ 32,860 $ ( 12,747 ) $ 20,113 F-13 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The estimated future amortization expense of acquisition-related intangible assets with definite lives as of December 31, 2022 is as follows: (In millions) 2023 $ 2,279 2024 1,863 2025 1,582 2026 1,322 2027 1,296 2028 and thereafter 7,865 Estimated future amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets $ 16,207 Other Assets Other assets in the accompanying balance sheet include operating lease right-of-use assets, investments, deferred tax assets, pension assets, cash surrender value of life insurance, insurance recovery receivables related to product liability matters, certain intangible assets and other assets. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the company had $ 36 million and $ 33 million, respectively, of intangible assets not derived from acquisitions, net of accumulated amortization, which are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 20 years. Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and are not eligible for the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The company performs qualitative assessments to identify impairments of these investments. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the company had such investments with carrying amounts of $ 55 million and $ 22 million, respectively, and investments measured at NAV of $ 22 million and $ 16 million, respectively, which are included in other assets. Goodwill The company assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such events or circumstances generally include the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with one or more of the company’s reporting units. The company is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If the qualitative assessment results in a determination that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, the company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The company may bypass the qualitative assessment for the reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the goodwill impairment test. The company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer market multiples. The company would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (limited to the amount of goodwill). The company determined that no impairments existed in 2022, 2021 or 2020. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as follows: (In millions) Life Sciences Solutions Analytical Instruments Specialty Diagnostics Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services Total Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 8,590 $ 5,079 $ 3,370 $ 9,002 $ 26,041 Acquisitions 1,560 56 8 14,400 16,024 Currency translation ( 7 ) ( 92 ) ( 101 ) 59 ( 141 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 10,143 5,043 3,277 23,461 41,924 Acquisitions — 24 — — 24 Finalization of purchase price allocations for 2021 acquisitions 9 — — 168 177 Currency translation ( 6 ) ( 102 ) ( 186 ) ( 635 ) ( 929 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 10,146 $ 4,965 $ 3,091 $ 22,994 $ 41,196 F-14 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Certain liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at readily determinable fair values and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition. Currency Translation All assets and liabilities of the company’s subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated at period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Currency transaction gains are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were $ 62 million, $ 25 million and $ 24 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Derivative Contracts The company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings. The company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollars, Czech koruna and Swedish krona. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. Cash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Fair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings. Net investment hedges. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt, certain foreign-denominated payables, and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes, certain foreign-denominated payables, and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and certain foreign-denominated payables, and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. Government Assistance From time to time, the company receives assistance from various governmental agencies generally in the form of cash or non-income tax credits. These programs help offset the costs of certain research and development activities, facility construction and expansion efforts, or hiring objectives. When the company believes that it is probable that it will meet the conditions tied to the assistance, it offsets the associated expense in the consolidated income statement. Such amounts were not material to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. F-15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company’s estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic materially adversely affected certain of the company’s businesses in 2020, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the other three segments. The negative impacts significantly lessened in 2021 and 2022. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which may include inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, are uncertain and may require changes to estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2022, the FASB issued new guidance to require entities to disclose information about supplier finance programs. Among other things, the new guidance requires expanded disclosure about key program terms, payment terms, and amounts outstanding for obligations under these programs for each period presented. The company will adopt some aspects of this guidance in 2023 using a retrospective method and other aspects in 2024 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of arrangements of this nature entered into by the company In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance to require entities to disclose information about certain types of government assistance they receive, including cash grants and tax credits. Among other things, the new guidance requires expanded disclosure regarding the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the nature, amount, timing, and significant terms and conditions of transactions with a government arising from a grant or other forms of assistance accounted for under a contribution model. The company adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2022 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s disclosures; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future transactions of this nature entered into by the company. In October 2021, the FASB amended guidance to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. Generally, this new guidance will result in the company recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at the same amounts recorded by the acquiree. The company adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2021 retrospectively to all business combinations completed in the first three quarters of 2021 and prospectively to all future business combinations. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements for acquisitions that closed in 2021 and 2022; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in future business combinations. In July 2021, the FASB amended guidance to require lessors to classify leases as operating leases if they have certain variable lease payment structures and would have selling losses if they were classified as sales-type or direct financing leases. The company adopted the guidance in the third quarter of 2021 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. Among other things, the new guidance requires the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates to be reflected in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The company adopted this guidance in 2021 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future events or conditions that would be affected such as enacted changes in tax laws or rates. In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to require a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis, such as accounts receivable, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. During 2018 and 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 using a modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance reduced accounts receivable and retained earnings by $ 1 million on January 1, 2020. Note 2. Acquisitions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining F-16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) the businesses and the benefits that will be gained from the assembled workforces. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products and services; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products and services. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. 2023 On January 3, 2023, the company acquired, within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, The Binding Site Group, a U.K.-based provider of specialty diagnostic assays and instruments to improve the diagnosis and management of blood cancers and immune system disorders. The acquisition expands the segment’s portfolio with the addition of pioneering innovation in diagnostics and monitoring for multiple myeloma. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not expected to be tax deductible. The components of the purchase price and net assets acquired are as follows: (In billions) The Binding Site Purchase price Cash paid $ 2.42 Debt settled 0.31 Cash acquired ( 0.02 ) $ 2.71 Net assets acquired Definite-lived intangible assets $ 1.07 Goodwill 1.77 Net tangible assets 0.15 Deferred tax assets (liabilities) ( 0.28 ) $ 2.71 The weighted-average amortization period for definite-lived intangible assets is 17 years. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the acquisition of The Binding Site is based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and is subject to adjustment upon finalization, largely with respect to acquired intangible assets and the related deferred taxes. Measurements of these items inherently require significant estimates and assumptions. 2022 In 2022, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a U.S.-based developer of Fourier-transform infrared gas analysis technologies. 2021 On January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, the Belgium-based European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS.

The adjustments to the income statement recorded during 2022 were not material. The weighted-average amortization periods for definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2021 are 17 years for customer relationships, 11 years for product technology, 7 years for tradenames and 3 years for backlog. The weighted average amortization period for all definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2021 is 14 years. Unaudited Pro Forma Information The following unaudited pro forma information provides the effect of the company's 2021 acquisition of PPD as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2020: Year Ended December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Revenues $ 44,886 $ 36,887 Net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. $ 7,369 $ 5,361 The historical consolidated financial information of the company and PPD has been adjusted in the pro forma information to give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the acquisitions and related financing arrangements and are factually supportable. To reflect the acquisition of PPD as if it had occurred on January 1, 2020, the unaudited pro forma results include adjustments to reflect, among other things, the incremental intangible asset amortization to be incurred based on the preliminary values of each identifiable intangible asset and the interest expense from debt financings obtained to partially fund the cash consideration transferred. Pro forma adjustments were tax effected at the company's historical statutory rates in effect for the respective periods. The unaudited pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the combined results of operations that would have been realized had the acquisitions and related financings occurred on the aforementioned dates, nor are they meant to be indicative of any anticipated combined results of operations that the company will experience after the transaction. In addition, the amounts do not include any adjustments for actions that may be taken following the completion of the transaction, such as expected cost savings, operating synergies, or revenue enhancements that may be realized subsequent to the transaction. Pro forma net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2021, excludes $ 312 million of transaction costs, initial restructuring costs, and debt extinguishment costs directly attributable to the PPD acquisition that were included in the determination of net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. for that period. These items have reduced pro forma net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2020, by $ 197 million. The company’s results would not have been materially different from its pro forma results had the company’s other 2021 acquisitions occurred at the beginning of 2020. PPD’s revenues and losses attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. in 2021, subsequent to the acquisition date, were $ 378 million and $( 60 ) million, respectively. The loss includes non-recurring transaction and compensation costs. 2020 In 2020, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, a U.S.-based provider of a spectral dye platform for high-resolution biology applications which will extend the company’s existing tools for protein and cell analysis applications.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In 2020, other income/(expense) includes $ 81 million of financing costs for a terminated acquisition, primarily for loan commitment fees and entering into hedging contracts and $ 42 million reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive items related to a hedge arrangement (Note 14), offset in part by $ 10 million of net gains on investments. The company had a cash outlay of $ 51 million in 2020 associated with obtaining the loan commitments included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. Note 6. Stock-based Compensation Expense The company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others. These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, stock options or performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the company’s Board of Directors or, for certain non-officer grants, by the company’s employee equity committee, which consists of its chief executive officer. The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises and restricted unit vesting. Grants of stock options and restricted units generally provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option or unit holder’s employment, all options and service-based restricted unit awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment). Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier, and is primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Stock Options The company’s practice is to grant stock options at fair market value. Options vest over 3 - 5 years with terms of 7 - 10 years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions. Vesting of the option awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions. The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing the company’s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures. The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Expected stock price volatility 26 % 26 % 22 % Risk free interest rate 2.0 % 0.8 % 1.1 % Expected life of options (years) 4.7 4.3 4.3 Expected annual dividend 0.2 % 0.2 % 0.3 % The weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted during 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 135.07 , $ 123.97 and $ 61.19 , respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $ 336 million, $ 501 million and $ 457 million, respectively. The intrinsic value is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the option. F-23 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A summary of the company’s option activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is presented below: Shares (in millions) Weighted average exercise price Weighted average remaining contractual term (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value (in millions) Outstanding at December 31, 2021 6.0 $ 319.95 Granted 0.8 530.48 Exercised ( 0.9 ) 199.85 Canceled/expired ( 0.3 ) 503.76 Outstanding at December 31, 2022 5.6 $ 359.27 4.2 $ 1,125 Vested and unvested expected to vest at December 31, 2022 5.3 $ 351.97 4.7 $ 1,114 Exercisable at December 31, 2022 2.9 $ 251.44 2.8 $ 891 As of December 31, 2022, there was $ 228 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2026 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.4 years. Restricted Share/Unit Awards Awards of restricted units convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The awards generally vest over 3 - 4 years, assuming continued employment, with some exceptions. Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions. The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period. Recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to accrue dividend equivalents. The fair value of service- and performance-based restricted unit awards is determined based on the number of units granted and the market value of the company’s shares on the grant date. For awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the award. A summary of the company’s restricted unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is presented below: Units (in millions) Weighted average grant-date fair value Unvested at December 31, 2021 0.8 $ 425.39 Granted 0.4 520.83 Vested ( 0.4 ) 375.77 Forfeited ( 0.1 ) 510.37 Unvested at December 31, 2022 0.7 $ 495.39 The total fair value of shares vested during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 163 million, $ 151 million and $ 126 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, there was $ 200 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock unit awards. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2026 with a weighted average amortization period of 1.9 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plans Qualifying employees are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan sponsored by the company. Shares may be purchased under the program at 95 % of the fair market value at the end of the purchase period and the shares purchased are not subject to a holding period. Shares are purchased through payroll deductions of up to 10 % of each participating employee’s qualifying gross wages. The company issued 0.2 million, 0.1 million and 0.2 million shares, respectively, of its common stock in 2022, 2021 and 2020 under the employee stock purchase plan. F-24 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 7. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 401(k) Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans The company’s 401(k) savings and other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company’s eligible U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees. Contributions to the plans are made by both the employee and the company. Company contributions are based on the level of employee contributions. Company contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, the company charged to expense $ 402 million, $ 299 million and $ 254 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution plans. Defined Benefit Pension Plans Employees of a number of the company’s non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries. Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws. The company also maintains postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses where certain employees are eligible to participate. The liabilities and costs associated with the company’s postretirement healthcare programs are generally funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis and are not material for any period presented. The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive items, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive items is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost. When a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits. The company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the company made cash contributions of approximately $ 41 million, $ 34 million and $ 96 million, respectively. Contributions to the plans included in the following table are estimated at between $ 30 and $ 50 million for 2023. The following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations and plan assets of the company’s domestic and non-U.S. pension plans: Domestic pension benefits Non-U.S. pension benefits (In millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 995 $ 1,260 $ 1,016 $ 1,475 Change in projected benefit obligations Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 1,260 $ 1,302 $ 1,552 $ 1,486 Acquisitions — — 51 170 Service costs — — 34 27 Interest costs 27 23 20 11 Settlements — — ( 31 ) ( 7 ) Plan participants' contributions — — 9 6 Actuarial (gains) losses ( 210 ) 20 ( 447 ) ( 57 ) Benefits paid ( 82 ) ( 85 ) ( 19 ) ( 30 ) Currency translation and other — — ( 100 ) ( 54 ) Projected benefit obligation at end of year $ 995 $ 1,260 $ 1,069 $ 1,552 F-25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

For non-U.S. pension plans, actuarial gains experienced in 2022 were principally driven by increases in the weighted average discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation. For domestic pension plans, actuarial losses experienced in 2021 were driven by differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets for certain portions of plan benefits indexed to asset returns, which were partially offset by actuarial gains due to increases in the weighted average discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation differences. For non-U.S. pension plans, actuarial gains experienced in 2021 were principally driven by increases in the weighted average discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation. The actuarial assumptions used to compute the funded status for the plans are based upon information available as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and are as follows: Domestic pension benefits Non-U.S. pension benefits 2022 2021 2022 2021 Weighted average assumptions used to determine projected benefit obligations Discount rate for determining benefit obligation 5.01 % 2.70 % 3.91 % 1.45 % Interest crediting rate for cash balance plans 4.96 % 2.58 % 2.19 % 1.25 % Average rate of increase in employee compensation N/A N/A 2.78 % 2.73 % F-26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The actuarial assumptions used to compute the net periodic pension benefit cost (income) are based upon information available as of the beginning of the year, as presented in the following table: Domestic pension benefits Non-U.S. pension benefits 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Weighted average assumptions used to determine net benefit cost (income) Discount rate - service cost N/A N/A N/A 1.00 % 0.65 % 1.21 % Discount rate - interest cost 2.70 % 2.33 % 3.13 % 1.36 % 0.80 % 1.44 % Average rate of increase in employee compensation N/A N/A N/A 2.73 % 2.30 % 2.27 % Expected long-term rate of return on assets 4.75 % 4.25 % 5.00 % 2.33 % 2.02 % 2.33 % The discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations. The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan. The company utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot-rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance. In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks. Asset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements. The expected rate of compensation increase reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on historic salary increase experience and management’s expectations of future salary increases. The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company’s qualified and non-qualified pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows: Pension plans (In millions) 2022 2021 Pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets Projected benefit obligation $ 1,636 $ 2,010 Fair value of plan assets 1,296 1,521 The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company's qualified and non-qualified pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows: Pension plans (In millions) 2022 2021 Pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets Accumulated benefit obligation $ 1,583 $ 1,937 Fair value of plan assets 1,294 1,521 The measurement date used to determine benefit information is December 31 for all plan assets and benefit obligations.

Benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels, average years employed and average life spans, among other factors, and changes in any of these factors could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments. Estimated future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows: (In millions) Domestic pension benefits Non-U.S. pension benefits Expected benefit payments 2023 $ 85 $ 47 2024 81 48 2025 81 51 2026 80 55 2027 79 55 2028-2032 373 313 Domestic Pension Plan Assets The company’s overall objective is to manage the assets in a liability framework where investments are selected that are expected to have similar changes in fair value as the related liabilities will have upon changes in interest rates. The company invests in a portfolio of both return-seeking and liability-hedging assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth and to insulate the funded position from interest rate volatility. The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities. The target allocations for the investments are approximately 10 % to funds investing in U.S. equities, approximately 10 % to funds investing in international equities and approximately 80 % to funds investing in fixed income securities. The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments. Non-U.S. Pension Plan Assets The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S. The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans. Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies. When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers. The investments may include equity funds, fixed income funds, hedge funds, multi-asset funds, alternative investments and derivative funds with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 0 % - 25 % for equity funds, 30 % - 90 % for fixed income funds, 0 % - 35 % for multi-asset funds, and 0 % - 45 % for funds holding derivatives. The derivatives held by the funds are primarily interest rate swaps intended to match the movements in the plan liabilities. Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments. F-28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

During 2022, the company settled an IRS audit relating to the 2017 and 2018 tax years. The company recorded a $ 208 million net tax benefit primarily from this settlement and related impacts, which resulted in a decrease in the company’s unrecognized tax benefits of $ 658 million. The company recorded $ 49 million of charges for expired tax credits and other related components of the settlement. The company recorded a charge of $ 395 million to establish a valuation allowance against F-30 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) certain U.S. foreign tax credits which the company believes will more likely than not expire unutilized. The company also recorded $ 101 million of additional net unrecognized tax benefit liabilities related to other tax audits. During 2021, the company recorded a $ 188 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of an intra-entity transfer of assets. Also in 2021, the company recorded a $ 96 million income tax benefit related to a capital loss resulting from certain intra-entity transactions. During 2020, the company settled an IRS audit relating to the 2014, 2015, and 2016 tax years. The company recorded a $ 25 million net tax benefit primarily from this settlement and related impacts, which resulted in a decrease in the company’s unrecognized tax benefits of $ 378 million, of which $ 144 million was reclassified to income taxes payable. The company recorded $ 53 million of charges for expired tax credits and other related components of the settlement. The company recorded a charge of $ 156 million to establish a valuation allowance against certain U.S. foreign tax credits which the company believes will more likely than not expire unutilized. In 2020, the company recorded a $ 263 million income tax benefit related to a domestication transaction involving the transfer of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S., including interest expense of those subsidiaries. The company also recorded a valuation allowance of $ 212 million against the amount of interest expense that the company believes will more likely than not go unused. The foreign tax credits discussed below are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. In 2020, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $ 96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company generally receives a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees, or the vesting of restricted stock units held by employees, for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise. The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization of tax attributes. These excess tax benefits reduce the tax provision. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, the company's tax provision was reduced by $ 80 million, $ 124 million and $ 114 million, respectively, of such benefits. Net deferred tax asset (liability) in the accompanying balance sheet consists of the following: (In millions) 2022 2021 Deferred tax asset (liability) Depreciation and amortization $ ( 4,277 ) $ ( 4,687 ) Net operating loss and credit carryforwards 1,951 1,652 Reserves and accruals 140 162 Accrued compensation 259 318 Inventory basis difference 364 181 Deferred interest 445 295 Research and development and other capitalized costs 220 — Unrealized (gains) losses on hedging instruments ( 199 ) ( 33 ) Other, net 435 251 Deferred tax liabilities, net before valuation allowance ( 662 ) ( 1,861 ) Less: Valuation allowance 1,322 968 Deferred tax liabilities, net $ ( 1,984 ) $ ( 2,829 ) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not expire unutilized. At December 31, 2022, all of the company’s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets, primarily net operating losses and disallowed interest expense carryforward, for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense. F-31 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The changes in the valuation allowance are as follows: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Beginning balance $ 968 $ 933 $ 408 Additions (reductions) charged to income tax provision, net 344 24 514 Additions due to acquisitions 14 30 — Currency translation and other ( 4 ) ( 19 ) 11 Ending balance $ 1,322 $ 968 $ 933 At December 31, 2022, the company had net federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $ 68 million, $ 97 million and $ 1.16 billion, respectively. Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries. Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards, $ 33 million expire in the years 2023 through 2037, and the remainder do not expire. The state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2023 through 2042. Of the net non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $ 422 million expire in the years 2025 through 2042, and the remainder do not expire. At December 31, 2022, the company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $ 551 million and deferred interest carryforwards of $ 445 million. The foreign tax credit carryforwards will expire in the years 2025 through 2032 while deferred interest carryforwards do not expire. U.S. federal taxes have been recorded on approximately $ 29 billion of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2022. A provision has not been made for certain U.S. state income taxes or additional non-U.S. taxes that would be due when cash is repatriated to the U.S. as the company’s undistributed foreign earnings are intended to be reinvested outside of the U.S. indefinitely. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable due to the uncertainty in the manner in which these earnings will be distributed. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax cost. Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of December 31, 2022, the company had $ 0.57 billion of unrecognized tax benefits substantially all of which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Beginning balance $ 1,124 $ 1,091 $ 1,552 Additions due to acquisitions 15 26 — Additions for tax positions of current year 104 32 8 Additions for tax positions of prior years 24 60 — Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 659 ) ( 5 ) ( 296 ) Closure of tax years ( 4 ) ( 27 ) — Settlements ( 32 ) ( 53 ) ( 173 ) Ending balance $ 572 $ 1,124 $ 1,091 Substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits are classified as long-term liabilities. The company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months. During 2022, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 143 million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and decreased $ 610 million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions which included $ 658 million from the settlement of the IRS audit of the 2017 and 2018 tax years. The company also assumed $ 15 million of uncertain tax benefits as part of the acquisition of PPD. During 2021, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 80 million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and decreased $ 75 million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions. The company also assumed $ 26 million of uncertain tax benefits as part of the acquisition of PPD. During 2020, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits decreased $ 51 million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and $ 410 million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions which included $ 378 million from the settlement of the IRS audit of the 2014, 2015 and 2016 tax years. F-32 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 74 million and $ 59 million, respectively. The company conducts business globally and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to U.S. state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2012 and no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years before 2019.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) As of December 31, 2022, the annual repayment requirements for debt obligations are as follows: (In millions) Borrowings Finance Lease Liabilities 2023 $ 5,583 $ 11 2024 4,071 16 2025 2,298 12 2026 1,285 11 2027 1,999 10 2028 and thereafter 19,325 150 $ 34,561 $ 210 In addition to available borrowings under the company’s revolving credit agreements, discussed below, the company had unused lines of credit of $ 72 million as of December 31, 2022. These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates. Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility (the Facility) with a bank group that provides for up to $ 5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The Facility expires on January 7, 2027. The revolving credit agreement calls for interest at either a Term SOFR, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of December 31, 2022, there were $ 0.31 billion of outstanding borrowings under these programs. Senior Notes Interest is payable quarterly on the floating rate senior notes, annually on the euro-denominated fixed rate senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the fixed rate senior notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. Except for the euro-denominated floating rate senior notes, which may not be redeemed early, the floating rate senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part on or after their applicable call dates at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. The company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2022. In 2022 the company completed the full allocation of an amount equal to the net proceeds from the 0.000 % senior notes due 2025 to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, certain COVID-19 response projects. In 2022, the company redeemed all of its 3.650 % Senior Notes due 2025. In connection with the redemption, the company incurred $ 26 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in other income/(expense) on the accompanying statement of income. In 2021, the company redeemed some of its existing senior notes. In connection with these redemptions, the company incurred $ 767 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in other income/(expense) on the accompanying statement of income. Upon redemption of the senior notes, the company terminated the related fixed to floating rate interest rate F-35 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V. (Thermo Fisher International), a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued each of the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00 % Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00 % Senior Notes due 2025, the 0.80 % Senior Notes due 2030, the 1.125 % Senior Notes due 2033, the 1.625 % Senior Notes due 2041, and the 2.00 % Senior Notes due 2051 included in the table above (collectively, the “Euronotes”) in registered public offerings. The company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of Thermo Fisher International’s obligations under the Euronotes and all of Thermo Fisher International’s other debt securities, and no other subsidiary of the company will guarantee these obligations. Thermo Fisher International is a “finance subsidiary” as defined in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of the Exchange Act, with no assets or operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Euronotes and other debt securities issued by Thermo Fisher International from time to time. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Thermo Fisher International are consolidated in the financial statements of the company. Note 11. Leases As a lessee, the company leases certain logistics, office, and manufacturing facilities, as well as vehicles, copiers, and other equipment. These operating leases generally have remaining lease terms between 1 month and 30 years, and some include options to extend (generally for 1 to 10 years) or have options to terminate the arrangement within 1 year. The company has guaranteed the residual value of three leased operating facilities with lease terms ending in 2023, 2024 and 2025. The company has agreed with the lessor to comply with certain financial covenants consistent with its other debt arrangements (Note 10). The aggregate maximum guarantee under these three lease arrangements is $ 147 million. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities for these lease arrangements are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, but exclude any amounts for residual value guarantees.

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Obligations The company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. The aggregate amount of the company’s unconditional purchase obligations totaled $ 2.40 billion at December 31, 2022 and the majority of these obligations are expected to be settled during 2023. The Analytical Instruments segment recorded a charge to cost of product revenues for $ 108 million in 2020 related to an existing supply contract for components of electron microscopy instruments. The agreement requires the company to make future minimum purchases through 2025. The company developed and launched an alternative product beginning in 2020 and based on the expected demand for the internally developed product vs. the third-party product, the company does not expect to use all of the product it will be required to buy, resulting in a loss on the purchase commitment. Letters of Credit, Guarantees and Other Commitments Outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $ 297 million at December 31, 2022. Substantially all of these letters of credit and guarantees expire before 2040. Outstanding surety bonds and other guarantees totaled $ 84 million at December 31, 2022. The expiration of these bonds and guarantees ranges through 2024. The letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds principally secure performance obligations, and allow the holder to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit, bank guarantee or surety bond if the applicable business unit does not perform as contractually required. The company is a guarantor of pension plan obligations of a divested business. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2022 was $ 28 million. In connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with respect to those assumed liabilities. In the event a third-party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be liable to the third-party for such obligations. However, in such event, the company would be entitled to seek indemnification from the buyer. Indemnifications In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities). The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction. Where probable, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Generally, a F-37 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications. In connection with the company’s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties. When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility. As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement. The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position or results of operations. In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement. The company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions. Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including input from environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. At December 31, 2022 , the company’s total environmental liability was approximately $ 75 million. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies The company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The disputes and litigation matters include product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters. A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred. The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed below, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters The company is involved in various proceedings and litigation that arise from time to time in connection with product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters. The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company’s continuing operations at December 31, 2022, was F-38 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) approximately $ 223 million to $ 384 million on an undiscounted basis. The portion of these liabilities assumed in the 2006 merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present) value at the date of merger. The company’s accrual for all such matters in total, including the discounted liabilities, was $ 229 million at December 31, 2022 (or $ 232 million undiscounted). The accrual includes estimated defense costs and is gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $ 95 million at December 31, 2022 (or $ 98 million undiscounted) that are included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. The portion of these insurance assets assumed in the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at the date of merger. In addition to the above accrual, as of December 31, 2022, the company had a product liability accrual of $ 17 million (undiscounted) relating to divested businesses. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. Note 13.

Early in the first quarter of 2023, the company repurchased $ 3.00 billion of the company's common stock ( 5.2 million shares). Note 14. Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements The company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during 2022. The company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of investments in publicly traded securities, insurance contracts, investments in derivative contracts, mutual funds holding publicly traded securities and other investments in unit trusts held as assets to satisfy outstanding deferred compensation and retirement liabilities; and acquisition-related contingent consideration. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access. Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data. F-39 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company initially measures the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on amounts expected to be transferred (probability-weighted) discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs (such as likelihood of achieving production or revenue milestones, as well as changes in the fair values of the investments underlying a recapitalization investment portfolio), of the contingent consideration.

The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt, certain foreign-denominated payables, and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes, certain foreign-denominated payables, and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and certain foreign-denominated payables, and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. See Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information on the company’s risk management objectives and strategies. Cash Flow Hedge Arrangements In 2020 the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of debt offerings. Based on the company's conclusion that the debt offerings were probable, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the interest payments on the planned fixed-rate debt issues. The aggregate fair value of the terminated hedges, net of tax, has been classified as a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive items and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt issuances. The company had cash outlays aggregating $ 85 million in 2020 associated with termination of the arrangements, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. In late 2020, the company determined that the previously anticipated debt offerings were probable of not occurring and reclassified $ 42 million from accumulated other comprehensive items to other income/(expense). During 2021, in connection with the extinguishment of debt (Note 10), the company reclassified $ 65 million from accumulated other comprehensive items to other income/(expense).

Note 16. Restructuring and Other Costs Restructuring and other costs in 2022 primarily included impairment of long-lived assets and continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations. In 2022, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected less than 2 % of the company’s workforce. Restructuring and other costs in 2021 primarily included charges for impairments of an acquired technology asset and a tradename asset, and, to a lesser extent, compensation due to employees at acquired businesses on the date of acquisition. In 2021, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected less than 1 % of the company’s workforce. Restructuring and other costs in 2020 primarily included continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, and charges for the write-off of acquired technology. In 2020, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected approximately 1 % of the company’s workforce. As of February 23, 2023, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $ 60 million, primarily in 2023, and expects to identify additional actions in future periods which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred.

We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position. 11 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Business (continued) Resources Raw Materials Our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources. No single supplier is material, although for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design, certain materials components may be sourced from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such materials or components. Raw material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions. We employ many strategies, including the use of alternative materials, to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results. For a discussion of risks related to our supply chain and raw material and fuel prices, refer to “ Risk Factors ” in Part I, Item 1A. Patents, Licenses and Trademarks Patents are important in many aspects of our business. No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so important, however, that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest. Patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts. We protect some of our technology as trade secrets and, where appropriate, we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products. We also enter into license agreements with others to grant and/or receive rights to intellectual property rights. All trademarks, trade names, product names, graphics and logos of Thermo Fisher contained herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of Thermo Fisher or its subsidiaries, as applicable, in the United States and/or other countries. Solely for convenience, we may refer to trademarks in this Annual Report on Form 10-K without the ™ and ® symbols. Such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent permitted by law, our rights to our trademarks. To the extent other trademarks appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, they are the property of their respective owners. Seasonal Influences Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. Sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s flu season. Sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s airborne pollen allergens. Government Contracts Although the company transacts business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results. Competition The company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve. Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers, third-party distributors and service providers. Competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development. Our success primarily depends on the following factors: • technical performance and advances in technology that result in new products and improved price/performance ratios; • product differentiation, availability and reliability; • the depth of our capabilities; • our reputation among customers as a quality provider of products and services; • customer service and support; • active research and application-development programs; and • relative prices of our products and services. 12 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Business (continued) Government Regulation Environmental Regulations We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations. In addition to these federal laws and regulations, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes and have authority over these matters under state laws. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements. A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. Our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters. Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material. For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial measures. Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984 to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites, and are currently under the State’s Licensed Site Remediation Professional Program. As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site, and, in 2008, the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the USEPA to complete a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study. In 2018, the USEPA issued a Record of Decision, setting forth the scope of required remediation work at the site, which includes upgrading a water treatment plant to address constituents such as chlorinated organic compounds, 1,4-dioxane, and perfluorooctanoic acid/perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOA/PFOS). In 2020, the court approved a consent decree that requires the company and another responsible party to finance and perform the required remediation work with USEPA oversight. In 2011, our Life Technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the USEPA and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former Davis Landfill Superfund site in Smithfield, Rhode Island. After years of additional study, in September, 2020, USEPA revised its cleanup plan by selecting an interim remedial approach that includes groundwater treatment followed by additional monitoring of site conditions. Depending on the results of these treatment and monitoring activities over the next several years, USEPA anticipates selecting a final groundwater remedy for the site. In November 2021, the 2011 consent decree was amended to reflect the parties’ obligations to implement USEPA’s interim remedy. We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters. We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $65 million at December 31, 2021. These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled. We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur. As a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that the Company’s operations, products and services are subject to and other environmental contingencies, refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements – Commitments and Contingencies. 13 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Business (continued) Other Laws and Regulations Our operations, and some of the products and services we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the development, testing, approval, production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies. As Thermo Fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, no such laws or regulations have had a material impact on our operations. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenues associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could also result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. For a discussion of risks related to changes in governmental regulations, refer to “ Risk Factors ” in Part I, Item 1A. Human Capital The success of Thermo Fisher is fueled by colleagues who are highly engaged and feel empowered to achieve their goals. Everything we do starts with our Mission – to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. Our colleagues understand the role they play in fulfilling that Mission and that inspires them to bring their best to work each day. Our Mission is not only a differentiator for us externally, but a motivator for us internally. Our culture is rooted in our 4i Values of Integrity, Intensity, Innovation and Involvement. Within this framework, we strive to create a safe, fair and positive working environment for our colleagues around the world. We want our teams to feel they have a stake in our success, a voice in our direction and to be empowered to make a difference for the key stakeholders we serve. Every year, we conduct an Employee Involvement Survey to solicit direct feedback from our colleagues on what we’re doing well and where we need to improve. We then compile the feedback to measure our progress using three key indices: Leadership, Involvement and Inclusion. In 2021, 86 percent of our workforce completed the survey, and we saw marked improvement in each index and across nearly every survey question, despite the challenges of a sustained pandemic environment. Our continued focus on enhancing our culture helps position our company to be an even better place to work. We are committed to maintaining the strongest team in our industry, focusing on developing and retaining our colleagues, while leveraging our leadership to attract new colleagues to our company. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 130,000 colleagues globally, with an approximate regional distribution as follows: 67,000 based in the Americas, 20,000 in the Asia Pacific region, and nearly 42,000 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Diversity and Inclusion We recognize that the future aspirations outlined in our Vision for 2030, which serves as our long-term roadmap, will only be achievable if we have a culture that values diversity and inclusion. While diversity of gender and ethnicity are important – and we’re focused on continuously improving– for us, diversity of backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints is equally vital to our long-term success. When those differences are welcomed and supported, we create an inclusive workplace that unlocks the true benefits of diversity. Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) is not an initiative at Thermo Fisher. It’s woven into the fabric of our culture, and our colleagues are encouraged to openly share the wide range of perspectives they represent. We work together to create an inclusive culture where our colleagues feel they belong and are empowered to contribute, collaborate and innovate. Embracing individual differences is critical to our success. For example, Thermo Fisher was named as a Top 100 Female Friendly Employer by Forbes in 2021 as well as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality for the seventh consecutive year. Establishing this kind of environment is critical in empowering our colleagues so they can contribute their best ideas and bring their true selves to work each day. 14 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Business (continued) Our D&I focus is embedded in every stage of our colleague lifecycle – from recruiting to onboarding, training, development and longer-term career planning. We track our progress on our D&I strategic objectives through a core set of metrics that are reviewed during routine business operating mechanisms, including Quarterly Business Reviews, Human Resource Reviews, Board Reviews and through team dashboards that are shared each month with leaders across the company. This enables frequent, meaningful, data-driven discussions across our businesses and functions on a range of D&I factors, including gender and ethnic representation. This approach also ensures we consistently prioritize our opportunities to improve. We understand the critical role diversity plays in sustained business success, and our teams are empowered to ensure our workforce represents the customers we serve. Further, to provide additional transparency to our U.S. workforce demographics, in 2021, following our report submission to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, we disclosed our EEO-1 report on our website and we plan to continue to do so on an annual basis. We are committed to ensuring our colleagues have access to resources, awareness training and internal networks that offer support and guidance. Our D&I strategy is greatly enabled by our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which bring together individuals with similar interests to share experiences, learn from each other and collaborate to identify solutions to business challenges. Our ERGs reinforce that all colleagues can make a difference for our customers, for each other and for our company. As of December 31, 2021, we had 10 ERGs globally, with more than 220 local ERG chapters. Talent Development Our overarching goal from a talent perspective is to create opportunities for our colleagues to achieve their full potential and career aspirations here at Thermo Fisher. We are committed to creating an exceptional colleague experience from their first day throughout their career with us. We focus on the entire lifecycle of a colleague’s career, from their initial recruitment, to onboarding, through ongoing development and training to enhance their skills so they are in the best position to deliver on their goals and achieve their career aspirations. In today’s environment, we know talent is a key competitive advantage, and that building the strongest team in the industry is critical to our future. From our colleague referral program, summer internships, university relations, to our Graduate Leadership Development Program, we continue to build strong internal and external sourcing channels. Once on board, talent development at Thermo Fisher is a key organizational capability. We continue to make significant investments to support our colleagues along every step of their career journey to help support their success. Our talent development framework incorporates a multi-faceted approach, including formal and self-paced training, networking opportunities, on-the-job stretch learning, coaching, mentoring and manager training utilizing contemporary technology solutions to support the broad needs of our workforce. We provide multiple programs at all career levels, from online learning for all colleagues through Thermo Fisher University, to focused trainings for managers at various experience levels, to our Global Leadership Program for executives. We also support our colleagues’ career advancement through our tuition reimbursement program. In a company our size, we can also actively manage our talent through rotational opportunities across our businesses, functions and geographies that help our colleagues gain new experiences, share knowledge and broaden their skills. Our executives and leaders participate in frequent talent discussions as well as formal reviews, leveraging workforce data and predictive analytics to better anticipate the talent requirements of our business based on our growth opportunities and market demand. Thermo Fisher is dedicated to talent development to meet our evolving business needs and to provide our colleagues with opportunities for long and fulfilling careers. Our colleagues are passionate about our company, and their role in our success, and it’s our responsibility to help them reach their full potential. Total Rewards We offer a comprehensive total rewards package that we regularly evaluate and measure against established benchmarks to ensure its effectiveness in recruiting and retention, and to position Thermo Fisher as an employer of choice. In 2021, we reinvested an incremental $1 billion back into our global workforce in the form of pay, benefits, and workplace enhancements. Our health and wellness programs provide competitive, flexible programs that our global colleagues and their families can count on. For example, for U.S. colleagues, we offer a choice of comprehensive national medical, dental and vision plans; a wellness program, including valuable health incentive opportunities and tax-advantaged savings and spending accounts; as well as commuter benefits, employee assistance programs, optional group legal coverage, and company-paid disability, accident and life insurance. We also offer a company-paid proprietary program for cancer care called the Impact Program, which gives our colleagues and their families access to personalized support and direct lines of communication to experts in cancer genetics and genomics. Similar benefits are available in all countries around the world where we operate. 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Business (continued) We also invest in our colleagues’ financial health, helping them to grow and protect their savings, plan for the future and share in the success of the company they are helping to build. We deliver comprehensive rewards, including competitive base pay, and also provide a variety of incentive and equity programs that, by design, directly link the impact of colleague contributions to the company’s overall success. Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act In March 2021, the Russian Federal Security Service (the FSB) was designated as a blocked party under Executive Order 13382. During the quarter ended December 31, 2021, one of our Russian affiliates responded to an official inquiry from FSB in connection with the validity of certain product warranties on certain instruments sold by a reseller of the Russian affiliate to a health center based in Russia. This interaction did not result in any revenue or otherwise contribute to our net income for the quarter and all such dealings were legal and authorized by General License 1B issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. We expect our Russian affiliate to respond to similar regulatory inquiries in the future, as necessary and to the extent permitted by applicable U.S. sanctions laws and regulations.

Item 1A. Risk Factors Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in Item 1. Business under the caption “Forward-looking Statements”. Industry and Economic Risks Our growth would suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets would diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, continue to be unstable (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of: • reducing demand for some of our products; • increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays; • increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; • increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services; • causing supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; and • creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds. Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations. International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the “functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. As our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In 2021, currency translation had a favorable effect of $619 million on revenues due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services. Some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of global and local political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including issues of geopolitical relations, the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions and/or sovereign debt issues, and may have a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices. As a result of these and other factors, our strategy to grow in emerging markets may not be successful, and growth rates in these markets may not be sustainable. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: • interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; • changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions; • changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers; • tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs adopted by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods; 17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) • the impact of public health epidemics/pandemics on the global economy, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; • uncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable; • the imposition of governmental controls; • diverse data privacy and protection requirements; • supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; • negative consequences from changes in tax laws; • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; • differing labor regulations; • differing protection of intellectual property; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; • the effects of the U.K.'s departure from the E.U., known as Brexit; and • geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war. Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies. Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget. An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending. We are subject to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as COVID-19. The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty and worldwide economic disruption, resulting in an economic slowdown of potentially extended duration. COVID-19 has had an adverse impact on certain of our operations, supply chains and distribution systems, including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. National, state and local governments have implemented and may continue to implement safety precautions, including quarantines, border closures, increased border controls, travel restrictions, shelter in place orders and shutdowns and other measures. These measures may disrupt normal business operations and may have significant negative impacts on businesses and financial markets worldwide. The company has mobilized to support the COVID-19 response with products and services that help diagnose the virus as well as assisting customers to develop therapeutics and vaccines used to protect from the virus. Our ability to continue to manufacture products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our factory employees. The ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19. While we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our employees, these measures may not be successful, and we may be required to temporarily close facilities or take other measures. While we are staying in close communication with our sites, employees, customers and suppliers and acting to mitigate the impact of this dynamic and evolving situation, the duration and extent of the effect of COVID-19 on the company is not determinable. In addition, several of the company’s businesses have had an increase in revenues due to sales of products addressing diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. While these positive impacts are expected to continue into 2022, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing demand. Business Risks We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive. Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business 18 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenues and operating results would suffer. Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenues. It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including: • strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; • allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; • developing new applications for our technologies; • expanding our service offerings; • continuing key customer initiatives; • combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively; • finding new markets for our products; and • continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings. We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business. Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us. Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor. Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us. In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers. We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers. Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us. Integrating PPD into our business may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction may not be fully realized. The success of the PPD acquisition, including the realization of anticipated benefits and cost savings, depends, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate PPD into our business. The integration is a difficult, costly and time-consuming process. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or the disruption of our ongoing business or that the alignment of standards, controls, procedures and policies may adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, suppliers and employees or to fully achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction. The loss of key employees could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business in the markets in which PPD now operates, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the PPD acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and our business may be unable to grow as planned, which could materially impact our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations as well as adversely impact our share price. The integration process may also result in significant expenses and charges, both cash and noncash. Our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals, as well as disputes or litigation. Any 19 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company. Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business. Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $41.92 billion and $1.24 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $18.88 billion as of December 31, 2021. We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. We assess the realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. Operational Risks Our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials or components could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. Some of our businesses purchase certain materials from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues such as COVID-19, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies. A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business. As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We also rely on our information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners) and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as interacting with suppliers, selling our products and services, fulfilling orders and billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers, tracking customer activity, fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise conducting business). Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, phishing, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results. Our key business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. Any of the cyber-attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above, if significant, could materially interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches. If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed 20 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the U.S., individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation imposes significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data. Several countries, such as China and Russia, have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. We may have difficulty attracting and retaining a highly qualified workforce. Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical, clinical and management workforce in a highly competitive environment. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. We may face difficulty in attracting and retaining key talent for a number of reasons, including management changes or recruitment by competitors. Our ability to attract and retain key talent also depends in part on how well we maintain a strong workplace culture that is attractive to employees. We cannot ensure that we will be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary for our operations or that the loss of any personnel will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flows. Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel. While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs. Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe. We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected. Natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may disrupt our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, and could impact customer spending. We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk. An earthquake or other natural disaster such as a fire or hurricane or power shortages or outages could disrupt our operations or impair our critical systems. Any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control, such as strikes or other labor unrest, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing or warehouse facilities, or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict, or other events outside of our control, such as trade protectionism, strikes or other labor unrest, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact customer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally, which could also adversely impact our operating results. Increasing attention to environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business, financial results or stock price. Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and disclosures, including practices and disclosures related to climate change, diversity and inclusion and governance standards. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, lenders, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and disclosures and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. In addition, government organizations are enhancing or advancing legal and regulatory requirements specific to ESG matters. The heightened stakeholder focus on ESG issues related to our business requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving laws, regulations, standards and expectations and the associated reporting requirements. A failure to adequately meet stakeholder expectations may result in noncompliance, the loss of business, reputational impacts, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers and an 21 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) inability to attract and retain top talent. In addition, our adoption of certain standards or mandated compliance to certain requirements could necessitate additional investments that could impact our profitability. Legal, Quality and Regulatory Risks Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, we manufacture pharmaceuticals and many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (the FDA) regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenues associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. Our pharma services offerings are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers, our business could suffer. Our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements. Our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our quality management strategy and systems, and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. A failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products. In each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether. In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such failure could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenues, reimbursement to customers for lost drug product, registered intermediates, registered starting materials, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, other customer claims, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. Production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high. If problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market, we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of which could be significant. We are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. We may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers. Additionally, products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims. In addition, patients involved in our clinical services trials conducted by our clinical development services business or taking drugs approved on the basis of those trials may also bring personal injury claims against us. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all. 22 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies. We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS), the European Medicines Agency (the EMA), the EU member states and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale. The manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices, and our pharma and clinical development services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients or personal injury, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. We are the sole manufacturer of a number of pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers' ability to provide products to their customers. We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We have internal controls and compliance systems to protect the company against acts committed by employees, agents or businesses that we acquire that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy, but these controls and systems may not be sufficient to prevent every such wrongful act. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies which we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the U.S. and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not 23 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may not adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to Financial Profile Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Our existing and future indebtedness may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities and negatively impact our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $34.87 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $5.00 billion (as of January 7. 2022) of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (the Facility). We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain a financial ratio, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities and create liens. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5:1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as the impact of foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and 24 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The company owns and leases office, engineering, laboratory, production and warehouse space throughout the world. Item 3.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements , which begin on page F-1 of this report. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for 2019 is included in Item 7 of the company’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company refers to various amounts or measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to their most directly comparable amount or measure under the section “ N on-GAAP M easures ” later in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” Overview Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics and therapies, and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. The company’s operations fall into four segments (Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services. Financial Highlights - 2021 Compared With 2020 (Dollars in millions except per share amounts) 2021 2020 Change Revenues $ 39,211 $ 32,218 22 % GAAP operating income $ 10,028 $ 7,794 29 % GAAP operating income margin 25.6 % 24.2 % 1.4 pt Adjusted operating income (non-GAAP measure) $ 12,138 $ 9,556 27 % Adjusted operating income margin (non-GAAP measure) 31.0 % 29.7 % 1.3 pt GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. $ 19.46 $ 15.96 22 % Adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP measure) $ 25.13 $ 19.56 28 % Organic Revenue Growth Revenue growth 22 % Impact of acquisitions 3 % Impact of currency translation 2 % Organic revenue growth* (non-GAAP measure) 17 % * Results may not sum due to rounding. The company mobilized in early 2020 to support the COVID-19 pandemic response with products and services that help analyze, diagnose and protect from the virus. However, as a result of the pandemic’s impact on various markets, the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the 2020 results of the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the company’s other three segments. The negative impact significantly lessened in 2021, but could worsen in 2022 dependent on the success of global efforts to control and unwind from the pandemic and economic activity ramping up. During 2021, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business continued to support COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. The biosciences and bioproduction businesses also expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they rapidly expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, through our pharma services business, we provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2022, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Sales of products related to COVID-19 response were $9.23 billion and $6.63 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Conditions were strong in each of the company’s end markets during 2021. Revenues were particularly strong in pharma and biotech driven by strong market dynamics and the company’s role in supporting customers across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. Customers in the academic and 26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview (continued) government market increased demand as a result of positive funding trends around the globe and a return to pre-pandemic levels of activity. Customer activity in the industrial and applied market returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2021. Revenues from customers in the diagnostics and healthcare market were driven by growth in COVID-19 testing-related products as the company continued to support the societal response to the pandemic. Sales growth was strong across all geographic regions during 2021. The company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars: • Developing high-impact, innovative new products, • Leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets, and • Delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. GAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin increased in 2021 due primarily to profit on higher sales and sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments to support the company’s near and long-term growth. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Productivity improvements are calculated net of inflationary cost increases. Notable Recent Acquisitions On January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, the Belgium-based European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS for $830 million in net cash consideration. The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers. The acquisition expands the segment’s capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies. On February 25, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Mesa Biotech, Inc., a U.S.-based molecular diagnostic company, for $407 million in net cash consideration and contingent consideration with an initial fair value of $65 million due upon the completion of certain milestones. Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a PCR based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19. The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care. On September 30, 2021, the company assumed operating responsibility, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, of a new state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland from CSL Limited to perform pharma services for CSL with capacity to serve other customers as well. The company expects to make fixed lease payments aggregating to $555 million (excluding renewals) from 2021 to 2041, with additional amounts dependent on the extent of revenues from customers of the facility other than CSL. On December 8, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, PPD, Inc., a U.S.-based global provider of clinical research services to the pharma and biotech industry, for $15.99 billion in net cash consideration and $43 million of equity awards exchanged. The addition of PPD’s clinical research services enhances our offering to biotech and pharma customers by enabling them to accelerate innovation and increase their productivity within the drug development process. In 2020, PPD generated revenues of $4.68 billion. On December 30, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, PeproTech, Inc., a U.S. based developer and manufacturer of recombinant proteins, for $1.86 billion in net cash consideration. PeproTech provides bioscience reagents known as recombinant proteins, including cytokines and growth factors. The acquisition expands the segment’s bioscience offerings. Results of Operations The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits as defined in Note 4. Accordingly, the following segment data are reported on this basis. 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

See additional discussion under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. GAAP other income/(expense) and adjusted other income/(expense) includes currency transaction gains and losses on non-operating monetary assets and liabilities and net periodic pension benefit cost/income, excluding the service cost component. GAAP other income/(expense) in 2021 also includes $767 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 10) and $36 million of financing costs associated with obtaining bridge financing commitments in connection with the agreement to acquire PPD (Note 2), offset in part by $66 million of net gains on investments. GAAP other income/(expense) in 2020 includes $81 million of financing costs for a terminated acquisition, primarily for loan commitment fees and entering into hedging contracts and $42 million of expense reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive items related to a hedge arrangement (Note 14), offset in part by $10 million of net gains on investments. The company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher profits at different marginal rates, offset in part by the benefits of our tax planning initiatives. The company’s 2021 GAAP and adjusted tax rates were also impacted by income tax benefits on intra-entity transactions totaling $284 million. In 2020, the company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates were impacted by foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense; a net income tax benefit of $51 million from a domestication transaction involving the transfer of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S.; and a $47 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements. Additionally, the 2020 GAAP tax rate included a $27 million tax benefit from tax audit settlements. The effective tax rate in both 2021 and 2020 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $2.18 billion and $1.32 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The company expects its GAAP effective tax rate in 2022 will be between 9% and 11% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. The company expects its adjusted tax rate will be approximately 13% in 2022. 29 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources The company’s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets. The company deploys its capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends. December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,477 $ 10,325 Total debt 34,870 21,735 Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions, capacity expansion, and repayment of third-party foreign debt by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. As of December 31, 2021, the company’s short-term debt totaled $2.54 billion. On January 7, 2022, the company replaced its prior credit facility with a new revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 10). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $4 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. (In millions) 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,312 $ 8,289 Net cash used in investing activities (21,932) (1,510) Net cash provided by financing activities 6,581 959 Free cash flow (non-GAAP measure) 6,809 6,823 During 2021, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $204 million and $1.07 billion, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $479 million. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $724 million primarily due to the timing of tax and incentive compensation payments. Cash payments for income taxes were $2.18 billion during 2021. During 2020, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $1.30 billion and $508 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities provided cash of $1.45 billion primarily due to the timing of incentive compensation payments and, to a lesser extent, customer billings. Cash payments for income taxes were $1.32 billion during 2020. During 2021, acquisitions used cash of $19.40 billion. The company's investing activities also included the purchase of $2.52 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. During 2020, the company’s investing activities were principally for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. 30 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2021, issuance of senior notes provided $18.14 billion of cash. A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $2.51 billion. Repayment of debt used cash of $11.74 billion, including $4.30 billion to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition of PPD. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $395 million in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (3.3 million shares). At February 24, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. As discussed in Note 10, in the first quarter of 2022 the company redeemed its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025 for a total cash outlay of $375 million. During 2020, issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $710 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company’s common stock (4.5 million shares) and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends. The company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion. In addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12). The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading “ Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters, ” in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company’s short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods. We report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company’s core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable: • Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs. • Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs. • Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. • The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years. Exclusion of 31 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Non-GAAP Measures (continued) the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. • The tax impacts of the above items and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as changes in deferred taxes from enacted tax rate changes), the latter of which we exclude because they are outside of our normal operations and difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We report free cash flow, which is operating cash flow, excluding net capital expenditures to provide a view of the continuing operations’ ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. The company uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. The non-GAAP financial measures of Thermo Fisher Scientific’s results of operations and cash flows included in this Form 10-K are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for Thermo Fisher Scientific’s results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth within the “Overview” and “Results of Operations” sections and below.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquisition-related measurements and income taxes. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: Acquisition-related Measurements Business Combinations The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses, which include estimates of customer attrition and technology obsolesce rates. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. See Note 2 for additional information about our recent business combinations. 33 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $41.92 billion and $1.24 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021 (see Note 1 for additional information). Estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and other factors. For the goodwill impairment tests, the company considers (i) peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and (ii) estimated weighted average costs of capital. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for all of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indications of fair value based on projections of cash flows, which increased over the prior year projections at higher rates than the increases in carrying values, and on peer revenues, earnings trading multiples and discount rates, which were relatively consistent with the prior year, were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2021, the date of the company’s annual impairment testing. There were no interim impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2021. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. Definite-lived Intangible Assets Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $18.88 billion at December 31, 2021 (see Note 1 for additional information). The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. The company recorded impairments of $0.12 billion in 2021 (see Note 16 for additional information). Contingent Consideration The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, which were initially exchanged for control of businesses or assumed from acquired businesses, was $0.32 billion at December 31, 2021. At each reporting period, the fair value of contingent consideration is determined using either discounted cash flow analyses, Monte Carlo simulations, or fair values of an underlying recapitalization investment portfolio. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes in estimates of revenue or operating results or in the timing or likelihood of achieving milestones, as well as changes in the fair values of the investments underlying the recapitalization investment portfolio. These changes resulted in (benefits)/charges of $(0.05) billion during 2021 (see Note 14 for additional information). Income Taxes Unrecognized Tax Benefits In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. The company’s liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled $1.12 billion at December 31, 2021 (see Note 8 for additional information). 34 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the company to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income. Valuation Allowances The company estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which the company has been able to determine that its deferred tax assets will be realized, that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $0.97 billion at December 31, 2021 (see Note 8 for additional information). Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. Undistributed Earnings The company has not provided U.S. state income taxes or additional non-U.S. taxes on certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings, as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies (see Note 8 for additional information). These business plans and tax strategies consider: short-term and long-term forecasts and budgets of the U.S. parent and non-U.S. subsidiaries; working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated; the company’s past practices regarding non-U.S. subsidiary dividends; sources of financing by the U.S. parent, such as issuing debt or equity; and uses of cash by the U.S. parent that are more discretionary in nature, such as business combinations and share repurchase programs. However, should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its U.S. subsidiaries, including cash maintained by these non-U.S. subsidiaries, the company would recognize additional tax liabilities. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional U.S. state income tax and non-U.S. tax liabilities that the company would incur. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax costs. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “ Recent Accounting Pronouncements ” in Note 1. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Swiss franc, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Czech koruna, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollars. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2021, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s 35 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2021 was $36.05 billion (Note 14). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2021 would increase by approximately $2.51 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2021 would decrease by approximately $2.52 billion. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. In 2021, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variable-rate debt would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $6 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Canadian dollars, Norwegian kroner and Danish kroner. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2021 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of approximately $1.23 billion. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2021 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an additional unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $71 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2021 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $71 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2021 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $27 million on the company’s net income. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data This data is submitted as a separate section to this report. See Item 15 “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. ” Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 36 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The company’s management, including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The company’s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, the company’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, excluded PPD, Inc., Mesa Biotech, Inc. and PeproTech, Inc., which were acquired by the company in 2021 in separate purchase business combinations. These entities, whose total assets and total revenues were excluded from the company’s assessment, represented approximately 5% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Based upon Securities and Exchange Commission staff guidance, companies are allowed to exclude certain acquisitions from their assessments of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired companies. The company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, as stated in their report that appears on page F-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of redeemable noncontrolling interest and equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and F-2 significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded PPD, Inc., Mesa Biotech, Inc. and PeproTech, Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2021. We have also excluded PPD, Inc., Mesa Biotech, Inc. and PeproTech, Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. PPD, Inc., Mesa Biotech, Inc. and PeproTech, Inc. are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting collectively represent approximately 5% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Income taxes As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,109 million. The Company has F-3 deferred tax liabilities, net, of $2,829 million (including a valuation allowance of $968 million) and unrecognized tax benefits of $1,124 million as of December 31, 2021. As disclosed by management, the Company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires management to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and to use estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Management assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, management has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Management estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which management has been able to determine that the Company’s deferred tax assets will be realized, that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, management reverses the related valuation allowance. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to income taxes is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when interpreting the numerous and complex tax laws and regulations as it relates to determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the valuation allowance, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the valuation allowance, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the valuation allowance, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the accuracy of the provision for income taxes, including the rate reconciliation and permanent and temporary differences, (ii) evaluating whether the data utilized in the calculations of the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were appropriate and consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit, (iii) evaluating management’s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis, (iv) evaluating the identification of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and the reasonableness of the more likely than not determination in consideration of court decisions, legislative actions, statutes of limitations, and developments in tax examinations by jurisdiction, (v) testing the calculation of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits by jurisdiction, including estimates of the amount of income tax benefit expected to be sustained, and (vi) evaluating the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgments and estimates related to the application of foreign and domestic tax laws and regulations. F-4 Acquisition of PPD, Inc. - Valuation of Customer Relationships Intangible Assets As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, on December 8, 2021, the Company acquired PPD, Inc. for $15.99 billion in net cash consideration and $43 million of equity awards exchanged, which resulted in $6,264 million of customer relationships intangible assets being recorded. As disclosed by management, assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of the customer relationships intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Management estimates the fair value of acquisition-related customer relationships intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from the customer relationships of PPD, Inc., which include estimates of customer attrition rates. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the date of the acquisition. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the acquired customer relationships intangible assets from the acquisition of PPD, Inc. is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the fair value of the acquired customer relationships intangible assets, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to projections of cash flows and discount rates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the customer relationships intangible assets. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement, (ii) testing management’s process for determining the fair values of the acquired customer relationships intangible assets, (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilizing discounted projected cash flows, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the discounted projected cash flows, and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to projections of cash flows and discount rates. Evaluating management’s significant assumption related to projections of cash flows involved evaluating whether the significant assumption used by management was reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of PPD, Inc., (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether the significant assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilizing discounted projected cash flows and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate significant assumption. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 24, 2022 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

F-10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics and therapies, and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The company accounts for investments in businesses using the equity method when it has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control (generally between 20% and 50% ownership), is not the primary beneficiary and has not elected the fair value option. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the company had such investments with carrying amounts of $ 576 million and $ 32 million, respectively. The company has elected the fair value option of accounting for certain of its investments with readily determinable fair values that would otherwise be accounted for under the equity method. At December 31, 2021, the fair value of such investments was $ 217 million. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest The company owns 60 % of its consolidated subsidiary PPD-SNBL K.K. The 40 % ownership interest held by a third party is classified as a redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheet due to certain put options under which the third party may require the company to purchase the remaining ownership interest at its pre-acquisition fair value. Presentation Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. Revenue Recognition Consumables revenues consist of single-use products and are recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Instruments revenues typically consist of longer-lived assets that, for the substantial majority of sales, are recognized at a point in time in a manner similar to consumables. Service revenues (primarily clinical research, pharmaceutical, and instrument and enterprise services) are recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of such services. For revenues recognized over time, the company generally uses costs accumulated relative to total estimated costs to measure progress as this method approximates satisfaction of the performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the consideration to which it expects to be entitled (i.e., the transaction price) to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognizes the related revenues when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. The company exercises judgment in determining the timing of revenue by analyzing the point in time or the period over which the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the asset. The company immediately expenses contract costs that would otherwise be capitalized and amortized over a period of less than one year. Changes to the scope of services contracts generally also include changes in the transaction price. Typically, these contract modifications are not distinct from existing services provided under the contract, and result in cumulative adjustments to revenue on the modification date. Payments from customers for most instruments and consumables are typically due in a fixed number of days after shipment or delivery of the product. Service arrangements commonly call for payments in advance of performing the work (e.g., extended service contracts), upon completion of the service (e.g., pharmaceutical services) or a mix of both. Some arrangements include variable amounts of consideration that arise from discounts, rebates, and other programs and practices. In such arrangements, the company estimates the amount by which to reduce the stated contract amount to reflect the transaction price. The company records reimbursement for third-party pass-through and out-of-pocket costs as revenues and the related expenses as costs of revenues. Contract-related Balances Accounts receivable include unconditional rights to consideration from customers, which generally represent billings that do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimates of expected losses resulting from F-11 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on history of similarly aged receivables, the creditworthiness of the customer, reasons for delinquency, current economic conditions, expectations associated with future events and circumstances where reasonable and supportable forecasts are available and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. Receivables from academic and government customers as well as large, well-capitalized commercial customers have historically experienced less collectability risk. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers. Contract assets include revenues recognized in advance of billings where the company’s right to bill includes something other than the passage of time. Such amounts are recorded net of estimated losses resulting from the inability to invoice customers, which is primarily due to risk associated with the company’s performance. Contract assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the amount of time expected to lapse until the company's right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities include billings in excess of revenues recognized, such as those resulting from customer advances and deposits and unearned revenues on service contracts. Contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the periods over which remaining performance obligations are expected to be transferred to customers. Contract assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheet if they arise from different performance obligations in the same contract. Warranty Obligations The company provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties, primarily from historical information, in cost of product revenues at the time product revenues are recognized. The liability for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. Extended warranty agreements are considered service contracts, which are discussed above. Costs of service contracts are recognized as incurred. Leases Operating leases that have commenced are included in other assets, other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases that have commenced are included in property, plant and equipment, net, current maturities of long-term obligations and long-term obligations in the consolidated balance sheet. Classification of lease liabilities as either current or noncurrent is based on the expected timing of payments due under the company’s obligations. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The company recognizes operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense includes depreciation, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the leased asset, and an immaterial amount of interest expense. Because most of the company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the company estimates incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. Lease terms include the effect of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As a lessee, the company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Research and Development The company conducts research and development activities to increase its depth of capabilities in technologies, software and services. Research and development costs include employee compensation and benefits, consultants, facilities related costs, material costs, depreciation and travel. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Restructuring Costs Accounting for the timing and amount of termination benefits provided by the company to employees is determined based on whether: (a) the company has a substantive plan to provide such benefits, (b) the company has a written employment contract with the affected employees that includes a provision for such benefits, (c) the termination benefits are due to the occurrence of an event specified in an existing plan or agreement, or (d) the termination benefits are a one-time benefit. In certain circumstances, employee termination benefits may meet more than one of the characteristics listed above and therefore, may have individual elements that are subject to different accounting models. F-12 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) From time to time when executing a restructuring or exit plan, the company also incurs costs other than termination benefits, such as lease termination costs, that are not associated with or will not be incurred to generate revenues. These include costs that represent amounts under contractual obligations that exist prior to the restructuring plan communication date and will either continue after the restructuring plan is completed with no economic benefit or result in a penalty to cancel a contractual obligation. Such costs are recognized when incurred, which generally occurs at the contract termination or over the period from when a plan to abandon a leased facility is approved through the cease-use date but charges may continue over the remainder of the original contractual period. Income Taxes The company recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return. A valuation allowance is provided for tax assets that will more likely than not go unused. The financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the positions and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of money. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Except where the result would be antidilutive to net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., diluted earnings per share has been computed using the treasury stock method for outstanding stock options and restricted units. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consists principally of money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. As discussed below, prior to the third quarter of 2021 certain of the company's businesses utilized the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product or product line. In addition, the company has certain inventory that is subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the procurement of inventories, such as inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying statement of income. The components of inventories are as follows: December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Raw materials $ 1,922 $ 1,305 Work in process 676 540 Finished goods 2,453 2,184 Inventories $ 5,051 $ 4,029 Prior to the third quarter of 2021, certain of the company’s businesses utilized the LIFO method of accounting for inventories. During the third quarter of 2021, these businesses, which comprised approximately 5 % of consolidated inventories, changed from the LIFO method to the FIFO method. The company believes this change is preferable as it will provide a consistent, uniform costing method for all inventories across the company, better reflect the current value of inventories, and improve comparability with peers. Prior financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted due to immateriality. The cumulative pre-tax effect of this change in accounting principle of $ 33 million was recorded as an increase to inventories and a decrease to cost of product revenues in the third quarter of 2021. This change was recorded in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services ($ 20 million) and Specialty Diagnostics ($ 13 million) segments. The value of inventories maintained using the LIFO method was $ 274 million at December 31, 2020, which was below estimated replacement cost by $ 49 million. Reductions to cost of revenues as a result of the liquidation of LIFO inventories were nominal during 2019, 2020 and the first half of 2021. F-13 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The company generally provides for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the property as follows: buildings and improvements, 25 to 40 years; machinery and equipment (including software), 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements, the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying statement of income. Property, plant and equipment consists of the following: December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Land $ 431 $ 410 Buildings and improvements 2,575 2,192 Machinery, equipment and leasehold improvements 9,587 6,975 Property, plant and equipment, at cost 12,593 9,577 Less: Accumulated depreciation and amortization 4,260 3,665 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 8,333 $ 5,912 Acquisition-related Intangible Assets Acquisition-related intangible assets include the costs of acquired customer relationships, product technology, tradenames, backlog and other specifically identifiable intangible assets, and are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 20 years. The company reviews these intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. When impairment indicators exist, the company determines whether the carrying value of its intangible assets exceeds the related undiscounted cash flows. In these situations, the carrying value is written down to fair value. In addition, the company has tradenames and in-process research and development that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate they may be impaired. The company may perform an optional qualitative assessment. If the company determines that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount, no additional testing is necessary. If not, or if the company bypasses the optional qualitative assessment, it writes the carrying value down to the fair value, if applicable. Acquisition-related intangible assets are as follows: Balance at December 31, 2021 Balance at December 31, 2020 (In millions) Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Definite lived: Customer relationships $ 22,802 $ ( 7,792 ) $ 15,010 $ 16,593 $ ( 7,450 ) $ 9,143 Product technology 6,041 ( 3,977 ) 2,064 5,523 ( 3,532 ) 1,991 Tradenames 1,722 ( 919 ) 803 1,213 ( 897 ) 316 Backlog 1,060 ( 59 ) 1,001 — — — 31,625 ( 12,747 ) 18,878 23,329 ( 11,879 ) 11,450 Indefinite lived: Tradenames 1,235 N/A 1,235 1,235 N/A 1,235 Acquisition-related intangible assets $ 32,860 $ ( 12,747 ) $ 20,113 $ 24,564 $ ( 11,879 ) $ 12,685 F-14 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The estimated future amortization expense of acquisition-related intangible assets with definite lives is as follows: (In millions) 2022 $ 2,489 2023 2,358 2024 1,992 2025 1,669 2026 1,392 2027 and thereafter 8,978 Estimated future amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets $ 18,878 Other Assets Other assets in the accompanying balance sheet include operating lease right-of-use assets, investments, deferred tax assets, pension assets, cash surrender value of life insurance, insurance recovery receivables related to product liability matters, certain intangible assets and other assets. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the company had $ 33 million and $ 43 million, respectively, of intangible assets not derived from acquisitions, net of accumulated amortization, which are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 20 years. Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and are not eligible for the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The company performs qualitative assessments to identify impairments of these investments. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the company had such investments with carrying amounts of $ 22 million and $ 28 million, respectively, and investments measured at NAV of $ 16 million and $ 0 million , respectively, which are included in other assets. Goodwill The company assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such events or circumstances generally include the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with one or more of the company’s reporting units. The company is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If the qualitative assessment results in a determination that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, the company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The company may bypass the qualitative assessment for the reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the goodwill impairment test. The company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer market multiples. The company would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (limited to the amount of goodwill). The company determined that no impairments existed in 2021, 2020 or 2019. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as follows: (In millions) Life Sciences Solutions Analytical Instruments Specialty Diagnostics Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services Total Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 8,544 $ 4,928 $ 3,184 $ 9,058 $ 25,714 Acquisition 35 — — — 35 Currency translation 11 151 186 ( 56 ) 292 Balance at December 31, 2020 8,590 5,079 3,370 9,002 26,041 Acquisitions 1,560 56 8 14,400 16,024 Currency translation ( 7 ) ( 92 ) ( 101 ) 59 ( 141 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 10,143 $ 5,043 $ 3,277 $ 23,461 $ 41,924 F-15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Certain liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at readily determinable fair values and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition. Currency Translation All assets and liabilities of the company’s subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated at period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Currency transaction gains are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were $ 25 million, $ 24 million and $ 52 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Derivative Contracts The company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings. The company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Swiss franc, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Czech koruna, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollars. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. Cash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Fair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings. Net investment hedges. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company’s estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic materially adversely affected certain of the company’s businesses in 2020, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the other three segments. The negative impacts significantly lessened in 2021. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which F-16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance to require entities to disclose information about certain types of government assistance they receive, including cash grants and tax credits. Among other things, the new guidance requires expanded disclosure regarding the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the nature, amount, timing, and significant terms and conditions of transactions with a government arising from a grant or other forms of assistance accounted for under a contribution model. The company will adopt this guidance in 2022 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures; however, the impact will be dependent on the extent of transactions of this nature entered into by the company in periods subsequent to the date of adoption. In October 2021, the FASB amended guidance to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. Generally, this new guidance will result in the company recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at the same amounts recorded by the acquiree. The company adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2021 retrospectively to all business combinations completed in the first three quarters of 2021 and prospectively to all future business combinations. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements for acquisitions that closed in 2021; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in future business combinations. In July 2021, the FASB amended guidance to require lessors to classify leases as operating leases if they have certain variable lease payment structures and would have selling losses if they were classified as sales-type or direct financing leases. The company adopted the guidance in the third quarter of 2021 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify the interaction of the accounting for certain equity securities, equity method investments, and certain forward contracts and purchased options. Among other things, the new guidance clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying measurement principles for certain equity securities immediately before applying or discontinuing the equity method. The company adopted this guidance in 2020 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. Among other things, the new guidance requires the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates to be reflected in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The company adopted this guidance in 2021 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future events or conditions that would be affected such as enacted changes in tax laws or rates. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 using a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 with some items requiring a prospective method and others requiring a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to require a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis, such as accounts receivable, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. During 2018 and 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 using a modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance reduced accounts receivable and retained earnings by $ 1 million on January 1, 2020. In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities, initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments, with corresponding right-of-use assets. The new guidance also sets forth new disclosure requirements related to leases. During 2017 - 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company adopted this guidance in January 2019. The company elected to adopt the guidance using a modified retrospective method, by applying the transition approach as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Comparative periods have not been restated. As permitted upon transition, the company did not reassess whether any expired or F-17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) existing contracts were or contained embedded leases, the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, initial direct costs for any leases, or whether land easements met the definition of a lease if they were not accounted for as leases under the prior guidance. The adoption of this guidance increased retained earnings by $ 4 million on January 1, 2019. Note 2. Acquisitions and Disposition The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses and the benefits that will be gained from the assembled workforce. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. 2021 On January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, the Belgium-based European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS for $ 830 million in net cash consideration. The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers. The acquisition expands the segment’s capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not tax deductible. On February 25, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Mesa Biotech, Inc., a U.S.-based molecular diagnostic company, for $ 407 million in net cash consideration and contingent consideration with an initial fair value of $ 65 million due upon the completion of certain milestones. Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19. The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not tax deductible. On September 30, 2021, the company assumed operating responsibility, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, of a new state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland from CSL Limited to perform pharma services for CSL with capacity to serve other customers as well. The company expects to make fixed lease payments aggregating to $ 555 million (excluding renewals) from 2021 to 2041, with additional amounts dependent on the extent of revenues from customers of the facility other than CSL. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not tax deductible. On December 8, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, PPD, Inc., a U.S.-based global provider of clinical research services to the pharma and biotech industry, for $ 15.99 billion in net cash consideration and $ 43 million of equity awards exchanged. The addition of PPD’s clinical research services enhances our offering to biotech and pharma customers by enabling them to accelerate innovation and increase their productivity within the drug development process. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not tax deductible. On December 30, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, PeproTech, Inc., a U.S. based developer and manufacturer of recombinant proteins, for $ 1.86 billion in net cash consideration. PeproTech provides bioscience reagents known as recombinant proteins, including cytokines and growth factors. The acquisition expands the segment’s bioscience offerings. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not tax deductible. In addition, in 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, cell sorting technology assets, an Ireland-based life sciences distributor and a developer of a digital PCR platform; within the Analytical Instruments segment, a Belgium-based developer of micro-chip based technology for liquid chromatography columns; and within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, a transplant diagnostics information system provider.

The weighted average amortization period for all definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2021 is 14 years. The preliminary allocations of the purchase price for the acquisitions of the Lengnau biologics manufacturing facility, PPD and PeproTech were based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization, largely with respect to acquired intangible assets, lease assets and liabilities, and the related deferred taxes. Measurements of these items inherently require significant estimates and assumptions. F-19 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Unaudited Pro Forma Information The following unaudited pro forma information provides the effect of the company's 2021 acquisition of PPD as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2020: Year Ended December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Revenues $ 44,886 $ 36,887 Net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. $ 7,369 $ 5,361 The historical consolidated financial information of the company and PPD has been adjusted in the pro forma information to give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the acquisitions and related financing arrangements and are factually supportable. To reflect the acquisition of PPD as if it had occurred on January 1, 2020, the unaudited pro forma results include adjustments to reflect, among other things, the incremental intangible asset amortization to be incurred based on the preliminary values of each identifiable intangible asset and the interest expense from debt financings obtained to partially fund the cash consideration transferred. Pro forma adjustments were tax effected at the company's historical statutory rates in effect for the respective periods. The unaudited pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the combined results of operations that would have been realized had the acquisitions and related financings occurred on the aforementioned dates, nor are they meant to be indicative of any anticipated combined results of operations that the company will experience after the transaction. In addition, the amounts do not include any adjustments for actions that may be taken following the completion of the transaction, such as expected cost savings, operating synergies, or revenue enhancements that may be realized subsequent to the transaction. Pro forma net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2021, excludes $ 312 million of transaction costs, initial restructuring costs, and debt extinguishment costs directly attributable to the PPD acquisition that were included in the determination of net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. for that period. These items have reduced pro forma net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2020, by $ 197 million. The company’s results would not have been materially different from its pro forma results had the company’s other 2021 acquisitions occurred at the beginning of 2020. PPD’s revenues and losses attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. in 2021, subsequent to the acquisition date, were $ 378 million and $( 60 ) million, respectively. The loss includes non-recurring transaction and compensation costs. 2020 In 2020, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, a U.S.-based provider of a spectral dye platform for high-resolution biology applications which will extend the company’s existing tools for protein and cell analysis applications, for a total purchase price of $ 63 million including the fair value of contingent consideration. 2019 On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $ 1.67 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expanded the segment’s contract manufacturing capabilities. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $ 938 million was allocated to goodwill, $ 405 million of which is tax deductible. In addition, in 2019 the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a Slovakia-based provider of mass spectrometry software used for identification of compounds, and, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, an active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 169 million.

The weighted average amortization period for all definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2019 is 14 years. Disposition On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $ 1.13 billion, net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $ 478 million, included in restructuring and other (income) costs, net. Revenues in 2019, through the date of sale, of the business sold were approximately $ 115 million, net of retained sales through the company's healthcare market and research and safety market channels.

The company had a cash outlay of $ 51 million in 2020 associated with obtaining the loan commitments included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. F-24 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In 2019, other income/(expense) includes $ 184 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 10), offset in part by $ 44 million of net gains on investments. The investment gains include a $ 28 million gain on the sale of a joint venture for net proceeds of $ 42 million. Note 6. Stock-based Compensation Expense The company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others. These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, stock options or performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the company’s Board of Directors or, for certain non-officer grants, by the company’s employee equity committee, which consists of its chief executive officer. The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises and restricted unit vesting. Grants of stock options and restricted units generally provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option or unit holder’s employment, all options and service-based restricted unit awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment). Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier, and is primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Stock Options The company’s practice is to grant stock options at fair market value. Options vest over 3 - 5 years with terms of 7 - 10 years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions. Vesting of the option awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions. The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing the company’s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures. The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Expected stock price volatility 26 % 22 % 21 % Risk free interest rate 0.8 % 1.1 % 2.4 % Expected life of options (years) 4.3 4.3 4.3 Expected annual dividend 0.2 % 0.3 % 0.3 % The weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted during 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $ 123.97 , $ 61.19 and $ 53.37 , respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $ 501 million, $ 457 million and $ 320 million, respectively. The intrinsic value is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the option. F-25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A summary of the company’s option activity for the year ended December 31, 2021 is presented below: Shares (in millions) Weighted average exercise price Weighted average remaining contractual term (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value (in millions) Outstanding at December 31, 2020 5.9 $ 221.22 Granted 1.5 552.26 Issued in connection with an acquisition 0.2 492.35 Exercised ( 1.4 ) 183.63 Canceled/expired ( 0.2 ) 341.83 Outstanding at December 31, 2021 6.0 $ 319.95 4.5 $ 2,094 Vested and unvested expected to vest at December 31, 2021 5.7 $ 306.64 4.3 $ 2,035 Exercisable at December 31, 2021 2.8 $ 193.39 2.9 $ 1,307 As of December 31, 2021, there was $ 243 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2025 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.9 years. Restricted Share/Unit Awards Awards of restricted units convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The awards generally vest over 3 - 4 years, assuming continued employment, with some exceptions. Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions. The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period. Recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to accrue dividend equivalents. The fair value of service- and performance-based restricted unit awards is determined based on the number of units granted and the market value of the company’s shares on the grant date. For awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the award. A summary of the company’s restricted unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2021 is presented below: Units (in millions) Weighted average grant-date fair value Unvested at December 31, 2020 0.8 $ 276.74 Granted 0.4 444.61 Issued in connection with an acquisition 0.2 628.71 Vested ( 0.5 ) 295.70 Forfeited ( 0.1 ) 326.90 Unvested at December 31, 2021 0.8 $ 425.39 The total fair value of shares vested during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 151 million, $ 126 million and $ 118 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, there was $ 250 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock unit awards. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2025 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.1 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plans Qualifying employees are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan sponsored by the company. Shares may be purchased under the program at 95 % of the fair market value at the end of the purchase period and the shares purchased are not subject to a holding period. Shares are purchased through payroll deductions of up to 10 % of each participating employee’s qualifying gross wages. The company issued 0.1 million, 0.1 million and 0.2 million shares, respectively, of its common stock in 2021, 2020 and 2019 under the employee stock purchase plan. F-26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 7. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 401(k) Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans The company’s 401(k) savings and other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company’s eligible U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees. Contributions to the plans are made by both the employee and the company. Company contributions are based on the level of employee contributions. Company contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, the company charged to expense $ 299 million, $ 254 million and $ 232 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution plans. Defined Benefit Pension Plans Employees of a number of the company’s non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries. Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws. The company also maintains postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses where certain employees are eligible to participate. The liabilities and costs associated with the company’s postretirement healthcare programs are generally funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis and are not material for any period presented. The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive items, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive items is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost. When a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits. The company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the company made cash contributions of approximately $ 34 million, $ 96 million and $ 50 million, respectively. Contributions to the plans included in the following table are estimated at between $ 40 and $ 60 million for 2022. F-27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations and plan assets of the company’s domestic and non-U.S. pension plans: Domestic pension benefits Non-U.S. pension benefits (In millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Change in projected benefit obligations Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 1,302 $ 1,302 $ 1,486 $ 1,303 Acquisitions — — 170 — Service costs — — 27 24 Interest costs 23 35 11 18 Settlements — — ( 7 ) ( 38 ) Plan participants' contributions — — 6 5 Actuarial (gains) losses 20 44 ( 57 ) 119 Benefits paid ( 85 ) ( 79 ) ( 30 ) ( 26 ) Currency translation and other — — ( 54 ) 81 Benefit obligation at end of year $ 1,260 $ 1,302 $ 1,552 $ 1,486 Change in fair value of plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 1,267 $ 1,201 $ 1,160 $ 986 Acquisitions — — 158 — Actual return on plan assets 37 138 14 92 Employer contribution 7 7 27 87 Settlements — — ( 7 ) ( 38 ) Plan participants' contributions — — 6 5 Benefits paid ( 85 ) ( 79 ) ( 30 ) ( 26 ) Currency translation and other — — ( 26 ) 54 Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 1,226 $ 1,267 $ 1,302 $ 1,160 Funded status $ ( 34 ) $ ( 35 ) $ ( 250 ) $ ( 326 ) Accumulated benefit obligation $ 1,260 $ 1,302 $ 1,475 $ 1,417 Amounts recognized in balance sheet Noncurrent assets $ 32 $ 38 $ 205 $ 157 Current liability ( 7 ) ( 8 ) ( 10 ) ( 9 ) Noncurrent liabilities ( 59 ) ( 65 ) ( 445 ) ( 474 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 34 ) $ ( 35 ) $ ( 250 ) $ ( 326 ) Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive items Net actuarial loss $ 157 $ 142 $ 167 $ 242 Prior service credits — — ( 3 ) ( 2 ) Net amount recognized $ 157 $ 142 $ 164 $ 240 For domestic pension plans, actuarial losses experienced in 2021 were driven by differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets for certain portions of plan benefits indexed to asset returns, which were partially offset by actuarial gains due to increases in the weighted average discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation differences. For non-U.S. pension plans, actuarial gains experienced in 2021 were principally driven by increases in the weighted average discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation. F-28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For both domestic and non-U.S. pension plans, actuarial losses experienced in 2020 were principally driven by decreases in the weighted average discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation. For domestic pension plans, the 2020 actuarial losses were partially offset by gains recognized due to the adoption of an updated mortality assumption. The actuarial assumptions used to compute the funded status for the plans are based upon information available as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and are as follows: Domestic pension benefits Non-U.S. pension benefits 2021 2020 2021 2020 Weighted average assumptions used to determine projected benefit obligations Discount rate for determining benefit obligation 2.70 % 2.33 % 1.45 % 0.95 % Interest crediting rate for cash balance plans 2.58 % 2.16 % 1.25 % 1.25 % Average rate of increase in employee compensation N/A N/A 2.73 % 2.30 % The actuarial assumptions used to compute the net periodic pension benefit cost (income) are based upon information available as of the beginning of the year, as presented in the following table: Domestic pension benefits Non-U.S. pension benefits 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Weighted average assumptions used to determine net benefit cost (income) Discount rate - service cost N/A N/A N/A 0.65 % 1.21 % 1.97 % Discount rate - interest cost 2.33 % 3.13 % 4.22 % 0.80 % 1.44 % 2.06 % Average rate of increase in employee compensation N/A N/A N/A 2.30 % 2.27 % 2.47 % Expected long-term rate of return on assets 4.25 % 5.00 % 5.76 % 2.02 % 2.33 % 3.25 % The discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations. The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan. The company utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot-rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance. In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks. Asset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements. The expected rate of compensation increase reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on historic salary increase experience and management’s expectations of future salary increases. The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company’s qualified and non-qualified pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows: Pension plans (In millions) 2021 2020 Pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets Projected benefit obligation $ 2,010 $ 2,047 Fair value of plan assets 1,521 1,529 F-29 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company's qualified and non-qualified pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows: Pension plans (In millions) 2021 2020 Pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets Accumulated benefit obligation $ 1,937 $ 1,976 Fair value of plan assets 1,521 1,526 The measurement date used to determine benefit information is December 31 for all plan assets and benefit obligations. The net periodic pension benefit cost (income) includes the following components: Domestic pension benefits Non-U.S. pension benefits (In millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Components of net benefit cost (income) Service cost $ — $ — $ — $ 27 $ 24 $ 23 Interest cost on benefit obligation 23 35 45 11 18 24 Expected return on plan assets ( 40 ) ( 47 ) ( 55 ) ( 19 ) ( 19 ) ( 30 ) Amortization of actuarial net loss 7 6 2 12 10 6 Amortization of prior service benefit — — — — ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Settlement/curtailment loss — — — — 8 4 Net periodic benefit cost (income) $ ( 10 ) $ ( 6 ) $ ( 8 ) $ 31 $ 40 $ 26 Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining the company’s benefit obligation at December 31, 2021. Benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels, average years employed and average life spans, among other factors, and changes in any of these factors could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments. Estimated future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows: (In millions) Domestic pension benefits Non-U.S. pension benefits Expected benefit payments 2022 $ 93 $ 45 2023 89 45 2024 88 49 2025 86 52 2026 84 56 2027-2031 368 307 Domestic Pension Plan Assets The company’s overall objective is to manage the assets in a liability framework where investments are selected that are expected to have similar changes in fair value as the related liabilities will have upon changes in interest rates. The company invests in a portfolio of both return-seeking and liability-hedging assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth and to insulate the funded position from interest rate volatility. The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities. The target allocations for the investments are approximately 10 % to funds investing in U.S. equities, approximately 10 % to funds investing in international equities and approximately 80 % to funds investing in fixed income securities. The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments. Non-U.S. Pension Plan Assets The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S. The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans. Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies. When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of F-30 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) diversified assets with a variety of fund managers. The investments may include equity funds, fixed income funds, hedge funds, multi-asset funds, alternative investments and derivative funds with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 0 % - 25 % for equity funds, 40 % - 90 % for fixed income funds, 0 % - 35 % for multi-asset funds, and 0 % - 30 % for funds holding derivatives. The derivatives held by the funds are primarily interest rate swaps intended to match the movements in the plan liabilities. Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.

During 2021, the company recorded a $ 188 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of an intra-entity transfer of assets. Also in 2021, the company recorded a $ 96 million income tax benefit related to a capital loss resulting from certain intra-entity transactions. During 2020, the company settled an IRS audit relating to the 2014, 2015, and 2016 tax years. The company recorded a $ 25 million net tax benefit primarily from this settlement and related impacts, which resulted in a decrease in the company’s unrecognized tax benefits of $ 378 million, of which $ 144 million was reclassified to income taxes payable. The company recorded $ 53 million of charges for expired tax credits and other related components of the settlement. The company recorded a charge of $ 156 million to establish a valuation allowance against certain U.S. foreign tax credits which the company believes will more likely than not expire unutilized. F-33 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In 2020, the company recorded a $ 263 million income tax benefit related to a domestication transaction involving the transfer of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S., including interest expense of those subsidiaries. The company also recorded a valuation allowance of $ 212 million against the amount of interest expense that the company believes will more likely than not go unused. Also in 2020, the company recorded a $ 47 million income tax benefit, including both U.S. federal and state taxes, related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements. In 2019, the company recorded a $ 62 million income tax benefit, including both U.S. federal and state taxes, related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements as well as a tax provision of $ 191 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. Also in 2019, the company recorded a $ 79 million benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intra-entity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable. The foreign tax credits discussed below are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. In 2020, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $ 96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In 2019, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $ 75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company generally receives a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees, or the vesting of restricted stock units held by employees, for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise. The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization of tax attributes. These excess tax benefits reduce the tax provision. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, the company's tax provision was reduced by $ 124 million, $ 114 million and $ 80 million, respectively, of such benefits. Net deferred tax asset (liability) in the accompanying balance sheet consists of the following: (In millions) 2021 2020 Deferred tax asset (liability) Depreciation and amortization $ ( 4,687 ) $ ( 2,962 ) Net operating loss and credit carryforwards 1,652 1,668 Reserves and accruals 162 164 Accrued compensation 318 253 Inventory basis difference 181 112 Deferred interest 295 227 Unrealized (gains) losses on hedging instruments ( 33 ) 242 Other, net 251 124 Deferred tax liabilities, net before valuation allowance ( 1,861 ) ( 172 ) Less: Valuation allowance 968 933 Deferred tax liabilities, net $ ( 2,829 ) $ ( 1,105 ) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not expire unutilized. At December 31, 2021, all of the company’s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets, primarily net operating losses and disallowed interest expense carryforward, for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense. F-34 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The changes in the valuation allowance are as follows: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 2019 Beginning balance $ 933 $ 408 $ 471 Additions (reductions) charged to income tax provision, net 24 514 ( 27 ) Additions due to acquisitions 30 — — Reduction due to a divestiture — — ( 33 ) Currency translation and other ( 19 ) 11 ( 3 ) Ending balance $ 968 $ 933 $ 408 At December 31, 2021, the company had net federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $ 72 million, $ 88 million and $ 1.18 billion, respectively. Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2022 through 2041. Of the net non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $ 419 million expire in the years 2025 through 2041, and the remainder do not expire. At December 31, 2021, the company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $ 610 million and deferred interest carryforwards of $ 295 million. The foreign tax credit carryforwards will expire in the years 2022 through 2030 while deferred interest carryforwards do not expire. U.S. federal taxes have been recorded on $ 24 billion of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2021. A provision has not been made for certain U.S. state income taxes or additional non-U.S. taxes that would be due when cash is repatriated to the U.S. as the company’s undistributed foreign earnings are intended to be reinvested outside of the U.S. indefinitely. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable due to the uncertainty in the manner in which these earnings will be distributed. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax cost. Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of December 31, 2021, the company had $ 1.12 billion of unrecognized tax benefits substantially all of which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: (In millions) 2021 2020 2019 Beginning balance $ 1,091 $ 1,552 $ 1,442 Additions due to acquisitions 26 — — Additions for tax positions of current year 32 8 53 Additions for tax positions of prior years 60 — 69 Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 5 ) ( 296 ) ( 7 ) Closure of tax years ( 27 ) — — Settlements ( 53 ) ( 173 ) ( 5 ) Ending balance $ 1,124 $ 1,091 $ 1,552 Substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits are classified as long-term liabilities. The company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months. During 2021, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 80 million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and decreased $ 75 million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions. The company also assumed $ 26 million of uncertain tax benefits as part of the acquisition of PPD. During 2020, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits decreased $ 51 million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and $ 410 million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions which included $ 378 million from the settlement of the IRS audit of the 2014, 2015 and 2016 tax years. During 2019, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits increased $ 70 million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and $ 45 million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions. F-35 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 59 million and $ 78 million, respectively. The company conducts business globally and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to U.S. state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2012 and no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years before 2017.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) As of December 31, 2021, the annual repayment requirements for debt obligations are as follows: (In millions) Borrowings Finance Lease Liabilities 2022 $ 2,522 $ 15 2023 5,396 12 2024 4,138 12 2025 2,610 12 2026 797 12 2027 and thereafter 19,508 137 $ 34,971 $ 200 In addition to available borrowings under the company’s revolving credit agreements, discussed below, the company had unused lines of credit of $ 78 million as of December 31, 2021. These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates. Credit Facilities On January 7, 2022, the company entered into a new revolving credit facility (the Facility) with a bank group that provides for up to $ 5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit The Facility replaces the company’s $ 3.00 billion credit facility which was in place at December 31, 2021 (the prior credit facility). The Facility expires on January 7, 2027. The revolving credit agreement calls for interest at either a Term SOFR, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the prior credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $ 4 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of December 31, 2021, there were $ 2.52 billion outstanding borrowings under these programs. Senior Notes Interest is payable quarterly on the floating rate senior notes, annually on the euro-denominated fixed rate senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the fixed rate senior notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. Except for the euro-denominated floating rate senior notes, which may not be redeemed early, the floating rate senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part on or after their applicable call dates at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. The company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2021. The company intends to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the 0.000% senior notes due 2025 to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, certain green or social eligible projects. Pending allocation to green or social eligible projects, such net proceeds may be temporarily invested in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, or used to repay other borrowings. In 2021, the company redeemed some of its existing senior notes. In connection with these redemptions, the company incurred $ 767 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in other income/(expense) on the accompanying F-38 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) statement of income. Upon redemption of the senior notes, the company terminated the related fixed to floating rate interest rate swap arrangements and received $ 22 million, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. In 2019, the company refinanced certain of its debt by issuing new senior notes and using the proceeds to redeem some of its existing senior notes. In connection with these redemptions, the company incurred $ 184 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in other income/(expense) on the accompanying statement of income. Upon redemption of the senior notes, the company terminated the related fixed to floating rate interest rate swap arrangements and paid $ 17 million, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. The company also terminated related cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements and received $ 44 million, included in other investing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. In February 2022, the company redeemed all of its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025. In connection with the redemption the company incurred approximately $ 26 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2022. Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V. (Thermo Fisher International), a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued each of the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00% Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00% Senior Notes due 2025, the 0.80% Senior Notes due 2030, the 1.125% Senior Notes due 2033, the 1.625% Senior Notes due 2041, and the 2.00% Senior Notes due 2051 included in the table above (collectively, the “Euronotes”) in registered public offerings. The company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of Thermo Fisher International’s obligations under the Euronotes and all of Thermo Fisher International’s other debt securities, and no other subsidiary of the company will guarantee these obligations. Thermo Fisher International is a “finance subsidiary” as defined in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of the Exchange Act, with no assets or operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Euronotes and other debt securities issued by Thermo Fisher International from time to time. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Thermo Fisher International are consolidated in the financial statements of the company. Note 11. Leases As a lessee, the company leases certain logistics, office, and manufacturing facilities, as well as vehicles, copiers, and other equipment. These operating leases generally have remaining lease terms between 1 month and 30 years, and some include options to extend (generally for 1 to 10 years) or have options to terminate the arrangement within 1 year. The company has guaranteed the residual value of three leased operating facilities with lease terms ending in 2023, 2024 and 2025. The company has agreed with the lessor to comply with certain financial covenants consistent with its other debt arrangements (Note 10). The aggregate maximum guarantee under these three lease arrangements is $ 147 million. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities for these lease arrangements are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, but exclude any amounts for residual value guarantees. F-39 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

As of December 31, 2021, future payments of operating lease liabilities are as follows: (In millions) 2022 $ 303 2023 248 2024 193 2025 144 2026 120 2027 and thereafter 650 Total lease payments 1,658 Less: imputed interest 189 Total operating lease liability $ 1,469 As a lessor, operating leases, sales-type leases and direct financing leases are not material. Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Obligations The company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. The aggregate amount of the company’s unconditional purchase obligations totaled $ 2.51 billion at December 31, 2021 and the majority of these obligations are expected to be settled during 2022. F-40 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The Analytical Instruments segment recorded a charge to cost of product revenues for $ 108 million in 2020 related to an existing supply contract for components of electron microscopy instruments. The agreement requires the company to make future minimum purchases through 2025. The company developed and launched an alternative product beginning in 2020 and based on the expected demand for the internally developed product vs. the third-party product, the company does not expect to use all of the product it will be required to buy, resulting in a loss on the purchase commitment. Letters of Credit, Guarantees and Other Commitments Outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $ 266 million at December 31, 2021. Substantially all of these letters of credit and guarantees expire before 2039. Outstanding surety bonds and other guarantees totaled $ 95 million at December 31, 2021. The expiration of these bonds and guarantees ranges through 2023. The letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds principally secure performance obligations, and allow the holder to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit, bank guarantee or surety bond if the applicable business unit does not perform as contractually required. The company is a guarantor of pension plan obligations of a divested business. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2021 was $ 36 million. In connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with respect to those assumed liabilities. In the event a third-party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be liable to the third-party for such obligations. However, in such event, the company would be entitled to seek indemnification from the buyer. Indemnifications In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities). The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction. Where probable, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications. In connection with the company’s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties. When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility. As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement. The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position or results of operations. In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement. The company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions. Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including input from environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and F-41 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) maintenance of cleanup sites. At December 31, 2021, the company’s total environmental liability was approximately $ 65 million. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies The company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The disputes and litigation matters include product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters. A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred. The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed below, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters The company is involved in various proceedings and litigation that arise from time to time in connection with product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters. The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company’s continuing operations at December 31, 2021, was approximately $ 216 million to $ 375 million on an undiscounted basis. The portion of these liabilities assumed in the 2006 merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present) value at the date of merger. The company’s accrual for all such matters in total, including the discounted liabilities, was $ 216 million at December 31, 2021 (or $ 223 million undiscounted). The accrual includes estimated defense costs and is gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $ 100 million at December 31, 2021 (or $ 106 million undiscounted) that are included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. The portion of these insurance assets assumed in the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at the date of merger. In addition to the above accrual, as of December 31, 2021, the company had a product liability accrual of $ 11 million (undiscounted) relating to divested businesses. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. F-42 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Early in the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $ 2.00 billion of the company's common stock ( 3.3 million shares). Note 14. Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements The company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during 2021. The company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of investments in publicly traded securities, insurance contracts, investments in derivative contracts, mutual funds holding publicly traded securities and other investments in unit trusts held as assets to satisfy outstanding deferred compensation and retirement liabilities; and acquisition-related contingent consideration. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access. Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data. F-43 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company initially measures the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on amounts expected to be transferred (probability-weighted) discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs (such as likelihood of achieving production or revenue milestones, as well as changes in the fair values of the investments underlying a F-44 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. See Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information on the company's risk management objectives and strategies. Cash Flow Hedge Arrangements In 2020 and 2019, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of debt offerings. Based on the company's conclusion that the debt offerings were probable, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the interest payments on the planned fixed-rate debt issues. The aggregate fair value of the terminated hedges, net of tax, has been classified as a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive items and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt issuances. The company had cash outlays aggregating $ 85 million and $ 50 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, associated with termination of the arrangements, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. In late 2020, the company determined that the previously anticipated debt offerings were probable of not occurring and reclassified $ 42 million from accumulated other comprehensive items to other income/(expense). During 2021, in connection with the extinguishment of debt (Note 10), the company reclassified $ 65 million from accumulated other comprehensive items to other income/(expense).

Business (continued) We have approximately 13,000 sales personnel including highly trained technical specialists who enable us to better meet the needs of our more technical end-users. We also provide customers with product standardization and other supply-chain-management services to reduce procurement costs. New Products and Research and Development Our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business segments. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position. Resources Raw Materials Our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources. We do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business. Raw material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions. We employ many strategies, including the use of alternative materials, to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results. Patents, Licenses and Trademarks Patents are important in many aspects of our business. No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so important, however, that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest. Patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts. We protect some of our technology as trade secrets and, where appropriate, we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products. We also enter into license agreements with others to grant and/or receive rights to patents and know-how. Seasonal Influences Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. Sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s flu season. Sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s airborne pollen allergens. Government Contracts Although the company transacts business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results. Competition The company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve. Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors. Competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development. Our success primarily depends on the following factors: • technical performance and advances in technology that result in new products and improved price/performance ratios; • product differentiation, availability and reliability; • the depth of our capabilities; • our reputation among customers as a quality provider of products and services; • customer service and support; • active research and application-development programs; and • relative prices of our products and services. 11 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Business (continued) Government Regulation Environmental Regulations We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements. A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. Our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters. Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material. For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial measures. Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984 to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites, and are currently under the State’s Licensed Site Remediation Professional Program. As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site, and, in 2008, the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the USEPA to complete a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study. In 2018, the USEPA issued a Record of Decision, setting forth the scope of required remediation work at the site, which includes upgrading a water treatment plant to address constituents such as chlorinated organic compounds, 1,4-dioxane, and perfluorooctanoic acid/perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOA/PFOS). In 2019, the company and another responsible party signed a proposed consent decree, which the U.S. government entered in 2020, requiring the parties to finance and perform the required remediation work with USEPA oversight. In 2011, our Life Technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the USEPA and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former Davis Landfill Superfund site in Smithfield, Rhode Island. We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters. We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $71 million at December 31, 2020. These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled. We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur. As a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Other Laws and Regulations Our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies. As Thermo Fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and 12 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Business (continued) regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenues associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. Human Capital The success of Thermo Fisher Scientific is fueled by colleagues who are highly engaged and feel empowered to achieve their goals. Everything we do starts with our Mission – to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. Our colleagues understand the role they play in fulfilling that Mission and that inspires them to bring their best to work each day. Our Mission is not only a differentiator for us externally, but a motivator for us internally. Our culture is rooted in our 4i Values of Integrity, Intensity, Innovation and Involvement. Within this framework, we strive to create a safe, fair and positive working environment for our colleagues around the world. We want our teams to feel they have a stake in our success, a voice in our direction and to be empowered to make a difference for the key stakeholders we serve. Every year, we conduct an Employee Involvement Survey to solicit direct feedback from our colleagues on what we’re doing well and where we need to improve. We then compile the feedback to measure our progress using three key indices: Leadership, Involvement and Inclusion. In 2020, 84 percent of our workforce completed the survey, and we saw marked improvement in each index and across every survey question, despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic. Our continued focus on enhancing our culture helps position our company to be an even better place to work. We are committed to building the strongest team in our industry, focusing on developing and retaining our colleagues, while leveraging our leadership to attract new colleagues to our company. Of our more than 80,000 colleagues globally, as of December 31, 2020, approximately 42,000 were based in the Americas region, 12,000 were in the Asia-Pacific region, and 26,000 were in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Diversity and Inclusion We recognize that the future aspirations outlined in our Vision for 2030, which serves as our long-term roadmap, will only be achievable if we have a culture that values diversity and inclusion. While diversity of gender and ethnicity are important – and we’re focused on continuously improving– for us, diversity of backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints is equally vital to our long-term success. When those differences are welcomed and supported, we create an inclusive workplace that unlocks the true benefits of diversity. Diversity and Inclusion is not an initiative at Thermo Fisher Scientific. It’s woven into the fabric of our culture, and our colleagues are encouraged to openly share the wide range of perspectives they represent. We work together to create an inclusive culture where our colleagues feel they belong and are empowered to contribute, collaborate and innovate. Embracing individual differences is critical to our success. For example, Thermo Fisher was named a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality for the sixth consecutive year in 2020. Establishing this kind of environment is critical in empowering our colleagues so they can contribute their best ideas and bring their true selves to work each day. Our D&I focus is embedded in every stage of our colleague lifecycle – from recruiting to onboarding, training, development and longer-term career planning. We track our progress on our D&I strategic objectives through a core set of metrics that are reviewed during routine business operating mechanisms, including Quarterly Business Reviews, Human Resource Reviews, Board Reviews and through team dashboards that are shared each month with leaders across the company. This enables frequent, meaningful, data-driven discussions across our businesses and functions on a range of D&I factors, including gender and ethnic representation. This approach also ensures we consistently prioritize our opportunities to improve. We understand the critical role diversity plays in sustained business success, and our teams are empowered to ensure our workforce represents the customers we serve. We are committed to ensuring our colleagues have access to resources, awareness training and internal networks that offer support and guidance. Our diversity and inclusion strategy is greatly enabled by our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which bring together individuals with similar interests to share experiences, learn from each other and collaborate to identify solutions 13 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Business (continued) to business challenges. Our ERGs reinforce that all colleagues can make a difference for our customers, for each other and for our company. As of December 31, 2020, we had 10 ERGs globally, with 220 local ERG chapters. Talent Development Our overarching goal from a talent perspective is to create opportunities for our colleagues to achieve their full potential and career aspirations here at Thermo Fisher Scientific. We are committed to creating an exceptional colleague experience from their first day throughout their career with us. We focus on the entire lifecycle of a colleague’s career, from their initial recruitment, to onboarding, through ongoing development and training to enhance their skills so they are in the best position to deliver on their goals and achieve their career aspirations. In today’s environment, we know talent is a key competitive advantage, and that building the strongest team in the industry is critical to our future. From our colleague referral program, summer internships, university relations, to our Graduate Leadership Development Program, we continue to build strong internal and external sourcing channels. Once on board, talent development at Thermo Fisher is a key organizational capability. We continue to make significant investments to support our colleagues along every step of their career journey to help support their success. Our talent development framework incorporates a multi-faceted approach, including formal and self-paced training, networking opportunities, on-the-job stretch learning, coaching, mentoring and manager training utilizing contemporary technology solutions to support the broad needs of our workforce. We provide multiple programs at all career levels, from online learning for all colleagues through Thermo Fisher University, to focused trainings for managers at various experience levels, to our Global Leadership Program for executives. We also support our colleagues’ career advancement through our tuition reimbursement program. In a company our size, we can also actively manage our talent through rotational opportunities across our businesses, functions and geographies that help our colleagues gain new experiences, share knowledge and broaden their skills. Our executives and leaders participate in frequent talent discussions as well as formal reviews, leveraging workforce data and predictive analytics to better anticipate the talent requirements of our business based on our growth opportunities and market demand. Thermo Fisher is dedicated to talent development to meet our evolving business needs and to provide our colleagues with opportunities for long and fulfilling careers. Our colleagues are passionate about our company, and their role in our success, and it’s our responsibility to help them reach their full potential. Total Rewards We offer a comprehensive total rewards package that we regularly evaluate and measure against established benchmarks to ensure its effectiveness in recruiting and retention, and to position Thermo Fisher as an employer of choice. Our health and wellness programs provide competitive, flexible programs that our global colleagues and their families can count on. For example, for U.S. colleagues, we offer a choice of comprehensive national medical, dental and vision plans; a wellness program, including valuable health incentive opportunities and tax-advantaged savings and spending accounts; as well as commuter benefits, employee assistance programs, optional group legal coverage, and company-paid disability, accident and life insurance. We also offer a company-paid proprietary program for cancer care called the Impact Program, which gives our colleagues and their families access to personalized support and direct lines of communication to experts in cancer genetics and genomics. Similar benefits are available in all countries around the world where we operate. We also invest in our colleagues’ financial health, helping them to grow and protect their savings, plan for the future and share in the success of the company they are helping to build. We deliver comprehensive rewards, including competitive base pay, and also provide a variety of incentive and equity programs that, by design, directly link the impact of colleague contributions to the company’s overall success.

Risk Factors Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in Item 1. Business under the caption “Forward-looking Statements”. Industry and Economic Risks Our growth would suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets would diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. We are subject to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as COVID-19. The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty and worldwide economic disruption, resulting in an economic slowdown of potentially extended duration. COVID-19 has had an adverse impact on certain of our operations, supply chains and distribution systems, including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. Due to these impacts and measures, we have experienced significant and unpredictable reductions as well as increases in demand for certain of our products. Many employers in the United States and Europe are continuing to require their employees to work from home or not go into their offices. If the pandemic continues and conditions worsen, we could experience a decline in sales activities and customer orders in certain of our businesses, and it remains uncertain what impact these declines would have on future sales and customer orders once conditions begin to improve. In addition to existing travel restrictions, countries may continue to close or decline to reopen borders, impose prolonged quarantines, and further restrict travel, which would significantly impact our ability to support our sites and customers in those locations and the ability of our employees to get to their places of work to produce products, or significantly hamper our products from moving through the supply chain. As a result, COVID-19 may materially adversely affect revenue growth in certain of our businesses, and it is uncertain how materially COVID-19 will affect our global operations generally if these impacts were to persist or worsen over an extended 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) period of time. The extent and duration of the impacts are uncertain and dependent in part on customers returning to work and economic activity ramping up. The company has mobilized to support the COVID-19 response with products and services that help diagnose the virus as well as assisting customers to develop potential therapeutics and vaccines used to protect from the virus. Our ability to continue to manufacture products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our factory employees. The ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19. While we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our employees, these measures may not be successful, and we may be required to temporarily close facilities or take other measures. While we are staying in close communication with our sites, employees, customers and suppliers and acting to mitigate the impact of this dynamic and evolving situation, the duration and extent of the effect of COVID-19 on the company is not determinable. In addition, several of the company’s businesses have had an increase in revenues due to sales of products addressing diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. While these positive impacts are expected to continue into 2021, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing demand. Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, continue to be unstable (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of • reducing demand for some of our products; • increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays; • increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; • increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services; • causing supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; and • creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds. Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations. International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the “functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. As our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In 2020, currency translation had a favorable effect of $133 million on revenues due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: • interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; • changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions; • changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers; • tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs recently adopted by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods; • the impact of public health epidemics/pandemics on the global economy, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; • negative consequences from changes in tax laws; 16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; • differing labor regulations; • differing protection of intellectual property; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and • geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war. For example, on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union, or EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and on December 24, 2020, the U.K. and EU announced they had entered into a post-Brexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues. This withdrawal has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years. Our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU. In addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the United Kingdom. These possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, may adversely affect our operating results and our customers’ businesses. Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies. Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget. An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending. Business Risks We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive. Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenues and operating results would suffer. Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenues. It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including: • strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; • allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; • developing new applications for our technologies; • expanding our service offerings; • continuing key customer initiatives; • combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively; 17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) • finding new markets for our products; and • continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings. We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business. Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us. Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor. Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us. In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers. We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers. Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us. Our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company. Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business. Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $26.04 billion and $1.24 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $11.45 billion as of December 31, 2020. We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. We assess the realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. Operational Risks Our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials or components could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. Some of our businesses purchase certain materials from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues such as COVID-19, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies. A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business. As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We also rely on our information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners) and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as interacting with suppliers, selling our products and services, fulfilling orders and billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, 18 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) providing services and support to customers, tracking customer activity, fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise conducting business). Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, phishing, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results. Any of the cyber-attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above, if significant, could materially interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation imposes significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data. Several countries, such as China and Russia, have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flows. Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel. While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs. Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe. We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected. Natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may disrupt our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, and could impact customer spending. We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk. An earthquake or other natural disaster such as a fire or hurricane or power shortages or outages could disrupt our operations or impair our critical systems. Any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control, such as strikes or other labor unrest, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing or warehouse facilities, or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict, or other events outside of our control, such as strikes or other labor unrest, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact customer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally, which could also adversely impact our operating results. For example, as described above, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 19 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) Legal, Quality and Regulatory Risks Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, we manufacture pharmaceuticals and many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenues associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. Our pharma services offerings are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers, our business could suffer. Our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements. Our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our quality management strategy and systems, and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. A failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products. In each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether. In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such failure could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenues, reimbursement to customers for lost drug product, registered intermediates, registered starting materials, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, other customer claims, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. Production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high. If problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market, we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of which could be significant. We are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. We may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers. Additionally, products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all. We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies. We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (the FDA), the U.S. 20 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS), the European Medicines Agency (the EMA), in Europe, the EU member states and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale. The manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices and pharma services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. We are the sole manufacturer of a number of pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers' ability to provide products to their customers. We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We have internal controls and compliance systems to protect the company against acts committed by employees, agents or businesses that we acquire that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy, but we cannot provide assurance that these controls and systems will prevent every such wrongful act. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies which we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In 21 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to Financial Profile Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Our existing and future indebtedness may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities and negatively impact our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $21.74 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $3.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5:1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as the impact of public health epidemics/pandemics like COVID-19, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit 22 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements , which begin on page F-1 of this report. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for 2018 is included in Item 7 of the company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s operations fall into four segments (Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. The company mobilized in early 2020 to support the COVID-19 pandemic response with products and services that help analyze, diagnose and protect from the virus. However, the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the 2020 results of the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the company’s other three segments. The extent and duration of the negative impacts continuing into 2021 are uncertain and dependent in part on the success of global efforts to control the pandemic and economic activity ramping up. The company believes the impacted businesses’ long-term prospects remain excellent given the company’s attractive markets served, its industry-leading position and proven growth strategy. Several of the company’s businesses have had a significant increase in revenues due to sales of product and services addressing diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, including test kits and, to a lesser extent, products and services for therapy and vaccine development and manufacturing. While these positive impacts are expected to continue into 2021, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing demand. Recent Acquisitions and Divestiture The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent acquisitions and divestitures are described below. On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $1.67 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expanded the segment’s contract manufacturing capabilities. Brammer Bio reported revenues of approximately $140 million in 2018. On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $1.13 billion, net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. Revenues in 2019, through the date of sale, and the full year 2018 of the business sold were approximately $115 million and $238 million, respectively, net of retained sales through the company's healthcare market and research and safety market channel businesses. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $ 12,168 37.8 % $ 6,856 26.8 % Analytical Instruments 5,124 15.9 % 5,522 21.6 % Specialty Diagnostics 5,343 16.6 % 3,718 14.6 % Laboratory Products and Services 12,245 38.0 % 10,599 41.5 % Eliminations (2,662) (8.3) % (1,153) (4.5) % $ 32,218 100 % $ 25,542 100 % Sales in 2020 were $32.22 billion, an increase of $6.68 billion from 2019. Sales increased $78 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $133 million in 2020. 24 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) Aside from the effects of acquisitions/divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $6.47 billion (25%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales of products that address COVID-19 testing and treatment totaled $6.63 billion in 2020, and were offset in part by lower revenues in the remainder of the business during the first half of 2020. Sales were particularly strong in diagnostic and healthcare markets, due to demand for products supporting customers diagnosing the COVID-19 virus, offset in part by lower sales of other products due to pandemic-related impacts on customer activity. Sales were also strong to customers in pharma and biotech markets where demand was strong for products and services and pandemic-related demand for therapies and vaccines also contributed to growth. Sales to customers in industrial markets decreased primarily due to lower demand from weakened economic conditions related to COVID-19. Sales to these customers returned to positive growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. Sales to academic and government customers decreased due primarily to closure of academic labs during the global pandemic. Sales to these customers returned to positive growth in the third quarter of 2020. Sales growth was particularly strong in North America and Europe and, to a lesser extent, in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2020, total company operating income and operating income margin were $7.79 billion and 24.2%, respectively, compared with $4.59 billion and 18.0%, respectively, in 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by a gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business included in the 2019 period and strategic growth investments in 2020. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Productivity improvements are calculated net of inflationary cost increases. The company recorded a provision for income taxes of $850 million in 2020 (effective tax rate of 11.8%). In 2020, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense and also recorded a net income tax benefit of $51 million from a domestication transaction involving the transfer of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S.; a $47 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements; and a $27 million tax benefit from tax audit settlements. The company recorded a provision for income taxes of $374 million in 2019 (effective tax rate of 9.2%) including $191 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In 2019, the company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements; implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense; and recorded a $79 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intra-entity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable. The effective tax rate in both 2020 and 2019 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $1.32 billion and $0.90 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2021 will be between 11% and 13% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. Net income increased to $6.38 billion in 2020, from $3.70 billion in 2019 principally due to the increase in operating income in 2020 (discussed above) offset in part by the increase in the income tax provision. During 2020, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $8.29 billion compared with $4.97 billion for 2019. The increase primarily resulted from higher cash provided by income and, to a lesser extent, lower investment in working capital in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the company’s short-term debt totaled $2.63 billion, substantially all of which was redeemed in January 2021. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $3.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 10). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount 25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $31 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $10.33 billion as of December 31, 2020 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $11.45 billion at December 31, 2020. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $26.04 billion and $1.24 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and other factors. For the goodwill impairment tests, the company considers (i) peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and (ii) estimated weighted average costs of capital. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for all of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indications of fair value based on projections of profitability and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2020, the date of the company’s annual impairment testing. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the 26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. (b) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. The company’s liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled $1.09 billion at December 31, 2020. The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the company to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income. The company estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which the company has been able to determine that its deferred tax assets will be realized, that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $933 million at December 31, 2020. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company has not provided U.S. state income taxes or additional non-U.S. taxes on certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings, as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies. These business plans and tax strategies consider: short-term and long-term forecasts and budgets of the U.S. parent and non-U.S. subsidiaries; working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated; the company’s past practices regarding non-U.S. subsidiary dividends; sources of financing by the U.S. parent, such as issuing debt or equity; and uses of cash by the U.S. parent that are more discretionary in nature, such as business combinations and share repurchase programs. However, should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its U.S. subsidiaries, including cash maintained by these non-U.S. subsidiaries, the company would recognize additional tax liabilities. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional U.S. state income tax and non-U.S. tax liabilities that the company would incur. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax costs. (c) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, are initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $78 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $133 million in 2020. Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $6.47 billion (25%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales of products that address COVID-19 testing and treatment totaled $6.63 billion in 2020, and were offset in part by lower revenues in the remainder of the business during the first half of 2020. Sales were particularly strong in diagnostic and healthcare markets, due to demand for products supporting customers diagnosing the COVID-19 virus, offset in part by lower sales of other products due to pandemic-related impacts on customer activity. Sales were also strong to customers in pharma and biotech markets where demand was strong for products and services and pandemic-related demand for therapies and vaccines also contributed to growth. Sales to customers in industrial markets decreased primarily due to lower demand from weakened economic conditions related to COVID-19. Sales to these customers returned to positive growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. Sales to academic and government customers decreased due primarily to closure of academic labs during the global pandemic. Sales to these customers returned to positive growth in the third quarter of 2020. Sales growth was particularly strong in North America and Europe and, to a lesser extent, in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2020, total company operating income and operating income margin were $7.79 billion and 24.2%, respectively, compared with $4.59 billion and 18.0%, respectively, in 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by a gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business included in the 2019 period and strategic growth investments in 2020. In 2020, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $95 million (Note 16). In 2019, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $334 million, including $482 million of net gains on the sale of businesses, principally the Anatomical Pathology business (Note 2). The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2020 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $55 million beginning in part in 2020 and, to a greater extent, in 2021. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2019 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $60 million beginning in part in 2019 and to a greater extent in 2020. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 4). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $5.28 billion (77%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $29 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was primarily driven by demand for testing to diagnose COVID-19 with higher sales of genetic sciences products and, to a lesser extent, bioscience products. Sales also grew due to higher demand for bioproduction products. Operating income margin was 50.2% in 2020 compared to 35.7% in 2019. The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment decreased $398 million to $5.12 billion in 2020. Sales decreased $437 million (-8%) due to lower revenues at existing businesses. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $39 million. The decrease in revenues at existing businesses was primarily the result of reduced demand from industrial customers following business slowing and closures due to COVID-19 and lower sales to academic customers due to pandemic-related closures. The segment returned to positive growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. Operating income margin was 15.8% in 2020 compared to 23.1% in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to sales mix, the decrease in sales, a $108 million charge related to a long-term supply contract (discussed in Note 12), and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments, offset in part by productivity improvements. Specialty Diagnostics (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 5,343 $ 3,718 44 % Operating Income Margin 25.6 % 25.0 % 0.6 pt Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $1.63 billion to $5.34 billion in 2020. Sales increased $1.73 billion (48%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $14 million and the divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business in June 2019 decreased revenues by $121 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was due to higher demand primarily driven by products addressing treatment of COVID-19, with particular strength in sales of products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel business, and to a lesser extent, microbiology and clinical diagnostics products. These increases were offset in part by lower sales in some of the segment’s businesses due to pandemic-related reductions in demand. Operating income margin was 25.6% in 2020 and 25.0% in 2019. The increase was primarily due to profit on higher sales, offset in part by sales mix and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 12,245 $ 10,599 16 % Operating Income Margin 10.4 % 12.5 % -2.1 pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $1.65 billion to $12.25 billion in 2020. Sales increased $1.41 billion (13%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $184 million due to acquisitions. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $52 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products sold through its research and safety market channel business and, to a lesser extent, service offerings of the segment's pharma services business. The increase in demand was driven by pandemic response as well as the segment’s other products and services. Operating income margin was 10.4% in 2020 and 12.5% in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to sales mix and strategic growth investments, offset in part by profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements. Other Expense, Net In 2020, the company recorded $81 million of financing costs for a terminated acquisition, primarily for amortization of loan commitment fees and entering into currency hedging contracts. In 2019, the company recorded $184 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt, offset in part by $44 million of net gains on investments. The investment gains include a $28 million gain on the sale of a joint venture for net proceeds of $42 million. In the first quarter of 2021, the company recorded approximately $197 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 10). Provision for Income Taxes The company recorded a provision for income taxes of $850 million in 2020 (effective tax rate of 11.8%). In 2020, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense and also recorded a net income tax benefit of $51 million from a domestication 30 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) transaction involving the transfer of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S.; a $47 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements; and a $27 million tax benefit from tax audit settlements. The company recorded a provision for income taxes of $374 million in 2019 (effective tax rate of 9.2%) including $191 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In 2019, the company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements; implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense; and recorded a $79 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intra-entity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable. The effective tax rate in both 2020 and 2019 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $1.32 billion and $0.90 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2021 will be between 11% and 13% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Contingent Liabilities The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading “Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters,” in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $11.65 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $5.70 billion at December 31, 2019. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $10.33 billion at December 31, 2020 and $2.40 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in cash was primarily due to the issuance of long-term senior notes in March and April 2020 and higher cash flow from operations in 2020. 2020 Cash provided by operating activities was $8.29 billion during 2020. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $1.30 billion and $508 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and liabilities provided cash of $1.45 billion primarily due to the timing of incentive compensation payments and, to a lesser extent, customer billings. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $1.32 billion during 2020, compared with $0.90 billion in 2019. During 2020, the company’s investing activities used $1.51 billion of cash, principally for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. In January and February 2021, the company completed acquisitions for approximately $950 million in cash plus contingent consideration and entered an agreement to acquire another business for $450 million in cash plus contingent consideration (Note 17). 31 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company’s financing activities provided $959 million of cash during 2020. Issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $713 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $196 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On November 8, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. On November 5, 2020, the Board of Directors replaced the existing authorization to repurchase the company’s common stock, of which $1.00 billion was remaining, with a new authorization to repurchase up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2021, the company repurchased $1.50 billion of the company's common stock. At February 24, 2021, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. As of December 31, 2020, the company’s short-term debt totaled $2.63 billion, substantially all of which was redeemed in January 2021. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $3.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 10). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $31 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $10.33 billion as of December 31, 2020 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. The company expects that for 2021, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.2 and $2.4 billion. In addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2020, which include debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) and pension obligations (Note 7), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12). 2019 Cash provided by operating activities was $4.97 billion during 2019. Cash provided by income was offset in part by increased investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $225 million and $458 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and liabilities used cash of $198 million primarily due to the timing of customer billings and tax refunds, offset in part by advanced payments from customers. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $896 million during 2019, compared with $591 million in 2018. During 2019, the company’s investing activities used $1.49 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $1.84 billion. Proceeds from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business provided $1.13 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $926 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $3.12 billion of cash during 2019. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $6.36 billion. New long-term borrowings provided cash of $5.64 billion. A net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $683 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company’s common stock and the payment of $297 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $153 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. 32 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Swiss franc, euro, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Japanese yen and Czech koruna. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2020, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2020 was $24.67 billion (Note 14). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2020 would increase by approximately $1.52 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2020 would decrease by approximately $1.92 billion. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. In 2020, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variable-rate debt would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $14 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Canadian dollars, Swiss franc, Norwegian kroner and Danish kroner. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2020 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of approximately $1.22 billion. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2020 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an additional unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $410 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2020 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $348 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2020 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $18 million on the company’s net income. 33 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of F-2 internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Goodwill impairment assessment As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $26,041 million as of December 31, 2020. Management assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Management estimates the fair values of its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer market multiples. The Company would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (limited to the amount of goodwill). As disclosed by management, estimates of discounted future cash flows require management to make assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and other factors. Management also considers peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and estimates weighted average costs of capital. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when estimating the fair value of the reporting units, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s significant assumptions related to discount rates and peer market multiples, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. F-3 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow and market models; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the models; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to the discount rates, the terminal growth rates and peer market multiples. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to the terminal growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering the consistency with external market data. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to the peer market multiples involved evaluating the population of peer companies used in the analyses and testing selected market data used by management to determine the multiples by comparison to publicly available information. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discounted cash flow models and the discount rate assumptions. Income taxes As described in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s total income tax expense for the period ended December 31, 2020 was $850 million. The Company has deferred income tax liabilities, net, of $1,105 million (including a valuation allowance of $933 million) and unrecognized income tax benefits of $1,091 million as of December 31, 2020. As disclosed by management, the Company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires management to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and to use estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Management assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, management has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Management estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which management has been able to determine that the Company’s deferred tax assets will be realized, that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, management reverses the related valuation allowance. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to income taxes is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits due to numerous and complex tax laws, the frequency of tax filings, as well as judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the provision for income F-4 taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including controls over the realizability of deferred tax assets. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the accuracy of the income tax provision, including the rate reconciliation and permanent and temporary differences, (ii) evaluating whether the data utilized in the calculation of the provision for income taxes was appropriate and consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit, (iii) evaluating management’s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis, (iv) evaluating the identification of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and the reasonableness of the “more likely than not” determination in consideration of jurisdictions, court decisions, legislative actions, statutes of limitations, and developments in tax examinations, (v) testing the calculation of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits by jurisdiction, including estimates of the amount of tax benefit expected to be sustained, and (vi) evaluating the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgments and estimates related to the application of foreign and domestic tax laws and regulations. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 24, 2021 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

F-10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics, deliver medicines to market and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The company accounts for investments in businesses using the equity method when it has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control (generally between 20% and 50% ownership) and is not the primary beneficiary. Presentation Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. Revenue Recognition Consumables revenues consist of single-use products and are recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Instruments revenues typically consist of longer-lived assets that, for the substantial majority of sales, are recognized at a point in time in a manner similar to consumables. Service revenues (clinical trial logistics, pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services, asset management, diagnostic testing, training, service contracts, and field services including related time and materials) are recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of such services. For revenues recognized over time, the company generally uses costs accumulated relative to total estimated costs to measure progress as this method approximates satisfaction of the performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the consideration to which it expects to be entitled (i.e., the transaction price) to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognizes the related revenues when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. The company exercises judgment in determining the timing of revenue by analyzing the point in time or the period over which the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the asset. The company immediately expenses contract costs that would otherwise be capitalized and amortized over a period of less than one year. Payments from customers for most instruments and consumables are typically due in a fixed number of days after shipment or delivery of the product. Service arrangements commonly call for payments in advance of performing the work (e.g. extended service contracts), upon completion of the service (e.g. pharmaceutical development and manufacturing) or a mix of both. Some arrangements include variable amounts of consideration that arise from discounts, rebates, and other programs and practices. In such arrangements, the company estimates the amount by which to reduce the stated contract amount to reflect the transaction price. Contract-related Balances Accounts receivable include amounts that have been billed and are currently due from customers. They are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimates of expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on history of similarly aged receivables, the creditworthiness of the customer, reasons for delinquency, current economic conditions, expectations associated with future events and circumstances where reasonable and supportable forecasts are available and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. Receivables from academic and government customers as well as large, well-capitalized commercial customers have historically experienced less collectability risk. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers. F-11 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2020 2019 2018 Balance at Beginning of Year $ 102 $ 117 $ 109 Cumulative effect of accounting change 1 — — Provision charged to expense 63 20 18 Accounts written off ( 34 ) ( 32 ) ( 12 ) Acquisitions, currency translation and other 3 ( 3 ) 2 Balance at End of Year $ 135 $ 102 $ 117 Contract assets include revenues recognized in advance of billings and are recorded net of estimated losses resulting from the inability to invoice customers, which is primarily due to risk associated with the company’s performance. Contract assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the amount of time expected to lapse until the company's right to consideration becomes unconditional. Noncurrent contract assets are included within other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. Contract liabilities include billings in excess of revenues recognized, such as those resulting from customer advances and deposits and unearned revenues on service contracts. Contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the periods over which remaining performance obligations are expected to be transferred to customers. Noncurrent contract liabilities are included within other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. Contract assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheet if they arise from different performance obligations in the same contract. Contract asset and liability balances are as follows: December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2020 2019 Current Contract Assets, Net $ 731 $ 603 Noncurrent Contract Assets, Net 11 17 Current Contract Liabilities 1,271 916 Noncurrent Contract Liabilities 763 594 Substantially all of the current contract liabilities balance at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was recognized in revenues during 2020 and 2019, respectively. Warranty Obligations The company provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties, primarily from historical information, in cost of product revenues at the time product revenues are recognized. While the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies, the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure and supplier warranties on parts delivered to the company. Should actual product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs or supplier warranties on parts differ from the company’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. The liability for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. Extended warranty agreements are considered service contracts, which are discussed above. Costs of service contracts are recognized as incurred. The changes in the carrying amount of standard product warranty obligations are as follows: F-12 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Year Ended December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2020 2019 Balance at Beginning of Year $ 93 $ 92 Provision charged to expense 115 115 Usage ( 108 ) ( 112 ) Adjustments to previously provided warranties, net ( 3 ) ( 2 ) Currency translation 3 — Balance at End of Year $ 100 $ 93 Leases Operating leases that have commenced are included in other assets, other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Classification of operating lease liabilities as either current or noncurrent is based on the expected timing of payments due under the company’s obligations. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Because most of the company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the company estimates incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. Lease terms include the effect of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As a lessee, the company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Research and Development The company conducts research and development activities to increase its depth of capabilities in technologies, software and services. Research and development costs include employee compensation and benefits, consultants, facilities related costs, material costs, depreciation and travel. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Restructuring Costs Accounting for the timing and amount of termination benefits provided by the company to employees is determined based on whether: (a) the company has a substantive plan to provide such benefits, (b) the company has a written employment contract with the affected employees that includes a provision for such benefits, (c) the termination benefits are due to the occurrence of an event specified in an existing plan or agreement, or (d) the termination benefits are a one-time benefit. In certain circumstances, employee termination benefits may meet more than one of the characteristics listed above and therefore, may have individual elements that are subject to different accounting models. From time to time when executing a restructuring or exit plan, the company also incurs costs other than termination benefits, such as lease termination costs, that are not associated with or will not be incurred to generate revenues. These include costs that represent amounts under contractual obligations that exist prior to the restructuring plan communication date and will either continue after the restructuring plan is completed with no economic benefit or result in a penalty to cancel a contractual obligation. Such costs are recognized when incurred, which generally occurs at the contract termination or over the period from when a plan to abandon a leased facility is approved through the cease-use date but charges may continue over the remainder of the original contractual period. Income Taxes The company recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return. F-13 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the positions and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of money. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Except where the result would be antidilutive to net income, diluted earnings per share has been computed using the treasury stock method for outstanding stock options and restricted units. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consists principally of money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined principally by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method with certain of the company’s businesses utilizing the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product or product line. In addition, the company has certain inventory that is subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company assesses the carrying value of this inventory based on a lower of cost or net realizable value analysis. The company records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the procurement of inventories, such as inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying statement of income. The components of inventories are as follows: December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2020 2019 Raw Materials $ 1,305 $ 971 Work in Process 540 517 Finished Goods 2,184 1,882 Inventories $ 4,029 $ 3,370 The value of inventories maintained using the LIFO method was $ 274 million and $ 268 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was below estimated replacement cost by $ 49 million and $ 39 million, respectively. Reductions to cost of revenues as a result of the liquidation of LIFO inventories were nominal during the three years ended December 31, 2020. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The company generally provides for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the property as follows: buildings and improvements, 25 to 40 years; machinery and equipment (including software), 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements, the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying statement of income. Property, plant and equipment consists of the following: December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2020 2019 Land $ 410 $ 396 Buildings and Improvements 2,192 1,873 Machinery, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements 6,975 5,495 Property, Plant and Equipment, at Cost 9,577 7,764 Less: Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization 3,665 3,015 Property, Plant and Equipment, Net $ 5,912 $ 4,749 F-14 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Acquisition-related Intangible Assets Acquisition-related intangible assets include the costs of acquired customer relationships, product technology, tradenames and other specifically identifiable intangible assets, and are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 2 to 20 years. In addition, the company has tradenames and in-process research and development that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. The company reviews intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate they may be impaired. Acquisition-related intangible assets are as follows: Balance at December 31, 2020 Balance at December 31, 2019 (In millions) Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Definite Lived: Customer relationships $ 16,593 $ ( 7,450 ) $ 9,143 $ 16,906 $ ( 6,997 ) $ 9,909 Product technology 5,523 ( 3,532 ) 1,991 5,544 ( 3,121 ) 2,423 Tradenames 1,213 ( 897 ) 316 1,300 ( 869 ) 431 Other — — — 9 ( 9 ) — 23,329 ( 11,879 ) 11,450 23,759 ( 10,996 ) 12,763 Indefinite Lived: Tradenames 1,235 N/A 1,235 1,235 N/A 1,235 In-process research and development — N/A — 16 N/A 16 1,235 N/A 1,235 1,251 N/A 1,251 Acquisition-related Intangible Assets $ 24,564 $ ( 11,879 ) $ 12,685 $ 25,010 $ ( 10,996 ) $ 14,014 The estimated future amortization expense of acquisition-related intangible assets with definite lives is as follows: (In millions) 2021 $ 1,591 2022 1,441 2023 1,365 2024 1,201 2025 1,101 2026 and Thereafter 4,751 Estimated Future Amortization Expense of Definite-lived Intangible Assets $ 11,450 Other Assets Other assets in the accompanying balance sheet include operating lease right-of-use assets, deferred tax assets, pension assets, cash surrender value of life insurance, insurance recovery receivables related to product liability matters, investments, certain intangible assets and other assets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the company had $ 43 million and $ 52 million, respectively, of intangible assets not derived from acquisitions, net of accumulated amortization, which are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 2 to 20 years. Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The company performs qualitative assessments to identify impairments of these investments. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the company had such investments with carrying amounts of $ 28 million and $ 34 million, respectively, which are included in other assets. F-15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Goodwill The company assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such events or circumstances generally include the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with one or more of the company’s reporting units. The company is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If the qualitative assessment results in a determination that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, the company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The company may bypass the qualitative assessment for the reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the goodwill impairment test. The company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer market multiples. The company would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (limited to the amount of goodwill). The company determined that no impairments existed in 2020, 2019 or 2018. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as follows: (In millions) Life Sciences Solutions Analytical Instruments Specialty Diagnostics Laboratory Products and Services Total Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 8,548 $ 4,950 $ 3,735 $ 8,114 $ 25,347 Acquisitions — 9 — 938 947 Finalization of purchase price allocations for 2018 acquisitions ( 2 ) — — — ( 2 ) Sale of a business — — ( 478 ) — ( 478 ) Currency translation ( 3 ) ( 38 ) ( 72 ) 11 ( 102 ) Other 1 7 ( 1 ) ( 5 ) 2 Balance at December 31, 2019 8,544 4,928 3,184 9,058 25,714 Acquisition 35 — — — 35 Currency translation 11 151 186 ( 56 ) 292 Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 8,590 $ 5,079 $ 3,370 $ 9,002 $ 26,041 Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at fair value and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition. Currency Translation All assets and liabilities of the company’s subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated at period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Currency transaction gains are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were $ 24 million, $ 52 million and $ 19 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Derivative Contracts The company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings. F-16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Swiss franc, euro, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Japanese yen and Czech koruna. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. Cash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Fair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings. Net investment hedges. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The majority of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and certain of its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company’s estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic materially adversely affected certain of the company’s businesses in 2020, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the other three segments. The extent and duration of negative impacts continuing into 2021 are uncertain and may require changes to estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify the interaction of the accounting for certain equity securities, equity method investments, and certain forward contracts and purchased options. Among other things, the new guidance clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying measurement principles for certain equity securities immediately before applying or discontinuing the equity method. The company adopted this guidance in 2020 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. Among other things, the new guidance requires the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates to be reflected in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The company expects to adopt this guidance when it is effective in 2021 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future events or conditions that would be affected such as enacted changes in tax laws or rates. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 using a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 with some items requiring a prospective method and others requiring a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. F-17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In February 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to allow reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive items (AOCI) to retained earnings for certain tax effects on items within AOCI resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). The company adopted this guidance in January 2018 and recorded the reclassifications in the period of adoption. The adoption of this guidance increased retained earnings and reduced accumulated other comprehensive items by $ 87 million and $ 89 million, respectively, on January 1, 2018. This guidance only relates to the effects of the Tax Act. For all other tax law changes that have occurred or may occur in the future, the company reclassifies the tax effects to the consolidated statement of income on an item-by-item basis when the pre-tax item in AOCI is reclassified to income. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued guidance to address the application of accounting guidance in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017. The company reported provisional amounts in its 2017 financial statements for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act for which a reasonable estimate could be determined. Adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period, which ended December 22, 2018, are included as adjustments to Provision for Income Taxes in 2018. In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance. Among other things, the new guidance will permit more hedging strategies to qualify for hedge accounting, allow for additional time to perform an initial assessment of a hedge’s effectiveness, and permit a qualitative effectiveness test for certain hedges after initial qualification. The company adopted this guidance in January 2018. The adoption of this guidance increased retained earnings by $ 3 million on January 1, 2018. In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance eliminating the deferral of the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers. The impact of this guidance in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future asset transfers which usually occur in connection with planning around acquisitions and other business structuring activities. The adoption of this guidance reduced retained earnings by $ 20 million on January 1, 2018. In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to require a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis, such as accounts receivable, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. During 2018 and 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 using a modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance reduced accounts receivable and retained earnings by $ 1 million on January 1, 2020. In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities, initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments, with corresponding right-of-use assets. The new guidance also sets forth new disclosure requirements related to leases. During 2017 - 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company adopted this guidance in January 2019. The company elected to adopt the guidance using a modified retrospective method, by applying the transition approach as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Comparative periods have not been restated. As permitted upon transition, the company did not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts were or contained embedded leases, the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, initial direct costs for any leases, or whether land easements met the definition of a lease if they were not accounted for as leases under the prior guidance. The adoption of this guidance increased retained earnings by $ 4 million on January 1, 2019. In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. This guidance requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with subsequent changes recognized in net income, except for those accounted for under the equity method or requiring consolidation. The guidance also changes the accounting for investments without a readily determinable fair value and that do not qualify for the practical expedient permitted by the guidance to estimate fair value. The adoption of this guidance reduced retained earnings and increased accumulated other comprehensive items by $ 1 million on January 1, 2018. In May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most previous revenue recognition guidance. The new standard also requires significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity's nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. During 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification, including the elimination of certain SEC Staff Guidance. The guidance is effective for the company in 2018. The company elected to adopt this guidance through application of the modified retrospective method by applying it to contracts that were not completed as of December 31, 2017 (in addition to new contracts in 2018 and thereafter). The adoption of this guidance increased retained earnings by $ 49 million on January 1, 2018. F-18 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. 2020 In 2020, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, a U.S.-based provider of a spectral dye platform for high-resolution biology applications which will extend the company’s existing tools for protein and cell analysis applications, for a total purchase price of $ 63 million including the fair value of contingent consideration. 2019 On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $ 1.67 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expanded the segment’s contract manufacturing capabilities. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $ 938 million was allocated to goodwill, $ 405 million of which is tax deductible. In addition, in 2019 the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a Slovakia-based provider of mass spectrometry software used for identification of compounds, and, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, an active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 169 million. The components of the purchase price and net assets acquired for 2019 acquisitions are as follows: (In millions) Brammer Bio Other Total Purchase Price Cash paid $ 1,710 $ 169 $ 1,879 Cash acquired ( 36 ) — ( 36 ) $ 1,674 $ 169 $ 1,843 Net Assets Acquired Current assets $ 52 $ 58 $ 110 Property, plant and equipment 147 102 249 Definite-lived intangible assets: Customer relationships 744 — 744 Product technology 65 7 72 Tradenames 7 — 7 Goodwill 938 9 947 Other assets 49 — 49 Contract liabilities ( 110 ) — ( 110 ) Deferred tax liabilities ( 110 ) ( 6 ) ( 116 ) Other liabilities assumed ( 108 ) ( 1 ) ( 109 ) $ 1,674 $ 169 $ 1,843 The weighted-average amortization periods for definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2019 are 14 years for customer relationships, 13 years for product technology and 2 years for tradenames. The weighted average amortization period for all definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2019 is 14 years. F-19 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2018 On October 25, 2018, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Becton Dickinson and Company's Advanced Bioprocessing business for $ 477 million in cash. This North America-based business adds complementary cell culture products that expanded the segment’s bioproduction offerings to help customers increase yield during production of biologic drugs. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $ 146 million was allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible. In 2018, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, a North America-based provider of a rapid DNA platform for use in forensics and law enforcement applications, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 65 million. The components of the purchase price and net assets acquired for 2018 acquisitions are as follows: (In millions) Advanced Bioprocessing business Other Total Purchase Price Cash paid $ 477 $ 55 $ 532 Fair value of contingent consideration — 11 11 Cash acquired — ( 1 ) ( 1 ) $ 477 $ 65 $ 542 Net Assets Acquired Current assets $ 53 $ 4 $ 57 Property, plant and equipment 42 — 42 Definite-lived intangible assets: Customer relationships 108 — 108 Product technology 132 31 163 Tradenames 8 — 8 Indefinite-lived intangible assets: In-process research and development — 10 10 Goodwill 146 15 161 Other assets — 14 14 Deferred tax liabilities ( 7 ) — ( 7 ) Other liabilities assumed ( 5 ) ( 9 ) ( 14 ) $ 477 $ 65 $ 542 The weighted-average amortization periods for definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2018 are 14 years for customer relationships, 13 years for product technology and 6 years for tradenames. The weighted average amortization period for all definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2018 is 13 years. Disposition On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $ 1.13 billion, net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $ 478 million, included in restructuring and other (income) costs, net.

F-23 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 6. Stock-based Compensation Expense The company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others. These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, stock options or performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the company’s Board of Directors or, for certain non-officer grants, by the company’s employee equity committee, which consists of its chief executive officer. The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises and restricted unit vesting. Grants of stock options and restricted units generally provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option or unit holder’s employment, all options and service-based restricted unit awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment). Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier, and is primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Stock Options The company’s practice is to grant stock options at fair market value. Options vest over 3 - 5 years with terms of 7 - 10 years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions. Vesting of the option awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions. The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing the company’s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures. The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Expected Stock Price Volatility 22 % 21 % 20 % Risk Free Interest Rate 1.1 % 2.4 % 2.6 % Expected Life of Options (years) 4.3 4.3 4.3 Expected Annual Dividend 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.3 % The weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted during 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $ 61.19 , $ 53.37 and $ 43.45 , respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $ 457 million, $ 320 million and $ 312 million, respectively. The intrinsic value is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the option. F-24 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A summary of the company’s option activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 is presented below: Shares (in millions) Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (a) (in millions) Outstanding at December 31, 2019 6.9 $ 176.26 Granted 1.2 343.18 Exercised ( 2.0 ) 140.99 Canceled/Expired ( 0.2 ) 227.67 Outstanding at December 31, 2020 5.9 $ 221.22 4.3 Vested and Unvested Expected to Vest at December 31, 2020 5.7 $ 217.96 4.2 $ 1,410 Exercisable at December 31, 2020 2.5 $ 165.71 3.2 $ 741 As of December 31, 2020, there was $ 107 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2024 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.5 years. Restricted Share/Unit Awards Awards of restricted units convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The awards generally vest over 3 - 4 years, assuming continued employment, with some exceptions. Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions. The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period. Recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to accrue dividend equivalents. The fair value of service- and performance-based restricted unit awards is determined based on the number of units granted and the market value of the company’s shares on the grant date. For awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the award. A summary of the company’s restricted unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 is presented below: Units (in millions) Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2019 1.0 $ 218.34 Granted 0.5 316.10 Vested ( 0.6 ) 215.35 Forfeited ( 0.1 ) 241.26 Unvested at December 31, 2020 0.8 $ 276.74 The total fair value of shares vested during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 126 million, $ 118 million and $ 114 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, there was $ 151 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock unit awards. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2024 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.0 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plans Qualifying employees are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan sponsored by the company. Shares may be purchased under the program at 95 % of the fair market value at the end of the purchase period and the shares purchased are not subject to a holding period. Shares are purchased through payroll deductions of up to 10 % of each participating employee’s qualifying gross wages. The company issued 0.1 million, 0.2 million and 0.1 million shares, respectively, of its common stock in 2020, 2019 and 2018 under the employee stock purchase plan. F-25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 7. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 401(k) Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans The company’s 401(k) savings and other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company’s eligible U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees. Contributions to the plans are made by both the employee and the company. Company contributions are based on the level of employee contributions. Company contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the company charged to expense $ 254 million, $ 232 million and $ 204 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution plans. Defined Benefit Pension Plans Employees of a number of the company’s non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries. Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws. The company also maintains postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses where certain employees are eligible to participate. The costs of the postretirement healthcare programs are generally funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis. The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive items, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive items is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost. When a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits. The company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the company made cash contributions of approximately $ 96 million, $ 50 million and $ 93 million, respectively. Contributions to the plans included in the following table are estimated at between $ 30 and $ 50 million for 2021. F-26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

For domestic pension plans, the 2020 actuarial losses were partially offset by gains recognized due to the adoption of an updated mortality assumption. F-27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The actuarial assumptions used to compute the funded status for the plans are based upon information available as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and are as follows: Domestic Pension Benefits Non-U.S. Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Weighted Average Assumptions Used to Determine Projected Benefit Obligations Discount rate for determining benefit obligation 2.33 % 3.12 % 0.95 % 1.60 % 2.20 % 2.86 % Interest crediting rate for cash balance plans 2.16 % 3.02 % 1.25 % 1.00 % N/A N/A Average rate of increase in employee compensation N/A N/A 2.30 % 2.27 % N/A N/A Initial healthcare cost trend rate 5.78 % 5.98 % Ultimate healthcare cost trend rate 4.39 % 4.48 % The ultimate healthcare cost trend rates for the postretirement benefit plans are expected to be reached between 2021 and 2040 . The actuarial assumptions used to compute the net periodic pension benefit cost (income) are based upon information available as of the beginning of the year, as presented in the following table: Domestic Pension Benefits Non-U.S. Pension Benefits 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 Weighted Average Assumptions Used to Determine Net Benefit Cost (Income) Discount rate - service cost N/A N/A N/A 1.21 % 1.97 % 1.63 % Discount rate - interest cost 3.13 % 4.22 % 3.54 % 1.44 % 2.06 % 1.84 % Average rate of increase in employee compensation N/A N/A N/A 2.27 % 2.47 % 2.59 % Expected long-term rate of return on assets 5.00 % 5.76 % 5.75 % 2.33 % 3.25 % 3.31 % The discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations. The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan. The company utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot-rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance. In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks. Asset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements. The expected rate of compensation increase reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on historic salary increase experience and management’s expectations of future salary increases.

Benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels, average years employed and average life spans, among other factors, and changes in any of these factors could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments. Estimated future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows: (In millions) Domestic Pension Benefits Non-U.S. Pension Benefits Post- retirement Benefits Expected Benefit Payments 2021 $ 93 $ 37 $ 3 2022 88 40 3 2023 86 41 2 2024 85 45 2 2025 83 47 2 2026-2030 373 268 11 F-29 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Domestic Pension Plan Assets The company’s overall objective is to manage the assets in a liability framework where investments are selected that are expected to have similar changes in fair value as the related liabilities will have upon changes in interest rates. The company invests in a portfolio of both return-seeking and liability-hedging assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth and to insulate the funded position from interest rate volatility. The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities. The target allocations for the investments are approximately 10 % to funds investing in U.S. equities, approximately 10 % to funds investing in international equities and approximately 80 % to funds investing in fixed income securities. The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments. Non-U.S. Pension Plan Assets The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S. The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans. Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies. When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers. The investments may include equity funds, fixed income funds, hedge funds, multi-asset funds, alternative investments and derivative funds with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 5 % - 25 % for equity funds, 40 % - 90 % for fixed income funds, 0 % - 10 % for hedge funds, 0 % - 5 % for multi-asset funds, 0 % to 5 % for alternative investments and 0 % - 20 % for funds holding derivatives. The derivatives held by the funds are primarily interest rate swaps intended to match the movements in the plan liabilities as well as equity futures in a synthetic equity fund which provide targeted exposure to equity markets without the fund holding individual equity positions. Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.

During 2020, the company settled an IRS audit relating to the 2014, 2015, and 2016 tax years. The company recorded a $ 25 million net tax benefit primarily from this settlement and related impacts, which resulted in a decrease in the company’s unrecognized tax benefits of $ 378 million, of which $ 144 million was reclassified to income taxes payable. The company recorded $ 53 million of charges for expired tax credits and other related components of the settlement. The company recorded a F-32 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) charge of $ 156 million to establish a valuation allowance against certain U.S. foreign tax credits which the company believes will more likely than not expire unutilized. U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted. The Tax Act includes significant changes to existing U.S. tax laws that affect the company, including a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate beginning in 2018 and creation of a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries (transition tax). The company recognized a net charge for certain aspects of the Tax Act in its 2017 financial statements for which the accounting was provisional, but a reasonable estimate could be determined. During 2018, the company completed its accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recognized net adjustments (detailed below) to the provisional amounts, totaling a net charge of $ 68 million, as a component of income tax expense. The transition tax is based on the company's total post-1986 earnings and profits, the tax on which was previously deferred from U.S. income taxes under U.S. law. The company recorded a provisional amount for the transition tax liability for each of the foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2017. After further analysis of new U.S. Treasury guidance, available tax accounting methods and elections, legislative updates, regulations, earnings and profits computations and foreign taxes, the company finalized the calculations of the transition tax liability during 2018. The increase in the liability for the transition tax in 2018 consisted of an incremental provision of $ 117 million offset in part by a $ 49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. During 2019, the company recorded a net tax provision of $ 1 million to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform based on final regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in 2019. The income tax provision consists of an incremental charge of $ 8 million offset by a $ 7 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits. The Tax Act included a provision for global intangible low-taxed income. The company has adopted a policy to account for this provision as a period cost. Other Tax Impacts In 2020, the company recorded a $ 263 million income tax benefit related to a domestication transaction involving the transfer of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S., including interest expense of those subsidiaries. The company also recorded a valuation allowance of $ 212 million against the amount of interest expense that the company believes will more likely than not go unused. Also in 2020, the company recorded a $ 47 million income tax benefit, including both U.S. federal and state taxes, related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements. In 2019, the company recorded a $ 62 million income tax benefit, including both U.S. federal and state taxes, related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements as well as a tax provision of $ 191 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. Also in 2019, the company recorded a $ 79 million benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intra-entity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable. In 2018, the provision for income taxes also included a $ 71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the 2019 sale of the Anatomical Pathology business (Note 2). The foreign tax credits discussed below are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. In 2020, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $ 96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In 2019, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $ 75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company generally receives a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees, or the vesting of restricted stock units held by employees, for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise. The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization of tax attributes. These excess tax benefits reduce the tax provision. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the company's tax provision was reduced by $ 114 million, $ 80 million and $ 77 million, respectively, of such benefits. F-33 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Net deferred tax asset (liability) in the accompanying balance sheet consists of the following: (In millions) 2020 2019 Deferred Tax Asset (Liability) Depreciation and amortization $ ( 2,962 ) $ ( 3,084 ) Net operating loss and credit carryforwards 1,668 1,231 Reserves and accruals 164 144 Accrued compensation 253 261 Inventory basis difference 112 99 Deferred interest 227 18 Other capitalized costs 44 53 Unrealized losses on hedging instruments 242 10 Other, net 80 57 Deferred tax assets (liabilities), net before valuation allowance ( 172 ) ( 1,211 ) Less: Valuation allowance 933 408 Deferred tax assets (liabilities), net $ ( 1,105 ) $ ( 1,619 ) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not expire unutilized. At December 31, 2020, all of the company’s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets, primarily net operating losses and disallowed interest expense carryforward, for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense. The changes in the valuation allowance are as follows: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2020 2019 2018 Balance at Beginning of Year $ 408 $ 471 $ 256 Additions (reductions) charged to income tax provision, net 514 ( 27 ) 223 Additions due to acquisitions — — 17 Reduction due to a divestiture — ( 33 ) — Deductions — — ( 15 ) Currency translation and other 11 ( 3 ) ( 10 ) Balance at End of Year $ 933 $ 408 $ 471 At December 31, 2020, the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $ 383 million, $ 1.69 billion and $ 5.75 billion, respectively. Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2021 through 2040. Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $ 1.62 billion expire in the years 2025 through 2040, and the remainder do not expire. At December 31, 2020, the company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $ 645 million and deferred interest carryforwards of $ 915 million. The foreign tax credit carryforwards will expire in the years 2022 through 2030 while deferred interest carryforwards do not expire. As a result of the Tax Act, U.S. federal taxes have been recorded on $ 18 billion of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2020. A provision has not been made for certain U.S. state income taxes or additional non-U.S. taxes that would be due when cash is repatriated to the U.S. as the company’s undistributed foreign earnings are intended to be reinvested outside of the U.S. indefinitely. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable due to the uncertainty in the manner in which these earnings will be distributed. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax cost. F-34 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of December 31, 2020, the company had $ 1.09 billion of unrecognized tax benefits substantially all of which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: (In millions) 2020 2019 2018 Balance at Beginning of Year $ 1,552 $ 1,442 $ 1,409 Reductions due to acquisitions — — ( 5 ) Additions for tax positions of current year 8 53 48 Additions for tax positions of prior years — 69 82 Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 296 ) ( 7 ) — Closure of tax years — — ( 5 ) Settlements ( 173 ) ( 5 ) ( 87 ) Balance at End of Year $ 1,091 $ 1,552 $ 1,442 Substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits are classified as long-term liabilities. The company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months. During 2020, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits decreased $ 51 million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and $ 410 million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions which included $ 378 million from the settlement of the IRS audit of the 2014, 2015 and 2016 tax years. During 2019, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits increased $ 70 million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and $ 45 million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions. During 2018, the company's unrecognized tax benefits increased $ 85 million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and $ 45 million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions. The company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $ 78 million and $ 67 million, respectively. The company conducts business globally and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to U.S. state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2012 and no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years before 2017.

These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates. Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility (the Facility) with a bank group that provides for up to $ 3.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The Facility expires on December 4, 2025. The revolving credit agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate (or LIBOR successor rate), a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $ 31 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under these programs. Senior Notes Interest is payable annually on the euro-denominated senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. The company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2020. In 2019, the company refinanced certain of its debt by issuing new senior notes and using the proceeds to redeem some of its existing senior notes. In connection with these redemptions, the company incurred $ 184 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in Other Expense, Net on the accompanying statement of income. Upon redemption of the senior notes, the company terminated the related fixed to floating rate interest rate swap arrangements and paid $ 17 million, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. The company also terminated related cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements and received $ 44 million, included in other investing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. F-37 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Interest Rate Swap Arrangements The company has entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks. The aggregate amounts of the swaps are equal to the principal amount of the notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the interest payment dates of the note. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate and receive a fixed rate. The variable interest rates reset monthly. The swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges of the notes. See Note 14 for additional information on the interest rate swap arrangements and related cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements. The following table summarizes the outstanding interest rate swap arrangements on the company's senior notes at December 31, 2020: Aggregate Notional Amount Pay Rate as of (Dollars in millions) Pay Rate December 31, 2020 Receive Rate 3.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (a) $ 1,000 1-month LIBOR + 1.7640 % 1.9226 % 3.00 % (a) The payments on $ 900 million notional value of these interest rate swaps are offset in part by cross-currency interest rate swaps which effectively reduced the pay rate as of December 31, 2020 from 1.92 % to a weighted average of 1.05 %. The company has entered into $ 900 million notional value of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which effectively convert a portion of the semi-annual payments related to the variable rate, U.S. dollar denominated, LIBOR-based interest rate swaps to payments on variable rate, euro denominated, EURIBOR-based cross-currency interest rate swaps. Debt Redemptions In December 2020, the company gave notice of its intention to redeem the following senior notes in January 2021: Principal Value (In millions) Redeemed 2.15 % 7 -Year Senior Notes, Due 7/21/2022 (euro-denominated) € 500 3.00 % 7 -Year Senior Notes, Due 4/15/2023 $ 1,000 4.15 % 10 -Year Senior Notes, Due 2/1/2024 $ 1,000 The redemptions were completed on January 15, 2021. In connection with the redemptions, the company received $ 22 million upon the termination of the fixed to floating rate swap arrangements on the redeemed senior notes. The company incurred approximately $ 197 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt in January 2021 due to these redemptions. Note 11. Leases As a lessee, the company leases certain logistics, office, and manufacturing facilities, as well as vehicles, copiers, and other equipment. These operating leases generally have remaining lease terms between 1 month and 30 years, and some include options to extend (generally for 1 to 10 years) or have options to terminate the arrangement within 1 year. The company’s finance leases are not material. The company has guaranteed the residual value of three leased operating facilities with lease terms ending in 2023, 2024 and 2025. The company has agreed with the lessor to comply with certain financial covenants consistent with its other debt arrangements (Note 10). The aggregate maximum guarantee under these three lease arrangements is $ 147 million. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities for these lease arrangements are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, but exclude any amounts for residual value guarantees.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Obligations The company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. The aggregate amount of the company’s unconditional purchase obligations totaled $ 1.80 billion at December 31, 2020 and the majority of these obligations are expected to be settled during 2021. The Analytical Instruments segment recorded a charge to cost of product revenues for $ 108 million in 2020 related to an existing supply contract for components of electron microscopy instruments. The agreement requires the company to make future minimum purchases through 2025. The company has developed and launched an alternative product beginning in 2020 and based on the expected demand for the internally developed product vs. the third-party product, the company does not expect to use all of the product it will be required to buy, resulting in a loss on the purchase commitment. Letters of Credit, Guarantees and Other Commitments Outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $ 350 million at December 31, 2020. Substantially all of these letters of credit and guarantees expire before 2026. Outstanding surety bonds and other guarantees totaled $ 81 million at December 31, 2020. The expiration of these bonds and guarantees ranges through 2022. The letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds principally secure performance obligations, and allow the holder to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit, bank guarantee or surety bond if the applicable business unit does not perform as contractually required. The company is a guarantor of pension plan obligations of a divested business. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2020 was $ 42 million. In connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with respect to those assumed liabilities. In the event a third-party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be liable to the third-party for such obligations. However, in such event, the company would be entitled to seek indemnification from the buyer. Indemnifications In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities). The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction. Where probable, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications. In connection with the company’s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties. When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility. As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement. The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position or results of operations. In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement. The company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions. Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future F-40 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including input from environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. At December 31, 2020, the company’s total environmental liability was approximately $ 71 million. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies The company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The disputes and litigation matters include product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters. A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred. The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed below, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company’s continuing operations at December 31, 2020, was approximately $ 209 million to $ 354 million on an undiscounted basis. The portion of these liabilities assumed in the 2006 merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present) value at the date of merger. The company’s accrual for all such matters in total, including the discounted liabilities, was $ 202 million at December 31, 2020 (or $ 214 million undiscounted). The accrual includes estimated defense costs and is gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $ 94 million at December 31, 2020 (or $ 103 million undiscounted) that are included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. The portion of these insurance assets assumed in the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at the date of merger. In addition to the above accrual, as of December 31, 2020, the company had a product liability accrual of $ 10 million (undiscounted) relating to divested businesses. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. F-41 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Note 14. Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements The company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during 2020. The company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of insurance contracts, investments in derivative contracts, mutual funds holding publicly traded securities and other investments in unit trusts held as assets to satisfy outstanding deferred compensation and retirement liabilities; and acquisition-related contingent consideration. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access. Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data. The following tables present information about the company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019: F-42 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with such future payments. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense . The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs, of the contingent consideration. F-43 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The majority of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and certain of its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. In early 2020, the company entered into cross currency swaps in anticipation of using U.S. dollars to partially finance the euro purchase price of a then pending acquisition. The swaps were terminated later in the year in connection with the termination of the acquisition agreement. Gains and losses associated with these swaps were recorded in other expense, net. The company had a cash outflow of $ 9 million associated with the termination of the swaps, included in other investing activities, net, in the accompany statement of cash flows. See Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information on the company's risk management objectives and strategies. Cash Flow Hedge Arrangements In 2020 and 2019, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of debt offerings. Based on the company's conclusion that the debt offerings were probable, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the interest payments on the planned fixed-rate debt issues. The aggregate fair value of the terminated hedges, net of tax, has been classified as a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive items and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt issuances. The company had cash outlays aggregating $ 85 million and $ 50 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, associated with termination of the arrangements, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. In late 2020, the company determined that the previously anticipated debt offerings were probable of not occurring and reclassified $ 42 million from accumulated other comprehensive items to other expense, net.

Restructuring and Other Costs (Income), Net Restructuring and other costs in 2020 primarily included continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including the closure and consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S. and Europe, and charges for the write-off of acquired technology. Restructuring and other costs in 2020 also included transaction/integration costs (including reimbursement thereof) related to recent/terminated acquisitions. In 2020, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected approximately 1 % of the company’s workforce. Restructuring and other costs (income), net, in 2019 primarily included the gain on the sale of the company’s Anatomical Pathology business, and, to a lesser extent, transaction/integration costs related to acquisitions and a divestiture; sales of inventory revalued at the date of acquisition; and continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including the closure and consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S. and Europe. In 2019, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected approximately 1 % of the company’s workforce. Restructuring and other costs in 2018 included continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including the closure and consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S. and Europe; third-party transaction/integration costs primarily related to recent acquisitions; sales of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; and environmental remediation charges. These charges were partially offset by gains on sales of real estate and favorable results of litigation. In 2018, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected approximately 1 % of the company’s workforce. As of February 24, 2021, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $ 50 million, primarily in 2021, and expects to identify additional actions during 2021 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred. 2020 During 2020, the company recorded net restructuring and other costs (income) by segment as follows: (In millions) Cost of Revenues Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Restructuring and Other Costs, Net Total Life Sciences Solutions $ — $ ( 8 ) $ 34 $ 26 Analytical Instruments — — 26 26 Specialty Diagnostics — ( 12 ) 9 ( 3 ) Laboratory Products and Services 6 5 23 34 Corporate — 5 7 12 $ 6 $ ( 10 ) $ 99 $ 95 The principal components of net restructuring and other costs (income) by segment are as follows: Life Sciences Solutions In 2020, the Life Sciences Solutions segment recorded $ 26 million of net restructuring and other charges.

We also provide customers with product standardization and other supply-chain-management services to reduce procurement costs. 10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Business (continued) New Products and Research and Development Our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business segments. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position. Raw Materials Our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources. We do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business. Raw material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions. We employ many strategies, including the use of alternative materials, to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results. Patents, Licenses and Trademarks Patents are important in many aspects of our business. No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so important, however, that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest. Patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts. We protect some of our technology as trade secrets and, where appropriate, we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products. We also enter into license agreements with others to grant and/or receive rights to patents and know-how. Seasonal Influences Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. Sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s flu season. Sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s airborne pollen allergens. Working Capital Requirements There are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital. Dependency on a Single Customer There is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. No customer accounted for more than 5% of our total revenues in any of the past three years. Backlog Our backlog of firm orders at year-end 2019 and 2018 was as follows: (In millions) 2019 2018 Life Sciences Solutions $ 893 $ 647 Analytical Instruments 2,198 2,243 Specialty Diagnostics 172 187 Laboratory Products and Services 4,577 2,042 Eliminations (72) (32) $ 7,768 $ 5,087 We believe that approximately 63% of our backlog at the end of 2019 will be filled during 2020. Government Contracts Although the company transacts business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results. 11 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Business (continued) Competition The company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve. Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors. Competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development. Our success primarily depends on the following factors: • technical performance and advances in technology that result in new products and improved price/performance ratios; • product differentiation, availability and reliability; • the depth of our capabilities; • our reputation among customers as a quality provider of products and services; • customer service and support; • active research and application-development programs; and • relative prices of our products and services. Environmental Matters We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements. A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. Our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters. Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material. For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial measures. Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984 to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites, and are currently under the State’s Licensed Site Remediation Professional Program. As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site, and, in 2008, the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the USEPA to complete a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study. In 2018, the USEPA issued a Record of Decision, including the scope of required remediation work based on findings of this study. In 2019, the company and another responsible party signed a proposed consent decree that, once approved by the court, requires the parties to finance and perform the required remediation work with USEPA oversight. In 2011, our Life Technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the USEPA and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former Davis Landfill Superfund site in Smithfield, Rhode Island. We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters. We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $66 million at December 31, 2019. These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled. We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur. As a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of 12 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Business (continued) operations or cash flows. However, we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Regulatory Affairs Our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies. As Thermo Fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. Number of Employees We have more than 75,000 employees. Available Information The company files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Exchange Act. The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information that issuers, including the company, file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at www.sec.gov. We also make available free of charge on or through our own website at www.thermofisher.com our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. In addition, paper copies of these documents may be obtained free of charge by writing to the company care of its Investor Relations Department at our principal executive office located at 168 Third Avenue, Waltham, Massachusetts 02451. 13 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Risk Factors Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in Item 1. Business under the caption “Forward-looking Statements”. We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive. Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue. It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including: • strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; • allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; • developing new applications for our technologies; • expanding our service offerings; 14 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) • continuing key customer initiatives; • combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively; • finding new markets for our products; and • continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings. We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business. Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, are unstable, it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of • reducing demand for some of our products; • increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays; • increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; • increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services; • causing supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; and • creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds. Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies. Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget. An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending. Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations. International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the “functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. As our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In 2019, currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $440 million on revenues due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: • interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; • changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions; • changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers; 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) • tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs recently adopted by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods; • the impact of public health epidemics on the global economy, such as the coronavirus currently impacting China; • negative consequences from changes in tax laws; • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; • differing labor regulations; • differing protection of intellectual property; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and • geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war. For example, on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union, or EU and entered a transition period during which it will negotiate a trade deal with the EU. This withdrawal has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years. Our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU. In addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the United Kingdom. These possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, may adversely affect our operating results and our customers’ businesses. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, we manufacture pharmaceuticals and many of our instruments are marketed to the 16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products. Our pharma services offerings are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers, our business could suffer. Our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements. Our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our quality management strategy and systems, and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. A failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products. In each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether. In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such failure could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers for lost drug product, registered intermediates, registered starting materials, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, other customer claims, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. Production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high. If problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market, we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of which could be significant. We are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. We may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers. Additionally, products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company. Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business. Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $25.71 billion and $1.25 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $12.76 billion as of December 31, 2019. We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. We assess the realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. 17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us. Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor. Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us. In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers. We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers. Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us. Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe. We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected. We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies. We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (the FDA), the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS), the European Medicines Agency (the EMA), in Europe, the EU member states and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale. The manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices and pharma services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. We are the sole manufacturer of a number of pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers' ability to provide products to their customers. We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and we are required to 18 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We have internal controls and compliance systems to protect the company against acts committed by employees, agents or businesses that we acquire that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy, but we cannot provide assurance that these controls and systems will prevent every such wrongful act. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies which we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements. Natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may disrupt our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, and could impact customer spending. We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk. An earthquake or other natural disaster such as a fire or hurricane or power shortages or outages could disrupt our operations or impair our critical systems. Any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control, such as strikes or other labor unrest, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing or warehouse facilities, or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict, or other events outside of our control, such as strikes or other labor unrest, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact customer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally, which could also adversely impact our operating results. For example, in December 2019, a strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The effects could include restrictions on our ability to travel to support our sites in China or our customers located there, disruptions in our ability to distribute products, and/or temporary closures of our facilities in China or the facilities of our suppliers or customers. Related disruption, inside or outside of China, to our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers would likely impact our sales and operating results. At this point, the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results of operations is uncertain. Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow. Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel. While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs. Our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials or components could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. Some of our businesses purchase certain materials from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If 19 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies. A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business. As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We also rely on our information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners) and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as interacting with suppliers, selling our products and services, fulfilling orders and billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers, tracking customer activity, fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise conducting business). Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, phishing, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results. Any of the cyber-attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above, if significant, could materially interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation imposes significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data. Several countries, such as China and Russia, have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. Our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $17.75 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. 20 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.5:1.0. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0:1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements , which begin on page F-1 of this report. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for 2017 is included in Item 7 of the company’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s operations fall into four segments (see Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. Recent Acquisitions and Divestiture The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent acquisitions and divestiture are described below. On October 25, 2018, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Becton Dickinson and Company's Advanced Bioprocessing business for $477 million in cash. This North America-based business adds complementary cell culture products that expand the segment’s bioproduction offerings to help customers increase yield during production of biologic drugs. The Advanced Bioprocessing business reported revenues of $100 million in 2017. On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $1.67 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expands the segment’s contract manufacturing capabilities. Brammer Bio reported revenues of approximately $140 million in 2018. On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $1.13 billion, net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $478 million, included in restructuring and other (income) costs, net. Revenues in 2019, through the date of sale, and the full year 2018 of the business sold were approximately $115 million and $238 million, respectively, net of retained sales through the company's healthcare market and research and safety market channel businesses. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $ 6,856 26.8 % $ 6,269 25.7 % Analytical Instruments 5,522 21.6 % 5,469 22.5 % Specialty Diagnostics 3,718 14.6 % 3,724 15.3 % Laboratory Products and Services 10,599 41.5 % 10,035 41.2 % Eliminations (1,153) (4.5) % (1,139) (4.7) % $ 25,542 100 % $ 24,358 100 % Sales in 2019 were $25.54 billion, an increase of $1.18 billion from 2018. Sales increased $153 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $440 million in 2019. Aside from the effects of acquisitions/divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $1.47 billion (6%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company’s primary end markets grew with particular strength in sales to customers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry. Sales growth was strong in each of the company’s primary geographic areas in 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, sales to industrial customers declined and sales growth in Asia was modest due to weaker end market conditions off of a strong fourth quarter in 2018. 23 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) In 2019, total company operating income and operating income margin were $4.59 billion and 18.0%, respectively, compared with $3.78 billion and 15.5%, respectively, in 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales, the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments, sales mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. The company recorded a $374 million provision for income taxes in 2019 including $191 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In 2019, the company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements, implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense, and recorded a $79 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intra-entity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable. The company recorded a $324 million provision for income taxes in 2018 including a net provision of $68 million to adjust the estimated initial effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) recorded in 2017, consisting of an incremental provision of $117 million offset in part by a $49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. These adjustments were required based on new U.S. Treasury guidance and further analysis of available tax accounting methods and elections, legislative updates, regulations, earnings and profit computations and foreign taxes. In 2018, the provision for income taxes also included a $71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the 2019 sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. The effective tax rate in both 2019 and 2018 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $896 million and $591 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2020 will be between 8% and 10% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. Income from continuing operations increased to $3.70 billion in 2019, from $2.94 billion in 2018 principally due to increase in operating income in 2019 (discussed above) offset in part by $184 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt in 2019 (Note 10). During 2019, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $4.97 billion compared with $4.54 billion for 2018. The increase primarily resulted from higher income before amortization and depreciation and lower investment in working capital in the 2019 period. As of December 31, 2019, the company’s short-term debt totaled $676 million, including $672 million of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $72 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $2.40 billion as of December 31, 2019 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 24 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $12.76 billion at December 31, 2019. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $25.71 billion and $1.25 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and other factors. For the goodwill impairment tests, the company considers (i) peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and (ii) estimated weighted average costs of capital. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. For reporting units where the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test, indications of fair value based on projections of profitability and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2019, the date of the company’s annual impairment testing. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. (b) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax 25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. The company’s liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled $1.55 billion at December 31, 2019. The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the company to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income. The company estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which the company has been able to determine that its deferred tax assets will be realized, that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $408 million at December 31, 2019. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company has not provided U.S. state income taxes or additional non-U.S. taxes on certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings, as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies. These business plans and tax strategies consider: short-term and long-term forecasts and budgets of the U.S. parent and non-U.S. subsidiaries; working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated; the company’s past practices regarding non-U.S. subsidiary dividends; sources of financing by the U.S. parent, such as issuing debt or equity; and uses of cash by the U.S. parent that are more discretionary in nature, such as business combinations and share repurchase programs. However, should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its U.S. subsidiaries, including cash maintained by these non-U.S. subsidiaries, the company would recognize additional tax liabilities. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional U.S. state income tax and non-U.S. tax liabilities that the company would incur. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax costs. (c) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, are initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. 26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations 2019 Compared With 2018 (In millions) 2019 2018 Total Change Currency Translation / Other * Acquisitions/Divestitures Operations Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $ 6,856 $ 6,269 $ 587 $ (122) $ 89 $ 620 Analytical Instruments 5,522 5,469 53 (96) — 149 Specialty Diagnostics 3,718 3,724 (6) (66) (126) 186 Laboratory Products and Services 10,599 10,035 564 (227) 187 604 Eliminations (1,153) (1,139) (14) 71 3 (88) Consolidated Revenues $ 25,542 $ 24,358 $ 1,184 $ (440) $ 153 $ 1,471 * Currency Translation/Other for the Laboratory Products and Services segment includes a reduction of revenue of $60 million for the impact of a change in the method of reporting certain intersegment sales with no impact on consolidated results. Sales in 2019 were $25.54 billion, an increase of $1.18 billion from 2018. Sales increased $153 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $440 million in 2019. Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $1.47 billion (6%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company’s primary end markets grew with particular strength in sales to customers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry. Sales growth was strong in each of the company’s primary geographic areas in 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, sales to industrial customers declined and sales growth in Asia was modest due to weaker end market conditions off of a strong fourth quarter in 2018. In 2019, total company operating income and operating income margin were $4.59 billion and 18.0%, respectively, compared with $3.78 billion and 15.5%, respectively, in 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales, the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments, sales mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. In 2019, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $334 million, including $482 million of net gains on the sale of businesses, principally the Anatomical Pathology business (see Note 2). The company also recorded $17 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, and $62 million of net charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally transaction and integration-related costs related to acquisitions and a divestiture. In addition, the company recorded $52 million of cash restructuring charges, net, primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe (see Note 16). In 2018, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $91 million, including $12 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company recorded $29 million of net charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs associated with recent and pending acquisitions, offset in part by income from favorable results of product liability litigation. In addition, the company recorded $88 million of cash restructuring costs, in its continued effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S. and Europe. The company also recorded $38 million of other income, net, principally for resolution of a litigation matter. As of February 26, 2020, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $65 million, primarily in 2020, and expects to identify additional actions during 2020 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred. Approximately 25% of the additional charges will be incurred in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, 30% in the Analytical Instruments segment, 35% in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, and 10% in the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2019 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $60 million beginning in part in 2019 and, to a greater extent, in 2020, including $20 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $15 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $5 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $20 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2018 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $65 million beginning in part in 2018 and to a greater extent in 2019, including $20 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $10 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $5 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $30 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 4). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.

Life Sciences Solutions (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Revenues $ 6,856 $ 6,269 9 % Operating Income Margin 35.7 % 34.4 % 1.3 pt 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $587 million to $6.86 billion in 2019. Sales increased $620 million (10%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $89 million due to an acquisition. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $122 million. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment's principal businesses with particular strength in sales of bioproduction and biosciences products. Operating income margin was 35.7% in 2019 compared to 34.4% in 2018. The increase in operating margin resulted primarily from profit on higher sales offset in part by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, sales mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Analytical Instruments (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Revenues $ 5,522 $ 5,469 1 % Operating Income Margin 23.1 % 22.8 % 0.3 pt Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $53 million to $5.52 billion in 2019. Sales increased $149 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $96 million. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was due to increased demand for products sold by each of the segment's primary businesses with particular strength in chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments. Sales decreased in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to industrial end market conditions off of a strong fourth quarter of 2018. Operating income margin was 23.1% in 2019 compared to 22.8% in 2018. The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by sales mix and strategic growth investments. Specialty Diagnostics (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Revenues $ 3,718 $ 3,724 — % Operating Income Margin 25.0 % 25.6 % -0.6 pt Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment remained flat at $3.72 billion in 2019. Sales increased $186 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $66 million and the divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business decreased revenues by $126 million. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was due to increased demand for products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel as well as clinical diagnostic and immunodiagnostic products. Operating income margin was 25.0% in 2019 and 25.6% in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, sales mix and the divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business. These decreases were offset in part by profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. Following multi-year extensions of several expiring licensing arrangements with commercial partners, segment revenues and operating income in 2020 will both be unfavorably affected by approximately $30 million. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Revenues $ 10,599 $ 10,035 6 % Operating Income Margin 12.5 % 12.5 % 0 pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $564 million to $10.60 billion in 2019. Sales increased $604 million (6%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $187 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $167 million. A change in the method of reporting certain intersegment sales reduced segment revenues by $60 million with no impact to consolidated results. The increase in revenue at 29 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment's principal businesses with particular strength in service offerings of its pharma services business and products sold through its research and safety market channel business. Operating income margin was 12.5% in both 2019 and 2018. Increases from profit on higher sales and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, were offset by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, sales mix. Other Expense/Income, Net In 2019, the company recorded $184 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt, offset in part by $44 million of net gains on investments. The investment gains include a $28 million gain on the sale of a joint venture for net proceeds of $42 million. In 2018, the company recorded $15 million of net losses on investments. Provision for Income Taxes The company recorded a $374 million provision for income taxes in 2019 including $191 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In 2019, the company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements, implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense, and recorded a $79 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intra-entity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable. The company recorded a $324 million provision for income taxes in 2018 including a net provision of $68 million to adjust the estimated initial effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 recorded in 2017, consisting of an incremental provision of $117 million offset in part by a $49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. These adjustments were required based on new U.S. Treasury guidance and further analysis of available tax accounting methods and elections, legislative updates, regulations, earnings and profit computations and foreign taxes. In 2018, the provision for income taxes also included a $71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the 2019 sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. The effective tax rate in both 2019 and 2018 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $896 million and $591 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2020 will be between 8% and 10% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “ Recent Accounting Pronouncements ” in Note 1. Contingent Liabilities The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the headings “ Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters ,” and “ Intellectual Property Matters ” in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. 30 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $5.70 billion at December 31, 2019, compared with $4.48 billion at December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower short-term debt and higher cash balances. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $2.40 billion at December 31, 2019 and $2.10 billion at December 31, 2018. 2019 Cash provided by operating activities was $4.97 billion during 2019. Cash provided by income was offset in part by increased investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $225 million and $458 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $408 million primarily due to the timing of customer billings and tax refunds. Other liabilities increased by $210 million primarily due to advance payments from customers. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $896 million during 2019, compared with $591 million in 2018. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $50 million during 2019. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $69 million during 2019. During 2019, the company’s investing activities used $1.49 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $1.84 billion. Proceeds from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business provided $1.13 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $926 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $3.12 billion of cash during 2019. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $6.36 billion. New long-term borrowings provided cash of $5.64 billion. A net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $683 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company’s common stock and the payment of $297 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $153 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On November 8, 2019, the Board of Directors replaced the existing authorization to repurchase the company’s common stock, of which $500 million was remaining, with a new authorization to repurchase up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. At February 26, 2020, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. As of December 31, 2019, the company’s short-term debt totaled $676 million, including $672 million of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $72 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $2.40 billion as of December 31, 2019 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2018 Cash provided by operating activities was $4.54 billion during 2018. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $366 million and $324 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $591 million during 2018, compared with $479 million in 2017. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $93 million during 2018. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $83 million during 2018. During 2018, the company’s investing activities used $1.25 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $536 million. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $758 million of property, plant and equipment. 31 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company’s financing activities used $2.24 billion of cash during 2018. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $2.05 billion. New long-term borrowings provided cash of $690 million. A net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $194 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $500 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $266 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $136 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2017, 2018 or 2019, except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, residual value guarantees under three lease agreements, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table or discussed below. The amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees relate to guarantees of the company’s performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019. Payments due by Period or Expiration of Commitment (In millions) 2020 2021 and 2022 2023 and 2024 2025 and Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Debt principal, including short-term debt (a) $ 673 $ 562 $ 3,122 $ 13,593 $ 17,950 Finance lease obligations 3 6 1 — 10 Interest 371 742 652 2,694 4,459 Operating lease obligations 197 282 160 197 836 Unconditional purchase obligations (b) 830 283 86 4 1,203 Letters of credit and bank guarantees 232 23 9 8 272 Surety bonds and other guarantees 45 16 — — 61 Pension obligations on balance sheet 42 91 100 336 569 Asset retirement obligations accrued on balance sheet 7 14 5 15 41 Acquisition-related contingent consideration accrued on balance sheet 11 20 8 16 55 $ 2,411 $ 2,039 $ 4,143 $ 16,863 $ 25,456 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for debt and do not include any deferred issuance costs. (b) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.55 billion have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, other than those included in the above table, but expects that for 2020, such expenditures will be between $1 and $1.1 billion. Guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for three facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment (see Note 11). The residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of $147 million. The terms of these leases end in 2020, 2023 and 2024. A guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2019 was $41 million. 32 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Swiss franc, euro, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen and Czech koruna. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2019, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2019 was $18.67 billion (see Note 14). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2019 would increase by approximately $1.49 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2019 would decrease by approximately $1.50 billion. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. In 2019, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variable-rate debt would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $16 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, euro, Canadian dollars, Swiss franc, Norwegian kroner and Danish kroner. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2019 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $1.14 billion. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2019 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an additional unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $243 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2019 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $203 million. The 33 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2019 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $32 million on the company’s net income.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a F-2 material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Goodwill impairment assessment As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $25,714 million as of December 31, 2019. Management evaluates goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. In performing the assessment, management estimates the fair values of its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer market multiples. As disclosed by management, estimates of discounted future cash flows require management to make assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and other factors. Management also considers peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and estimates weighted average costs of capital. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when estimating the fair value of the reporting units. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s cash flow projections and significant assumptions, including revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and peer market multiples. In addition, the audit F-3 effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the development of assumptions used by management to estimate the fair values of the Company’s reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the models; and evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions used, including revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and peer market multiples. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting units and (ii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluating the reasonableness of the peer market multiples assumption involved evaluating the population of peer companies used in the analyses and testing selected market data used by management to determine the multiples by comparison to publicly available information. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the Company’s discounted cash flow model and certain significant assumptions, including the discount rates. Income taxes As described in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s total income tax expense for the period ended December 31, 2019 was $374 million. The Company has deferred income tax liabilities, net, of $1,619 million (including a valuation allowance of $408 million) and unrecognized income tax benefits of $1,552 million as of December 31, 2019. As disclosed by management, the Company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires management to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and t0 use estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Management assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, management has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Management estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which management has been able to determine that the Company’s deferred tax assets will be realized, that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, management reverses the related valuation allowance. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to income taxes is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits due to numerous and complex tax laws, the frequency of tax filings, as well as judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and F-4 liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including controls over management’s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the accuracy of the income tax provision, including the rate reconciliation and permanent and temporary differences, (ii) evaluating whether the data utilized in the calculation of the provision for income taxes was appropriate and consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit, (iii) evaluating management’s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis, (iv) evaluating the identification of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and the reasonableness of the “more likely than not” determination in consideration of jurisdictions, court decisions, legislative actions, statutes of limitations, and developments in tax examinations, (v) testing the calculation of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits by jurisdiction, including estimates of the amount of tax benefit expected to be sustained, and (vi) evaluating the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgments and estimates, including application of foreign and domestic tax laws and regulations. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 26, 2020 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

F-10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics, deliver medicines to market and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The company accounts for investments in businesses using the equity method when it has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control (generally between 20% and 50% ownership) and is not the primary beneficiary. Presentation Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. Revenue Recognition Prior to 2018, the company recognized revenue after all significant obligations had been met, collectability was probable and title had passed, which typically occurred upon shipment, delivery, completion of services, or ratably over the contract period. Beginning in 2018, the company recognizes revenue as performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements below for a discussion of the change in revenue recognition accounting that became effective in 2018. Consumables revenues consist of single-use products and are recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Instruments revenues typically consist of longer-lived assets that, for the substantial majority of sales, are recognized at a point in time in a manner similar to consumables. Service revenues (clinical trial logistics, pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services, asset management, diagnostic testing, training, service contracts, and field services including related time and materials) are recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of such services. For revenues recognized over time, the company generally uses costs accumulated relative to total estimated costs to measure progress as this method approximates satisfaction of the performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the consideration to which it expects to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognizes the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. The company exercises judgment in determining the timing of revenue by analyzing the point in time or the period over which the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the asset. The company immediately expenses contract costs that would otherwise be capitalized and amortized over a period of less than one year. Payments from customers for most instruments, consumables and services are typically due in a fixed number of days after shipment or delivery of the product. Service arrangements commonly call for payments in advance of performing the work (e.g. extended service contracts), upon completion of the service (e.g. pharmaceutical development and manufacturing) or a mix of both. See Note 3 for revenue disaggregated by type and by geographic region as well as further information about remaining performance obligations. Contract-related Balances Accounts receivable include amounts that have been billed and are currently due from customers. They are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers. F-11 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2019 2018 2017 Beginning Balance $ 117 $ 109 $ 77 Provision charged to expense 20 18 32 Accounts written off ( 32 ) ( 12 ) ( 10 ) Acquisitions, currency translation and other ( 3 ) 2 10 Ending Balance $ 102 $ 117 $ 109 Contract assets include revenues recognized in advance of billings and are recorded net of estimated losses resulting from the inability to invoice customers. Contract assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the amount of time expected to lapse until the company's right to consideration becomes unconditional. Noncurrent contract assets are included within other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. Contract liabilities include billings in excess of revenues recognized, such as those resulting from customer advances and deposits and unearned revenue on service contracts. Contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the periods over which remaining performance obligations are expected to be transferred to customers. Noncurrent contract liabilities are included within other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. Contract assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheet if they arise from different performance obligations in the same contract. Contract asset and liability balances are as follows: December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2019 2018 Current Contract Assets, Net $ 603 $ 459 Noncurrent Contract Assets, Net 17 15 Current Contract Liabilities 916 809 Noncurrent Contract Liabilities 594 355 Substantially all of the current contract liabilities balance at December 31, 2018 and January 1 2018, was recognized in revenue during 2019 and 2018, respectively. Contract assets increased in 2019 primarily due to growth in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services. Contract liabilities increased during 2019 primarily due to an advance payment from a customer and an acquisition. Warranty Obligations The company provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties, primarily from historical information, in cost of product revenues at the time product revenue is recognized. While the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies, the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure and supplier warranties on parts delivered to the company. Should actual product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs or supplier warranties on parts differ from the company’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. The liability for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. Extended warranty agreements are considered service contracts, which are discussed above. Costs of service contracts are recognized as incurred. The changes in the carrying amount of standard product warranty obligations are as follows: F-12 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Year Ended December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2019 2018 Beginning Balance $ 92 $ 87 Provision charged to income 115 121 Usage ( 112 ) ( 109 ) Adjustments to previously provided warranties, net ( 2 ) ( 4 ) Currency translation — ( 3 ) Ending Balance $ 93 $ 92 Leases The company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. Prior to 2019, the company did not account for operating leases on the balance sheet. Beginning in 2019, as discussed below under Recent Accounting Pronouncements, operating leases that have commenced are included in other assets, other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Classification of operating lease liabilities as either current or noncurrent is based on the expected timing of payments due under the company’s obligations. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Because most of the company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the company estimates incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. Lease terms may include the effect of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As a lessee, the company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. See Note 11 additional information about the company's leases. Research and Development The company conducts research and development activities to increase its depth of capabilities in technologies, software and services. Research and development costs include employee compensation and benefits, consultants, facilities related costs, material costs, depreciation and travel. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Restructuring Costs Accounting for the timing and amount of termination benefits provided by the company to employees is determined based on whether: (a) the company has a substantive plan to provide such benefits, (b) the company has a written employment contract with the affected employees that includes a provision for such benefits, (c) the termination benefits are due to the occurrence of an event specified in an existing plan or agreement, or (d) the termination benefits are a one-time benefit. In certain circumstances, employee termination benefits may meet more than one of the characteristics listed above and therefore, may have individual elements that are subject to different accounting models. From time to time when executing a restructuring or exit plan, the company also incurs costs other than termination benefits, such as lease termination costs, that are not associated with or will not be incurred to generate revenues. These include costs that represent amounts under contractual obligations that exist prior to the restructuring plan communication date and will either continue after the restructuring plan is completed with no economic benefit or result in a penalty to cancel a contractual obligation. Such costs are recognized when incurred, which generally occurs at the contract termination or over the period from when a plan to abandon a leased facility is approved through the cease-use date but charges may continue over the remainder of the original contractual period. F-13 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Income Taxes The company recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return. The financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the positions and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of money (Note 8). Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Except where the result would be antidilutive to income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share has been computed using the treasury stock method for outstanding stock options and restricted units (Note 9). Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consists principally of money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined principally by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method with certain of the company’s businesses utilizing the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product or product line. In addition, the company has certain inventory that is subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company assesses the carrying value of this inventory based on a lower of cost or net realizable value analysis. The company records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the procurement of inventories, such as inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying statement of income. The components of inventories are as follows: December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2019 2018 Raw Materials $ 971 $ 812 Work in Process 517 430 Finished Goods 1,882 1,763 Inventories $ 3,370 $ 3,005 The value of inventories maintained using the LIFO method was $ 268 million and $ 244 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which was below estimated replacement cost by $ 39 million and $ 34 million, respectively. Reductions to cost of revenues as a result of the liquidation of LIFO inventories were nominal during the three years ended December 31, 2019. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The company provides for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the property as follows: buildings and improvements, 25 to 40 years; machinery and equipment (including software), 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements, the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying statement of income. Property, plant and equipment consists of the following: F-14 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Acquisition-related Intangible Assets Acquisition-related intangible assets include the costs of acquired customer relationships, product technology, tradenames and other specifically identifiable intangible assets, and are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 2 to 20 years. In addition, the company has tradenames and in-process research and development that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. The company reviews intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate they may be impaired. Acquisition-related intangible assets are as follows: Balance at December 31, 2019 Balance at December 31, 2018 (In millions) Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Definite Lived: Customer relationships $ 16,906 $ ( 6,997 ) $ 9,909 $ 17,120 $ ( 6,833 ) $ 10,287 Product technology 5,544 ( 3,121 ) 2,423 6,036 ( 3,178 ) 2,858 Tradenames 1,300 ( 869 ) 431 1,495 ( 929 ) 566 Other 9 ( 9 ) — 33 ( 33 ) — 23,759 ( 10,996 ) 12,763 24,684 ( 10,973 ) 13,711 Indefinite Lived: Tradenames 1,235 N/A 1,235 1,235 N/A 1,235 In-process research and development 16 N/A 16 32 N/A 32 1,251 N/A 1,251 1,267 N/A 1,267 Acquisition-related Intangible Assets $ 25,010 $ ( 10,996 ) $ 14,014 $ 25,951 $ ( 10,973 ) $ 14,978 The estimated future amortization expense of acquisition-related intangible assets with definite lives is as follows: (In millions) 2020 $ 1,660 2021 1,552 2022 1,406 2023 1,329 2024 1,168 2025 and Thereafter 5,648 Estimated Future Amortization Expense of Definite-lived Intangible Assets $ 12,763 F-15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $ 1.71 billion, $ 1.74 billion and $ 1.59 billion in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Other Assets Other assets in the accompanying balance sheet include operating lease right-of-use assets, deferred tax assets, pension assets, cash surrender value of life insurance, insurance recovery receivables related to product liability matters, investments and other assets. Prior to January 1, 2018, investments for which there are not readily determinable market values were accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The company periodically evaluated the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, which provided that they are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Effective January 1, 2018, equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The company performs qualitative assessments to identify impairments of these investments. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the company had such investments with carrying amounts of $ 34 million and $ 36 million, respectively, which are included in other assets. Goodwill The company assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such events or circumstances generally include the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with one or more of the company’s reporting units. The company is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the goodwill impairment test is necessary. If the qualitative assessment results in a determination that the fair value of a reporting unit is more-likely-than-not less than its carrying amount, the company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The company may bypass the qualitative assessment for the reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the goodwill impairment test. The company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer market multiples. The company would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (limited to the amount of goodwill). The company determined that no impairments existed in 2019, 2018 or 2017. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as follows: (In millions) Life Sciences Solutions Analytical Instruments Specialty Diagnostics Laboratory Products and Services Total Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 8,391 $ 5,027 $ 3,856 $ 8,016 $ 25,290 Acquisitions 161 — — — 161 Finalization of purchase price allocations for 2017 acquisitions — 1 — 20 21 Currency translation ( 5 ) ( 77 ) ( 121 ) 79 ( 124 ) Other 1 ( 1 ) — ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 8,548 4,950 3,735 8,114 25,347 Acquisitions — 9 — 938 947 Finalization of purchase price allocations for 2018 acquisitions ( 2 ) — — — ( 2 ) Sale of business — — ( 478 ) — ( 478 ) Currency translation ( 3 ) ( 38 ) ( 72 ) 11 ( 102 ) Other 1 7 ( 1 ) ( 5 ) 2 Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 8,544 $ 4,928 $ 3,184 $ 9,058 $ 25,714 Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records F-16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at fair value and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition. Currency Translation All assets and liabilities of the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated at period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Currency transaction gains (losses) are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were $ 52 million, $ 19 million and $( 31 ) million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Derivative Contracts The company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings. The company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Swiss franc, euro, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen and Czech koruna. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. Cash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Fair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings. Net investment hedges. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The majority of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify the interaction of the accounting for certain equity securities, equity method investments, and certain forward contracts and purchased options. Among other things, the new guidance clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying measurement principles for certain equity securities immediately before applying or discontinuing the equity method. The company expects to adopt this guidance in 2020 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. Among other things, the new guidance requires the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates to be reflected in the annual effective tax rate F-17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The company expects to adopt this guidance when it is effective in 2021 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future events or conditions that would be affected such as enacted changes in tax laws or rates. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The company will adopt the guidance in 2020 using a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The company will adopt the guidance in 2020 with some items requiring a prospective method and others requiring a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In February 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to allow reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive items (AOCI) to retained earnings for certain tax effects on items within AOCI resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). The company adopted this guidance in January 2018 and recorded the reclassifications in the period of adoption. The balance sheet impact of adopting this guidance is included in the table below. This guidance only relates to the effects of the Tax Act. For all other tax law changes that have occurred or may occur in the future, the company reclassifies the tax effects to the consolidated statement of income on an item-by-item basis when the pre-tax item in AOCI is reclassified to income. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued guidance to address the application of accounting guidance in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017. The company reported provisional amounts in its 2017 financial statements for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act for which a reasonable estimate could be determined. Adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period, which ended December 22, 2018, are included as adjustments to Provision for Income Taxes in 2018 (Note 8). In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance. Among other things, the new guidance will permit more hedging strategies to qualify for hedge accounting, allow for additional time to perform an initial assessment of a hedge’s effectiveness, and permit a qualitative effectiveness test for certain hedges after initial qualification. The company adopted this guidance in January 2018. The balance sheet impact of adopting this guidance is included in the table below. In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance eliminating the deferral of the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers. The impact of this guidance in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future asset transfers which usually occur in connection with planning around acquisitions and other business structuring activities. The balance sheet impact of adopting this guidance as of January 1, 2018 is included in the table below. In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to require a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis, such as accounts receivable, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. During 2018 and 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company will adopt the guidance in 2020 using a modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities, initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments, with corresponding right-of-use assets. The new guidance also sets forth new disclosure requirements related to leases. During 2017 - 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company adopted this guidance in January 2019. The company elected to adopt the guidance using a modified retrospective method, by applying the transition approach as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Comparative periods have not been restated. As permitted upon transition, the company did not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts were or contained embedded leases, the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, initial direct costs for any leases, or whether land easements met the definition of a lease if they were not accounted for as leases under the prior guidance. Adoption of the new guidance impacted the company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: F-18 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In millions) December 31, 2018 as Reported Impact of Adopting New Lease Guidance January 1, 2019 As Adopted Other Assets $ 1,117 $ 641 $ 1,758 Other Accrued Expenses 1,470 132 1,602 Other Long-term Liabilities 2,515 505 3,020 Retained Earnings 18,696 4 18,700 In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. This guidance requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with subsequent changes recognized in net income, except for those accounted for under the equity method or requiring consolidation. The guidance also changes the accounting for investments without a readily determinable fair value and that do not qualify for the practical expedient permitted by the guidance to estimate fair value. The balance sheet impact of adopting this guidance as of January 1, 2018 is included in the table below. In May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most previous revenue recognition guidance. The new standard also requires significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity's nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. During 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification, including the elimination of certain SEC Staff Guidance. The guidance is effective for the company in 2018. The company elected to adopt this guidance through application of the modified retrospective method by applying it to contracts that were not completed as of December 31, 2017 (in addition to new contracts in 2018). Adoption of new guidance that became effective on January 1, 2018, impacted the company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: (In millions) December 31, 2017 as Reported Impact of Adopting New Revenue Guidance Impact of Adopting New Equity Investment Guidance Impact of Adopting New Intra-entity Tax Guidance Impact of Adopting New Hedge Accounting Guidance Impact of Adopting New Tax Effects on Items in AOCI Guidance January 1, 2018 as Adopted Accounts Receivable, Less Allowances $ 3,879 $ ( 8 ) $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 3,871 Inventories 2,971 ( 252 ) — — — — 2,719 Other Current Assets 1,236 229 — — — — 1,465 Other Assets 1,227 18 — ( 77 ) — — 1,168 Deferred Revenue 719 ( 719 ) — — — — — Contract Liabilities — 736 — — — — 736 Other Accrued Expenses 1,848 ( 153 ) — — — — 1,695 Deferred Income Taxes 2,766 — — ( 57 ) — 2 2,711 Other Long-term Liabilities 2,569 74 — — — — 2,643 Long-term Obligations 18,873 — — — ( 3 ) — 18,870 Retained Earnings 15,914 49 ( 1 ) ( 20 ) 3 87 16,032 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items ( 2,003 ) — 1 — — ( 89 ) ( 2,091 ) Had the company continued to use the revenue recognition guidance in effect prior to 2018, no material changes would have resulted to the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 from am ounts reported therein. However, inventories would have b een $ 357 million higher and other current assets would have been $ 359 million lower as of December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of differences in the accounting for pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services under the new revenue guidance. Under the prior guidance, costs of these services were recorded in inventory and revenues were recognized generally when the products were delivered to customers. Under the new guidance, costs are expensed and revenues are recognized as the manufacturing service is performed and the company's rights to consideration are recorded as contract assets. F-19 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. 2019 On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $ 1.67 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expands the segment’s contract manufacturing capabilities. Brammer Bio reported revenues of approximately $ 140 million in 2018. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $ 938 million was allocated to goodwill, $ 405 million of which is tax deductible. In addition, in 2019 the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a Slovakia-based provider of mass spectrometry software used for identification of compounds, and, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 169 million. The components of the purchase price and net assets acquired for 2019 acquisitions are as follows: (In millions) Brammer Bio Other Total Purchase Price Cash paid $ 1,710 $ 169 $ 1,879 Cash acquired ( 36 ) — ( 36 ) $ 1,674 $ 169 $ 1,843 Net Assets Acquired Current assets $ 52 $ 58 $ 110 Property, plant and equipment 147 102 249 Definite-lived intangible assets: Customer relationships 744 — 744 Product technology 65 7 72 Tradenames 7 — 7 Goodwill 938 9 947 Other assets 49 — 49 Contract liabilities ( 110 ) — ( 110 ) Deferred tax liabilities ( 110 ) ( 6 ) ( 116 ) Other liabilities assumed ( 108 ) ( 1 ) ( 109 ) $ 1,674 $ 169 $ 1,843 T he weighted-average amortization periods for definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2019 are 14 years for customer relationships, 13 years for product technology and 2 years for tradenames. The weighted average amortization period for all definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2019 is 14 years. 2018 On October 25, 2018, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Becton Dickinson and Company's Advanced Bioprocessing business for $ 477 million in cash. This North America-based business adds complementary cell culture products that expand the segment’s bioproduction offerings to help customers increase yield during production of biologic drugs. The Advanced Bioprocessing business reported revenues of $ 100 million in 2017. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $ 146 million was allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible. F-20 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In 2018, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, a North America-based provider of a rapid DNA platform for use in forensics and law enforcement applications, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 65 million.

The weighted average amortization period for all definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2018 is 13 years. 2017 On August 29, 2017, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Patheon N.V., a leading global provider of high-quality drug development and delivery solutions to the pharmaceutical and biopharma sectors, for $ 35.00 per share in cash, or $ 7.36 billion, including the assumption of net debt. The company financed the purchase price, including the repayment of indebtedness of Patheon, with issuances of debt and equity. Patheon provides comprehensive, integrated and highly customizable solutions as well as the expertise to help biopharmaceutical companies of all sizes satisfy complex development and manufacturing needs. The acquisition provided entry into the pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization market and added a complementary service to the company’s existing pharmaceutical services portfolio. Patheon reported revenues of $ 1.87 billion for the year ended October 31, 2016. The purchase price exceeded the fair market value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $ 3.28 billion was allocated to goodwill, $ 125 million of which is tax deductible. In addition, in 2017 the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a North America-based provider of cloud-based platforms supporting scientific data management; within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, a North America-based developer of scalable control automation systems and software for bioproduction; within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, a North America-based molecular diagnostics company offering qPCR tests to the transplant community; and within the Analytical Instruments segment, a provider of desktop scanning electron microscopy solutions and a manufacturer of volatile organic compound monitoring instruments and integrated systems, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 425 million.

Unaudited Pro Forma Information The following unaudited pro forma information provides the effect of the company's 2017 acquisition of Patheon as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2016: (In millions) 2017 Revenues $ 22,144 Net Income $ 2,258 To reflect the acquisition of Patheon as if it had occurred on January 1, 2016, the unaudited pro forma results include adjustments to reflect, among other things, the incremental intangible asset amortization to be incurred based on the preliminary values of each identifiable intangible asset and the interest expense from debt financings obtained to partially fund the cash consideration transferred. Pro forma adjustments were tax effected at the company's historical statutory rates in effect for the respective periods. The unaudited pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the combined results of operations that would have been realized had the acquisition and related financings occurred on the aforementioned date, nor are they meant to be indicative of any anticipated combined results of operations that the company will experience after the transaction. In addition, the amounts do not include any adjustments for actions that may be taken following the completion of the transaction, such as expected cost savings, operating synergies, or revenue enhancements that may be realized subsequent to the transaction. Pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2017, excludes certain items associated with the Patheon acquisition that were included in the determination of net income for that period. These items have been included in the determination of pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 (not presented), and are as follows: $ 54 million F-22 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

F-26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 6. Stock-based Compensation Expense The company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others. These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, stock options or performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the company’s Board of Directors or, for certain non-officer grants, by the company’s employee equity committee, which consists of its chief executive officer. The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises and restricted unit vestings. Grants of stock options and restricted units generally provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option or unit holder’s employment, all options and service-based restricted unit awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment). Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier. S tock-based compensation expense is primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses. (In millions) 2019 2018 2017 Stock-based Compensation Expense $ 181 $ 181 $ 159 Stock Options The company’s practice is to grant stock options at fair market value. Options vest over 3 - 5 years with terms of 7 - 10 years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions. Vesting of the option awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions. The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing the company’s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures. The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows: 2019 2018 2017 Expected Stock Price Volatility 21 % 20 % 20 % Risk Free Interest Rate 2.4 % 2.6 % 1.9 % Expected Life of Options (years) 4.3 4.3 4.3 Expected Annual Dividend 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.4 % The weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted during 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $ 53.37 , $ 43.45 and $ 30.73 , respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $ 320 million, $ 312 million and $ 199 million, respectively. The intrinsic value is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the option. F-27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A summary of the company’s option activity for the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented below: Shares (in millions) Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (a) (in millions) Outstanding at December 31, 2018 8.0 $ 148.09 Granted 1.3 256.61 Exercised ( 2.0 ) 111.13 Canceled/Expired ( 0.4 ) 193.78 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 6.9 $ 176.26 4.1 Vested and Unvested Expected to Vest at December 31, 2019 6.6 $ 174.33 4.1 $ 992 Exercisable at December 31, 2019 3.1 $ 141.20 2.9 $ 561 As of December 31, 2019, there was $ 95 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2023 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.2 years. Restricted Share/Unit Awards Awards of restricted units convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The awards generally vest over 3 - 4 years, assuming continued employment, with some exceptions. Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions. The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period. Recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to accrue dividend equivalents. The fair value of service- and performance-based restricted unit awards is determined based on the number of units granted and the market value of the company’s shares on the grant date. For awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the award. A summary of the company’s restricted unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented below: Units (in millions) Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2018 1.2 $ 177.04 Granted 0.6 248.10 Vested ( 0.7 ) 173.61 Forfeited ( 0.1 ) 198.73 Unvested at December 31, 2019 1.0 $ 218.34 The total fair value of shares vested during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $ 118 million, $ 114 million and $ 97 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, there was $ 141 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock unit awards. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2023 with a weighted average amortization period of 1.9 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plans Qualifying employees are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan sponsored by the company. Shares may be purchased under the program at 95 % of the fair market value at the end of the purchase period and the shares purchased are not subject to a holding period. Shares are purchased through payroll deductions of up to 10 % of each participating F-28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) employee’s qualifying gross wages. The company issued 0.2 million, 0.1 million and 0.1 million shares, respectively, of its common stock in 2019, 2018 and 2017 under the employee stock purchase plan. Note 7. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 401(k) Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans The company’s 401(k) savings and other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company’s eligible U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees. Contributions to the plans are made by both the employee and the company. Company contributions are based on the level of employee contributions. Company contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, the company charged to expense $ 232 million, $ 204 million and $ 161 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution plans. Defined Benefit Pension Plans Employees of a number of the company’s non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries. Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws. The company also maintains postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses where certain employees are eligible to participate. The costs of the postretirement healthcare programs are generally funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis. The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive items, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive items is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost. When a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits. The company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the company made cash contributions of approximately $ 50 million, $ 93 million and $ 200 million, respectively. Contributions to the plans included in the following table are estimated at between $ 40 and $ 60 million for 2020. F-29 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations. The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan. The company utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot-rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance. In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks. Asset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements. The expected rate of compensation increase reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on historic salary increase experience and management’s expectations of future salary increases. The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive items expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost in 2020 are not material. F-31 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company’s qualified and non-qualified pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows: Pension Plans (In millions) 2019 2018 Pension Plans with Projected Benefit Obligations in Excess of Plan Assets Projected benefit obligation $ 2,072 $ 1,876 Fair value of plan assets 1,557 1,421 The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company's qualified and non-qualified pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows: Pension Plans (In millions) 2019 2018 Pension Plans with Accumulated Benefit Obligations in Excess of Plan Assets Accumulated benefit obligation $ 1,976 $ 1,792 Fair value of plan assets 1,525 1,393 The measurement date used to determine benefit information is December 31 for all plan assets and benefit obligations.

Benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels, average years employed and average life spans, among other factors, and changes in any of these factors could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments. Estimated future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows: (In millions) Domestic Pension Benefits Non-U.S. Pension Benefits Post- retirement Benefits Expected Benefit Payments 2020 $ 90 $ 34 $ 2 2021 90 37 2 2022 87 38 2 2023 86 41 2 2024 85 45 2 2025-2029 390 250 8 A change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point effective January 2019 would not have caused a material change in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 and the 2019 aggregate of service and interest costs.

The company invests in a portfolio of both return-seeking and liability-hedging assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth and to insulate the funded position from interest rate volatility. The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities. The target allocations for the investments are approximately 10 % to funds investing in U.S. equities, approximately 10 % to funds investing in international equities and approximately 80 % to funds investing in fixed income securities. The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments. Non-U.S. Pension Plan Assets The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S. The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans. Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies. When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers. The investments may include equity funds, fixed income funds, hedge funds, multi-asset funds, alternative investments and derivative funds with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 0 % - 25 % for equity funds, 0 % - 70 % for fixed income funds, 0 % - 20 % for hedge funds, 0 % - 100 % for multi-asset funds, 0 % to 5 % for alternative investments and 0 % - 30 % for funds holding derivatives. The derivatives held by the funds are primarily interest rate swaps intended to match the movements in the plan liabilities as well as equity futures in a synthetic equity fund which provide targeted exposure to equity markets without the fund holding individual equity positions. Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments. The fair values of the company’s plan assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, by asset category are as follows: December 31, Quoted Prices in Active Markets Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs Not Subject to Leveling (1) (In millions) 2019 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Domestic Pension Plan Assets U.S. equity funds $ 122 $ — $ — $ — $ 122 International equity funds 116 — — — 116 Fixed income funds 951 — — — 951 Money market funds 12 — — — 12 Total Domestic Pension Plans $ 1,201 $ — $ — $ — $ 1,201 Non-U.S. Pension Plan Assets Equity funds $ 37 $ — $ — $ — $ 37 Fixed income funds 430 — — — 430 Hedge funds 61 — — — 61 Multi-asset funds 76 — — — 76 Derivative funds 129 — — — 129 Alternative investments 4 — — — 4 Insurance contracts 237 — 237 — — Cash / money market funds 12 9 — — 3 Total Non-U.S. Pension Plans $ 986 $ 9 $ 237 $ — $ 740 (1) Investments measured at the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

U.S. Tax Reform Impacts On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted. The Tax Act includes significant changes to existing U.S. tax laws that affect the company, including a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % beginning in 2018 and creation of a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries (transition tax). As detailed below, the company recognized a net charge of $ 204 million for certain aspects of the Tax Act in its 2017 financial statements for which the accounting was provisional, but a reasonable F-35 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) estimate could be determined. During 2018, the company completed its accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recognized net adjustments (detailed below) to the provisional amounts, totaling a net charge of $ 68 million, as a component of income tax expense. The transition tax is based on the company's total post-1986 earnings and profits, the tax on which was previously deferred from U.S. income taxes under U.S. law. The company recorded a provisional amount for the transition tax liability for each of the foreign subsidiaries, resulting in a total transition liability of $ 1.25 billion at December 31, 2017. After further analysis of new U.S. Treasury guidance, available tax accounting methods and elections, legislative updates, regulations, earnings and profits computations and foreign taxes, the company finalized the calculations of the transition tax liability during 2018. The increase in the liability for the transition tax in 2018 consisted of an incremental provision of $ 117 million offset in part by a $ 49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. In 2017, as a result of the Tax Act, the company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future (which was generally 21 %), by recording a provisional tax benefit of $ 1.06 billion. During 2018, no material changes to this provisional amount were made. The Tax Act included a provision for global intangible low-taxed income. The company has adopted a policy to account for this provision as a period cost. During 2019, the company recorded a net tax provision of $ 1 million to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform based on final regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in 2019. The income tax provision consists of an incremental charge of $ 8 million offset by a $ 7 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits. Other Tax Impacts In 2019, the company recorded a $ 62 million income tax benefit, including both U.S. federal and state taxes, related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements as well as a tax provision of $ 191 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. Also in 2019, the company recorded a $ 79 million benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intra-entity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable. In 2018, the provision for income taxes also included a $ 71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the 2019 sale of the Anatomical Pathology business (Note 2). The foreign tax credits discussed below are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. In 2019, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $ 75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In 2017, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefited from U.S. foreign tax credits of $ 86 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $ 53 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017). The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $ 20 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In 2017, the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $ 237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes. The company generally receives a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees, or the vesting of restricted stock units held by employees, for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise. The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization of tax attributes. These excess tax benefits reduce the tax provision. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, the company's tax provision was reduced by $ 80 million, $ 77 million and $ 65 million, respectively, of such benefits. F-36 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Net deferred tax asset (liability) in the accompanying balance sheet consists of the following: (In millions) 2019 2018 Deferred Tax Asset (Liability) Depreciation and amortization $ ( 3,084 ) $ ( 3,444 ) Net operating loss and credit carryforwards 1,231 1,311 Reserves and accruals 144 148 Accrued compensation 261 250 Inventory basis difference 99 105 Other capitalized costs 71 103 Unrealized losses on hedging instruments 10 23 Other, net 57 143 Deferred tax assets (liabilities), net before valuation allowance ( 1,211 ) ( 1,361 ) Less: Valuation allowance 408 471 Deferred tax assets (liabilities), net $ ( 1,619 ) $ ( 1,832 ) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not expire unutilized. At December 31, 2019, all of the company’s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets, primarily net operating losses, for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense. The changes in the valuation allowance are as follows: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2019 2018 2017 Beginning Balance $ 471 $ 256 $ 113 (Reductions) additions charged to income tax provision, net ( 27 ) 223 28 Additions due to acquisitions — 17 108 Reduction due to a divestiture ( 33 ) — — Deductions — ( 15 ) — Currency translation and other ( 3 ) ( 10 ) 7 Ending Balance $ 408 $ 471 $ 256 At December 31, 2019, the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $ 282 million, $ 1.73 billion and $ 4.82 billion, respectively. Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2020 through 2039. Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $ 1.98 billion expire in the years 2024 through 2039, and the remainder do not expire. As a result of the Tax Act, U.S. federal taxes have been recorded on $ 15 billion of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2019. A provision has not been made for certain U.S. state income taxes or additional non-U.S. taxes that would be due when cash is repatriated to the U.S. as the company’s undistributed foreign earnings are intended to be reinvested outside of the U.S. indefinitely. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable due to the uncertainty in the manner in which these earnings will be distributed. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax cost. Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of December 31, 2019, the company had $ 1.55 billion of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate. F-37 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: (In millions) 2019 2018 2017 Beginning Balance $ 1,442 $ 1,409 $ 802 Additions due to acquisitions — — 31 Reductions due to acquisitions — ( 5 ) — Additions for tax positions of current year 53 48 565 Additions for tax positions of prior years 69 82 51 Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 7 ) — — Closure of tax years — ( 5 ) — Settlements ( 5 ) ( 87 ) ( 40 ) Ending Balance $ 1,552 $ 1,442 $ 1,409 Substantially all of the total $ 1.55 billion liability is classified as a long-term liability. The company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months. During 2019, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits increased $ 70 million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and $ 45 million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions. During 2018, the company's unrecognized tax benefits increased $ 85 million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and $ 45 million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions. During 2017, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits provisionally increased $ 511 million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to the scope of the Tax Act’s one-time transition tax, $ 54 million relating to foreign tax positions, $ 43 million as a result of a foreign exchange loss recognized on the refinancing of certain long term inter-company debt and $ 31 million due to an acquisition. The company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $ 67 million and $ 59 million, respectively. The company conducts business globally and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S., income tax examinations for years before 2011. F-38 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) As of December 31, 2019, the annual repayment requirements for debt obligations are as follows: (In millions) 2020 $ 676 2021 4 2022 564 2023 1,001 2024 2,122 2025 and Thereafter 13,593 $ 17,960 As of December 31, 2018, short-term obligations and current maturities of long-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet included $ 693 million of commercial paper, short-term bank borrowings and borrowings under lines of credit of certain of the company’s subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate for short-term borrowings was 0.74 % at December 31, 2018. No such borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2019. In addition to available borrowings under the company’s revolving credit agreements, discussed below, the company had unused lines of credit of $ 62 million as of December 31, 2019. These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates. Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides for up to $ 2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The facility expires in July 2021. The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $ 72 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under these programs. Senior Notes Interest on the floating rate senior notes is payable quarterly. Interest is payable annually on the other euro-denominated senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. In 2019, the company refinanced certain of its debt by issuing new senior notes and using the proceeds to redeem some of its existing senior notes. In connection with these redemptions, the company incurred $ 184 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in Other Expense, Net on the accompanying statement of income. Upon redemption of the senior notes, the company terminated the related fixed to floating rate interest rate swap arrangements and paid $ 17 million, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. The company also terminated related F-41 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements and received $ 44 million, included in other investing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. In 2018, Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 included in the table above. This subsidiary has no independent function other than financing activities. The Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company and no other subsidiaries of the company have guaranteed the obligations. Interest Rate Swap Arrangements The company has entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks. The aggregate amounts of the swaps are equal to the principal amount of the notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the interest payment dates of the note. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate and receive a fixed rate. The variable interest rates reset monthly. The swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges of the notes. See Note 14 for additional information on the interest rate swap arrangements and related cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements. The following table summarizes the outstanding interest rate swap arrangements on the company's senior notes at December 31, 2019: Aggregate Notional Amount Pay Rate as of (Dollars in millions) Pay Rate December 31, 2019 Receive Rate 3.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (a) $ 1,000 1-month LIBOR + 1.7640 % 3.5038 % 3.00 % (a) The payments on $ 900 million notional value of these interest rate swaps are offset in part by cross-currency interest rate swaps which effectively reduced the pay rate as of December 31, 2019 from a weighted average of 3.50 % to a weighted average of 1.14 %. The company entered into $ 900 million notional value of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which effectively convert a portion of the semi-annual payments related to the variable rate, U.S. dollar denominated, LIBOR-based interest rate swaps to payments on variable rate, euro denominated, EURIBOR-based cross-currency interest rate swaps. Note 11. Leases As a lessee, the company leases certain logistics, office, and manufacturing facilities, as well as vehicles, copiers, and other equipment. These operating leases generally have remaining lease terms between 1 month and 30 years, and some include options to extend (generally for 1 to 10 years) or have options to terminate the arrangement within 1 year. The company’s finance leases are not material. The company has guaranteed the residual value of three leased operating facilities with lease terms ending in 2020, 2023 and 2024. The company has agreed with the lessor to comply with certain financial covenants consistent with its other debt arrangements (Note 10). The aggregate maximum guarantee under these three lease arrangements is $ 147 million. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities for these lease arrangements are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019, but exclude any amounts for residual value guarantees. As a lessee, the consolidated statement of income includes pre-tax operating lease costs of $ 208 million and pre-tax variable lease costs of $ 41 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Lease costs arising from finance leases, short-term leases, and sublease income are not material. Cash used in operating activities for payments of amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $ 208 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating lease ROU assets of $ 205 million were obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2019. The weighted-average remaining operating lease term was 6.2 years and the weighted average discount rate was 4.0 % as of December 31, 2019. ROU assets of $ 699 million as of December 31, 2019, are classified in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities of $ 167 million and $ 571 million as of December 31, 2019, are classified in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet. F-42 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) As of December 31, 2019, future payments of operating lease liabilities are as follows: (In millions) 2020 $ 197 2021 158 2022 124 2023 92 2024 68 2025 and Thereafter 197 Total Lease Payments 836 Less: Imputed Interest 98 Total Operating Lease Liability $ 738 As a lessor, operating leases, sales-type leases and direct financing leases are not material. As previously disclosed in the company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and under previous lease accounting guidance, income from continuing operations includes expense from operating leases of $ 211 million and $ 198 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the following is a summary of annual future minimum lease and rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2018: (In millions) 2019 $ 192 2020 158 2021 118 2022 86 2023 58 2024 and Thereafter 177 $ 789 Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Obligations The company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. The aggregate amount of the company’s unconditional purchase obligations totaled $ 1.20 billion at December 31, 2019 and the majority of these obligations are expected to be settled during 2020. Letters of Credit, Guarantees and Other Commitments Outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $ 272 million at December 31, 2019. Substantially all of these letters of credit and guarantees expire before 2026. Outstanding surety bonds and other guarantees totaled $ 61 million at December 31, 2019. The expiration of these bonds and guarantees ranges through 2022. The letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds principally secure performance obligations, and allow the holder to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit, bank guarantee or surety bond if the applicable business unit does not perform as contractually required. The company is a guarantor of pension plan obligations of a divested business. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2019 was $ 41 million. F-43 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with respect to those assumed liabilities. In the event a third-party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be liable to the third-party for such obligations. However, in such event, the company would be entitled to seek indemnification from the buyer. Indemnifications In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities). The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction. Where probable, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications. In connection with the company’s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties. When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility. As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement. The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position or results of operations. In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement. The company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions. Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including input from environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. At December 31, 2019, the company’s total environmental liability was approximately $ 66 million. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company including matters involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters. A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred. The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible F-44 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed below, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company’s continuing operations at December 31, 2019, was approximately $ 206 million to $ 342 million on an undiscounted basis. The portion of these liabilities assumed in the 2006 merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present) value at the date of merger. The company’s accrual for all such matters in total, including the discounted liabilities, was $ 198 million at December 31, 2019 (or $ 215 million undiscounted). The accrual includes estimated defense costs and is gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $ 84 million at December 31, 2019 (or $ 96 million undiscounted) that are included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. The portion of these insurance assets assumed in the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at the date of merger. In addition to the above accrual, as of December 31, 2019, the company had a product liability accrual of $ 9 million (undiscounted) relating to divested businesses. The assets and liabilities assumed at the Fisher merger date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted average discount rate of 4.67 %). The discount on the liabilities of approximately $ 17 million and the discount on the assets of approximately $ 12 million (net discount $ 5 million) are being accreted to interest expense over the expected settlement period. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. Intellectual Property Matters On June 3, 2013, Unisone Strategic IP filed a complaint against Life Technologies, a subsidiary of the company, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California alleging patent infringement by Life Technologies’ supply chain management system software, which operates with product “supply centers” installed at customer sites. Plaintiff seeks damages for alleged willful infringement, attorneys’ fees, costs, and injunctive relief. On August 24, 2017, Unisone filed an appeal from a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) that found the challenged patent claims invalid. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the PTAB’s ruling finding the challenged claims in the Unisone patent invalid. Unisone had until March 11, 2019 to file an appeal with the United States Supreme Court. Unisone did not appeal that decision, and consequently the case before the United States District Court, which had been stayed pending the outcome of the PTAB decision, resumed with Unisone filing an amended complaint on September 12, 2019 regarding similar patent claims that were not included in the PTAB proceeding. On November 1, 2019, Life Technologies filed two additional covered business method (CBM) challenges with the PTAB regarding Unisone’s new patent claims. On December 16, 2019, the United States District Court granted Life Technologies’ motion to stay the case pending the PTAB’s decision whether to institute a CBM review of the new patent claims. Note 13. Comprehensive Income and Shareholders' Equity Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income combines net income and other comprehensive items. Other comprehensive items represent certain amounts that are reported as components of shareholders’ equity in the accompanying balance sheet. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recorded an out of period adjustment to correct an error in the accounting for income taxes associated with the partial hedge of its net investment in a foreign operation in 2014 through the third quarter of 2017. The adjustment affected deferred income taxes and other comprehensive income and, in the aggregate, increased comprehensive income by $ 101 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The adjustment does not have any impact on the F-45 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) company’s statements of income or cash flows. The company determined that the adjustment was not material to the consolidated financial statements for any previously reported annual or interim periods. Changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net of tax are as follows: (In millions) Currency Translation Adjustment Unrealized Losses on Hedging Instruments Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Liability Adjustment Total Balance at December 31, 2018 $ ( 2,243 ) $ ( 52 ) $ ( 203 ) $ ( 2,498 ) Other comprehensive items before reclassifications ( 107 ) ( 38 ) ( 93 ) ( 238 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive items 30 19 8 57 Net other comprehensive items ( 77 ) ( 19 ) ( 85 ) ( 181 ) Balance at December 31, 2019 $ ( 2,320 ) $ ( 71 ) $ ( 288 ) $ ( 2,679 ) Shareholders’ Equity At December 31, 2019, the company had reserved 25 million unissued shares of its common stock for possible issuance under stock-based compensation plans. Note 14. Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements The company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during 2019. The company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of insurance contracts, investments in derivative contracts, mutual funds holding publicly traded securities and other investments in unit trusts held as assets to satisfy outstanding deferred compensation and retirement liabilities; and acquisition-related contingent consideration. The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access. Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data. F-46 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following tables present information about the company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018: December 31, Quoted Prices in Active Markets Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs (In millions) 2019 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets Cash equivalents $ 1,280 $ 1,280 $ — $ — Investments in common stock, mutual funds and other similar instruments 19 19 — — Warrants 6 — 6 — Insurance contracts 131 — 131 — Derivative contracts 37 — 37 — Total Assets $ 1,473 $ 1,299 $ 174 $ — Liabilities Derivative contracts $ 24 $ — $ 24 $ — Contingent consideration 55 — — 55 Total Liabilities $ 79 $ — $ 24 $ 55 December 31, Quoted Prices in Active Markets Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs (In millions) 2018 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets Cash equivalents $ 769 $ 769 $ — $ — Bank time deposits 2 2 — — Investments in mutual funds and other similar instruments 10 10 — — Warrants 8 — 8 — Insurance contracts 113 — 113 — Derivative contracts 31 — 31 — Total Assets $ 933 $ 781 $ 152 $ — Liabilities Derivative contracts $ 145 $ — $ 145 $ — Contingent consideration 37 — — 37 Total Liabilities $ 182 $ — $ 145 $ 37 The company uses the Black-Scholes model to value its warrants. The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with such future payments. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs, of the contingent consideration. F-47 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The majority of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. See Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information on the company's risk management objectives and strategies. Cash Flow Hedge Arrangements In 2019, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to the completion of debt offerings. Based on the company's conclusion that the debt offerings were probable, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the interest payments on € 1.80 billion plus $ 900 million aggregate principal amounts of the planned fixed-rate debt issues. The hedges were terminated in 2019, in connection with the debt offerings. The aggregate fair value of the hedges at that time, $ 38 million, net of tax, has been classified as a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive items and will be amortized to interest expense over the terms of the related debt issuances. The company had a cash outlay of $ 50 million in 2019 associated with termination of the arrangements, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows.

Note 16. Restructuring and Other Costs (Income), Net Restructuring and other costs (income), net, in 2019 primarily included the gain on the sale of the company’s Anatomical Pathology business, and, to a lesser extent, transaction/integration costs related to acquisitions and a divestiture; sales of inventory revalued at the date of acquisition; and continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including the closure and consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S. and Europe. In 2019, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected approximately 1 % of the company’s workforce. Restructuring and other costs in 2018 included continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including the closure and consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S. and Europe; third-party transaction/integration costs primarily related to recent acquisitions; sales of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; and environmental remediation charges. These charges were partially offset by gains on sales of real estate and favorable results of litigation. In 2018, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected approximately 1 % of the company’s workforce. F-50 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Restructuring and other costs in 2017 included continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including the closure and consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia; costs to achieve synergies related to acquisitions, including severance and abandoned facility costs; third-party acquisition transaction and integration costs primarily associated with the acquisitions of FEI and Patheon; sales of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; charges to conform the accounting policies of Patheon to the company's accounting policies; charges for changes in estimates of acquisition contingent consideration; hurricane response/impairment costs; net charges for the settlement/curtailment of retirement plans; and net credits for litigation matters. In 2017, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected less than 2 % of the company’s workforce. As of February 26, 2020, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $ 65 million, primarily in 2020, and expects to identify additional actions during 2020 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred. 2019 During 2019, the company recorded net restructuring and other costs by segment as follows: (In millions) Cost of Revenues Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Restructuring and Other Costs (Income), Net Total Life Sciences Solutions $ 16 $ — $ 24 $ 40 Analytical Instruments — 24 14 38 Specialty Diagnostics — 4 ( 471 ) ( 467 ) Laboratory Products and Services 1 35 17 53 Corporate — ( 1 ) 3 2 $ 17 $ 62 $ ( 413 ) $ ( 334 ) The principal components of net restructuring and other costs by segment are as follows: Life Sciences Solutions In 2019, the Life Sciences Solutions segment recorded $ 40 million of net restructuring and other charges, including $ 16 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sales of inventory revalued at the date of acquisition.

Analytical Instruments In 2019, the Analytical Instruments segment recorded $ 38 million of net restructuring and other charges, including $ 24 million of charges to selling, general, and administrative expense, principally third-party transaction costs related to the acquisition of Gatan, subsequently terminated. The segment also recorded $ 14 million of restructuring and other costs, primarily for employee severance and other costs associated with facility consolidations in the U.S. and Europe. Specialty Diagnostics In 2019, the Specialty Diagnostics segment recorded $ 467 million of net restructuring and other income, primarily a gain on the divestiture of its Anatomical Pathology business (see Note 2). The segment also recorded $ 4 million of charges to selling, general, and administrative expense, principally third-party transaction costs in connection with the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. Laboratory Products and Services In 2019, the Laboratory Products and Services segment recorded $ 53 million of net restructuring and other charges. The segment recorded charges to cost of revenues of $ 1 million to conform the accounting policies of recently acquired businesses with the company’s accounting policies and $ 35 million of charges to selling, general, and administrative expenses, principally third-party transaction/integration costs for recently completed acquisitions.

We have approximately 12,000 sales personnel including highly trained technical specialists who enable us to better meet the needs of our more technical end-users. We also provide customers with product standardization and other supply-chain-management services to reduce procurement costs. New Products and Research and Development Our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business segments. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position. Raw Materials Our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources. We do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business. Raw material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions. We employ many strategies, including the use of alternative materials, to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results. Patents, Licenses and Trademarks Patents are important in many aspects of our business. No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so important, however, that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest. Patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts. We protect some of our technology as trade secrets and, where appropriate, we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products. We also enter into license agreements with others to grant and/or receive rights to patents and know-how. Seasonal Influences Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. Sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s flu season. Sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s airborne pollen allergens. Working Capital Requirements There are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital. Dependency on a Single Customer There is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. No customer accounted for more than 5% of our total revenues in any of the past three years. 11 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Business (continued) Backlog Our backlog of firm orders at year-end 2018 and 2017 was as follows: (In millions) 2018 2017 Life Sciences Solutions $ 647 $ 581 Analytical Instruments 2,243 2,050 Specialty Diagnostics 187 158 Laboratory Products and Services 2,055 1,679 Eliminations (45 ) (20 ) $ 5,087 $ 4,448 We believe that approximately 90% of our backlog at the end of 2018 will be filled during 2019 . Government Contracts Although the company transacts business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results. Competition The company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve. Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors. Competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development. Our success primarily depends on the following factors: • technical performance and advances in technology that result in new products and improved price/performance ratios; • product differentiation, availability and reliability; • the depth of our capabilities; • our reputation among customers as a quality provider of products and services; • customer service and support; • active research and application-development programs; and • relative prices of our products and services. Environmental Matters We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements. A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. Our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters. Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material. For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial measures. 12 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Business (continued) Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984 to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites, and are currently under the State’s Licensed Site Remediation Professional Program. As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site, and, in 2008, the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to complete a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study. In 2018, the USEPA issued a Record of Decision, including the scope of required remediation work based on findings of this study. The company has indicated its willingness to finance and perform the required remediation work together with the other responsible parties. In 2011, our Life Technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the USEPA and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former Davis Landfill Superfund site in Smithfield, Rhode Island. We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters. We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $69 million at December 31, 2018 . These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled. We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur. As a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Regulatory Affairs Our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies. As Thermo Fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. Number of Employees We have approximately 70,000 employees. Available Information The company files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Exchange Act. The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information that issuers, including the company, file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at www.sec.gov. We also make available free of charge on or through our own website at www.thermofisher.com our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

Risk Factors Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in Item 1. Business under the caption ""Forward-looking Statements"". We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive. Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue. It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including: • strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; • allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; 14 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) • developing new applications for our technologies; • expanding our service offerings; • continuing key customer initiatives; • combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively; • finding new markets for our products; and • continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings. We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business. Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, are unstable, it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of • reducing demand for some of our products; • increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays; • increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; • increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services; • causing supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; and • creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds. Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies. Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget. An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending. Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations. International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the ""functional currency""). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. As our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In 2018 , currency translation had a favorable effect of $173 million on revenues due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: • interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; • changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions; • changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers; 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) • tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs recently adopted by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods; • negative consequences from changes in tax laws; • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; • differing labor regulations; • differing protection of intellectual property; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and • geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war. Significant developments stemming from the U.S. administration or the U.K.’s referendum on membership in the EU could have an adverse effect on us. The U.S. administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements and is imposing significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the United States. The administration has also indicated an intention to request Congress to make significant changes, replacement or elimination of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and government negotiation/regulation of drug prices paid by government programs. Changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the health care system and drug prices, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business. Additionally, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the European Union, or EU. This referendum has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years. Our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the United Kingdom’s referendum. In addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the United Kingdom. These possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the United Kingdom’s actual or threatened withdrawal from the EU, may adversely affect our operating results and our customers’ businesses. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products. Our pharma services offerings are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers, our business could suffer. Our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements. Our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our quality management strategy and systems, and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. A failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products. In each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether. In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such failure could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers for lost drug product, registered intermediates, registered starting materials, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, other customer claims, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. Production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high. If problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market, we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of which could be significant. We are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. We may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers. Additionally, products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company. Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business. Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $25.35 billion and $1.27 billion , respectively, as of December 31, 2018 . In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $13.71 billion as of December 31, 2018 . We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. We assess the 17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us. Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor. Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us. In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers. We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers. Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us. Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe. We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected. We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies. We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (the FDA), the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS), the European Medicines Agency (the EMA), in Europe, the EU member states and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale. The manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices and pharma services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. We are the sole manufacturer of a number of 18 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers' ability to provide products to their customers. We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad such as anti-corruption, anti-competition and privacy and data protection laws. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites. We rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products, pending sale. Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, hurricanes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business. We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk. Although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices. If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow. Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel. While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs. A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business. As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We also rely on our information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners) and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as interacting with suppliers, selling our products and services, fulfilling orders and billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers, tracking customer activity, fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise conducting business). Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, phishing, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results. Any of the cyber-attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above, if significant, could materially interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business 19 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) consequences. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe, and the recently-enacted EU General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in May 2018, imposes significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data. Several countries, such as China and Russia, have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. Our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities. As of December 31, 2018 , we had approximately $18.99 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments. Item 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , which begin on page F-1 of this report. Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into four business segments (see Note 4 ): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. Recent Acquisitions The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent acquisitions are described below. On March 31, 2016, the company acquired, primarily within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Affymetrix, Inc., a North America-based provider of cellular and genetic analysis products, for a total purchase price of $1.34 billion , net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $254 million of debt. The acquisition expanded the company's existing portfolio of antibodies and assays for flow cytometry and single-cell biology applications. Additionally, the acquisition expanded the company's genetic analysis portfolio through the addition of microarrays. Revenues of Affymetrix were $360 million in 2015. On September 19, 2016, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, FEI Company, a North America-based provider of high-performance electron microscopy, for a total purchase price of $4.08 billion , net of cash acquired. The acquisition strengthened the company's analytical instrument portfolio with the addition of high-end electron microscopes. Revenues of FEI were $930 million in 2015. On February 14, 2017, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Finesse Solutions, Inc., a North America-based developer of scalable control automation systems and software for bioproduction, for a total purchase price of $221 million , net of cash acquired. The acquisition expanded the company's bioproduction offerings. Revenues of Finesse Solutions were approximately $50 million in 2016 . On March 2, 2017, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, Core Informatics, a North America-based provider of cloud-based platforms supporting scientific data management, for a total purchase price of $94 million , net of cash acquired. The acquisition enhanced the company's existing informatics solutions. Revenues of Core Informatics were approximately $10 million in 2016. On August 29, 2017, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Patheon N.V., a leading global provider of high-quality drug development and delivery solutions to the pharmaceutical and biopharma sectors, for $35.00 per share in cash, or $7.36 billion , including the assumption of net debt. The company financed the purchase price, including the repayment of indebtedness of Patheon, with issuances of debt and equity. Patheon provides comprehensive, integrated and highly customizable solutions as well as the expertise to help biopharmaceutical companies of all sizes satisfy complex development and manufacturing needs. The acquisition provided entry into the pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization market and added a complementary service to the company's existing pharmaceutical services portfolio. Patheon's revenues totaled $1.87 billion for the year ended October 31, 2016. On October 25, 2018, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Becton Dickinson and Company's Advanced Bioprocessing business for $477 million in cash. This North America-based business adds complementary cell culture products that expand the segment's bioproduction offerings to help customers increase yield during production of biologic drugs. Revenues of the Advanced Bioprocessing business were $100 million in 2017. 24 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $ 6,269 25.7 % $ 5,728 27.4 % Analytical Instruments 5,469 22.5 % 4,821 23.0 % Specialty Diagnostics 3,724 15.3 % 3,486 16.7 % Laboratory Products and Services 10,035 41.2 % 7,825 37.4 % Eliminations (1,139 ) (4.7 )% (942 ) (4.5 )% $ 24,358 100 % $ 20,918 100 % Sales in 2018 were $24.36 billion , an increase of $3.44 billion from 2017 . Sales increased $1.53 billion due to acquisitions. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $173 million in 2018 . Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $1.74 billion ( 8% ) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew. Sales growth was strong in each of the company's primary geographic areas, particularly Asia. In 2018 , total company operating income and operating income margin were $3.78 billion and 15.5% , respectively, compared with $2.96 billion and 14.2% , respectively, in 2017 . The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by an increase in strategic growth investments, unfavorable sales mix and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, due to recent acquisitions. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. The company recorded a provision for income taxes in 2018 including a net provision of $68 million to adjust the estimated initial effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) recorded in 2017, consisting of an incremental provision of $117 million offset in part by a $49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. These adjustments were required based on new U.S. Treasury guidance and further analysis of available tax accounting methods and elections, legislative updates, regulations, earnings and profit computations and foreign taxes. In 2018, the provision for income taxes also included a $71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the planned sale of the Anatomical Pathology business (Note 2). The company recorded a provision for income taxes in 2017 principally due to a net provision of $204 million from the effects of the Tax Act consisting primarily of a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, net of a benefit from adjusting the deferred tax balances for the U.S. statutory tax rate reduction. In 2017, the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes. In addition, in 2017 the company recorded a $65 million favorable adjustment to deferred tax balances due to extension of a tax holiday agreement in Singapore. The company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries in 2017. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $86 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $53 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017) for a net benefit of $33 million. The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $20 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. , The effective tax rate in both 2018 and 2017 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for 25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $591 million and $479 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2019 will be between 7% and 10% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. Income from continuing operations increased to $2.94 billion in 2018 , from $2.23 billion in 2017 principally due to increase in operating income in 2018 (discussed above). During 2018 , the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $4.54 billion compared with $4.01 billion for 2017 . The increase primarily resulted from higher income before amortization and depreciation in the 2018 period, offset in part by higher investment in working capital to support sales growth. As of December 31, 2018 , the company’s short-term debt totaled $1.27 billion , including $693 million of commercial paper obligations and $573 million of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2018 , no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $82 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company expects to fund the acquisition of Gatan Inc. with a combination of existing cash balances and short-term borrowings. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $2.10 billion as of December 31, 2018 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and pension costs. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $13.71 billion at December 31, 2018 . The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. 26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $25.35 billion and $1.27 billion , respectively, at December 31, 2018 . Estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, discount rates and other factors. For the goodwill impairment tests, the company considers peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and estimated weighted average costs of capital. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. For reporting units where the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test, indications of fair value based on projections of profitability for 2019 and thereafter and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2018 , the date of the company’s impairment testing. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. With the completion of the Patheon acquisition in August 2017, the company established a new reporting unit, called Pharma Services, which solely consists of the legacy Patheon business, the book carrying value of which equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date. During its annual 2018 goodwill impairment assessment, the company determined that the Pharma Services reporting unit's cushion of fair value over book value had increased to 5%. Despite this favorable increase, given that the fair value of the reporting unit was not substantially in excess of its carrying value, relatively small decreases in future cash flows from anticipated results could result in impairment of goodwill. The key variables that drive the valuation of the reporting unit are revenue and operating income growth rate assumptions, peer revenue and earnings trading multiples, as well as the weighted average cost of capital rate applied. The estimates used for these assumptions represent management's best estimates, which the company believes are reasonable. These assumptions, however are subject to variability and uncertainty, including the degree to which the reporting unit will grow revenue and profitability levels. The Pharma Services reporting unit had $3.37 billion of goodwill, and an overall carrying value of $7.70 billion as of December 31, 2018. (b) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. The company’s liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled $1.44 billion at December 31, 2018 . The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income. 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which the company has been able to conclude that its deferred tax assets will be realized, it has generally relied on future reversals of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income where such estimates have historically been reliable, and other factors. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $471 million at December 31, 2018 . Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company has not provided state income or foreign withholding taxes on certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings, as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies. These business plans and tax strategies consider: short-term and long-term forecasts and budgets of the U.S. parent and non-U.S. subsidiaries; working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated; the company’s past practices regarding non-U.S. subsidiary dividends; sources of financing by the U.S. parent, such as issuing debt or equity; and uses of cash by the U.S. parent that are more discretionary in nature, such as business combinations and share repurchase programs. However, should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its U.S. subsidiaries, including cash maintained by these non-U.S. subsidiaries, the company would recognize additional tax liabilities. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional state and foreign withholding tax liabilities that the company would incur. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax costs. (c) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (d) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $22 million in 2018 . The company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $391 million at year-end 2018 compared with $486 million at year-end 2017 . Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $93 million . 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $1.53 billion due to acquisitions. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $173 million in 2018 . Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $1.74 billion ( 8% ) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew. Sales growth was strong in each of the company's primary geographic areas, particularly Asia. In 2018 , total company operating income and operating income margin were $3.78 billion and 15.5% , respectively, compared with $2.96 billion and 14.2% , respectively, in 2017 . The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by an increase in strategic growth investments, unfavorable sales mix and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, due to recent acquisitions. In 2018 , the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $91 million , including $12 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company recorded $29 million of net charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally third-party transaction and integration costs associated with recent and pending acquisitions, offset in part by income from the favorable results of product liability litigation. In addition, the company recorded $88 million of cash restructuring costs in its continuing effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S. and Europe. The company also recorded $38 million of other income, net, principally for resolution of a litigation matter (see Note 15 ). In 2017 , the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $298 million , including $123 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, to conform the accounting policies of Patheon to the company's accounting policies; $78 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs associated with recent acquisitions and changes in estimates of acquisition contingent consideration. In addition, the company recorded $97 million of cash restructuring costs, primarily to achieve acquisition synergies, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe. The company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company also recorded $27 million of net credits for litigation-related matters, which were mostly offset by compensation due at Patheon on the date of acquisition, hurricane response/impairment costs, and net charges for the settlement/curtailment of retirement plans. As of February 27, 2019 , the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $65 million , primarily in 2019 , and expects to identify additional actions during 2019 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements and abandonment of leased facilities. Approximately 40% of the additional charges will be incurred in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, 25% in the Analytical Instruments segment, 30% in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, and 5% in the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2018 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately 29 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) $65 million beginning in part in 2018 and, to a greater extent, in 2019 , including $20 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $10 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $5 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $30 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2017 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $90 million beginning in part in 2017 and to a greater extent in 2018 , including $50 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $20 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $10 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 4 ). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Life Sciences Solutions (Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 Change Revenues $ 6,269 $ 5,728 9 % Operating Income Margin 34.4 % 33.1 % 1.3 pt Sales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $541 million to $6.27 billion in 2018 . Sales increased $464 million ( 8% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, $49 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $28 million due to acquisitions. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand at each of the segment's primary businesses, with particular strength from sales of biosciences products and bioprocess production products. Operating income margin was 34.4% in 2018 compared to 33.1% in 2017 . The increase in operating margin resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by unfavorable sales mix, and strategic growth investments. Analytical Instruments (Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 Change Revenues $ 5,469 $ 4,821 13 % Operating Income Margin 22.8 % 21.3 % 1.5 pt Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $648 million to $5.47 billion in 2018 . Sales increased $562 million ( 12% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, $45 million due to acquisitions and $41 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand at each of the segment's primary businesses. Operating income margin was 22.8% in 2018 compared to 21.3% in 2017 . The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by strategic growth investments. Specialty Diagnostics (Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 Change Revenues $ 3,724 $ 3,486 7 % Operating Income Margin 25.6 % 26.6 % -1.0 pt Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $238 million to $3.72 billion in 2018 . Sales increased $189 million ( 5% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, $41 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $8 million due to an acquisition. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was due to broad based higher demand in each of the segment's primary businesses with particular strength in sales of products sold through the segment’s healthcare market channel. Operating income margin was 25.6% in 2018 and 26.6% in 2017 . The decrease resulted primarily from strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable sales mix, offset in part by profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, favorable foreign currency exchange. 31 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 Change Revenues $ 10,035 $ 7,825 28 % Operating Income Margin 12.5 % 12.8 % -0.3 pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $2.21 billion to $10.04 billion in 2018 . Sales increased $1.47 billion due to an acquisition, $694 million ( 9% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $50 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment's principal businesses with particular strength in its research and safety market channel business and its clinical trials business. Operating income margin was 12.5% in 2018 compared to 12.8% in 2017 . The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments, offset in part by profit on higher sales. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $521 million and $531 million in 2018 and 2017 , respectively (Note 5 ). An increase in interest expense of $75 million was offset in part by an increase in interest income of $56 million in 2018. In 2017 , other expense, net included $32 million of charges related to the amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments related to the acquisition of Patheon. Provision for Income Taxes The company recorded a provision for income taxes in 2018 including a net provision of $68 million to adjust the estimated initial effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 recorded in 2017, consisting of an incremental provision of $117 million offset in part by a $49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. These adjustments were required based on new U.S. Treasury guidance and further analysis of available tax accounting methods and elections, legislative updates, regulations, earnings and profit computations and foreign taxes. In 2018, the provision for income taxes also included a $71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the planned sale of the Anatomical Pathology business (Note 2). The company recorded a provision for income taxes in 2017 principally due to a net provision of $204 million from the effects of the Tax Act consisting primarily of a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, net of a benefit from adjusting the deferred tax balances for the U.S. statutory tax rate reduction. In 2017, the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes. In addition, in 2017 the company recorded a $65 million favorable adjustment to deferred tax balances due to extension of a tax holiday agreement in Singapore. The company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries in 2017. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $86 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $53 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017) for a net benefit of $33 million. The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $20 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The effective tax rate in both 2018 and 2017 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $591 million and $479 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2019 will be between 7% and 10% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. 32 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" in Note 1 . Contingent Liabilities The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the headings ""Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters,"" and ""Intellectual Property Matters"" in Note 11 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. 2017 Compared With 2016 (In millions) 2017 2016 Total Change Currency Translation Acquisitions Operations Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $ 5,728 $ 5,317 $ 411 $ 12 $ 99 $ 300 Analytical Instruments 4,821 3,668 1,153 29 794 330 Specialty Diagnostics 3,486 3,339 147 12 9 126 Laboratory Products and Services 7,825 6,724 1,101 13 727 361 Eliminations (942 ) (774 ) (168 ) 4 (4 ) (168 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 20,918 $ 18,274 $ 2,644 $ 70 $ 1,625 $ 949 Sales in 2017 were $20.92 billion, an increase of $2.64 billion from 2016. Sales increased $1.63 billion due to acquisitions. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $70 million in 2017. Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $949 million (5%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew. Sales growth was moderate in North America and Europe and particularly strong in Asia. In 2017, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.96 billion and 14.2%, respectively, compared with $2.46 billion and 13.5%, respectively, in 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies, the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by an increase in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, due to recent acquisitions, and strategic growth investments. In 2017, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $298 million, including $123 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, and, to a lesser extent, to conform the accounting policies of Patheon to the company's accounting policies. The company recorded $78 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs associated with recent acquisitions and changes in estimates of acquisition contingent consideration. In addition, the company recorded $97 million of cash restructuring costs, primarily to achieve acquisition synergies, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S and Europe. The company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company also recorded $27 million of net credits for litigation-related matters, which were mostly offset by compensation due at Patheon on the date of the acquisition, hurricane response/impairment costs, and net charges for the settlement/curtailment of retirement plans (see Note 15 ). 33 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) In 2016, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $395 million, including $102 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and to conform the accounting policies of FEI and Affymetrix to the company's accounting policies; $104 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions of FEI and Affymetrix. In addition, the company recorded $164 million of cash restructuring costs, primarily to achieve acquisition synergies, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. The company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company also recorded charges for litigation and environmental remediation matters. These costs were partially offset by gains on the sales of real estate. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2016 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2016 and to a greater extent in 2017, including $60 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $25 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $5 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $10 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Life Sciences Solutions (Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 Change Revenues $ 5,728 $ 5,317 8 % Operating Income Margin 33.1 % 30.1 % 3.0 pt Sales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $411 million to $5.73 billion in 2017. Sales increased $300 million (6%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, $99 million due to acquisitions and $12 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for biosciences products and, to a lesser extent, bioprocess production products as well as genetic sciences products. Operating income margin was 33.1% in 2017 compared to 30.1% in 2016. The increase in operating margin resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies and price increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments and acquisition dilution. Analytical Instruments (Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 Change Revenues $ 4,821 $ 3,668 31 % Operating Income Margin 21.3 % 20.4 % 0.9 pt Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $1.15 billion to $4.82 billion in 2017. Sales increased $794 million due to acquisitions, $330 million (9%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $29 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment's primary businesses particularly products sold by the segment's chromatography and mass spectrometry business and materials and structural analysis business. Operating income margin was 21.3% in 2017 compared to 20.4% in 2016. The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales in local currencies, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, the effect of acquisitions, offset in part by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and unfavorable sales mix. Specialty Diagnostics (Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 Change Revenues $ 3,486 $ 3,339 4 % Operating Income Margin 26.6 % 27.3 % -0.7 pt Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $147 million to $3.49 billion in 2017. Sales increased $126 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, $12 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $9 million due to acquisitions. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to higher demand for products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel as well as clinical diagnostics products and immunodiagnostics products. Operating income margin was 26.6% in 2017 and 27.3% in 2016. The decrease resulted primarily from strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable sales mix, offset in part by profit on higher sales in local currencies and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. 35 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 Change Revenues $ 7,825 $ 6,724 16 % Operating Income Margin 12.8 % 14.5 % -1.7 pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $1.10 billion to $7.83 billion in 2017. Sales increased $727 million due to acquisitions, $361 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $13 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products sold through the segment's channel business and, to a lesser extent, laboratory equipment and consumables. Operating income margin was 12.8% in 2017 compared to 14.5% in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix and strategic growth investments offset in part by profit on higher sales in local currencies and, to a lesser extent, the effect of acquisitions. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $531 million and $434 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively (Note 5 ). Interest expense increased $123 million, primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt. Provision for Income Taxes The company recorded a provision for income taxes in 2017 principally due to a net provision of $204 million from the effects of the Tax Act consisting primarily of a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, net of a benefit from adjusting the deferred tax balances for the U.S. statutory tax rate reduction. In 2017, the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes. In addition, in 2017 the company recorded a $65 million favorable adjustment to deferred tax balances due to extension of a tax holiday agreement in Singapore. The company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries in 2017. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $86 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $53 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017) for a net benefit of $33 million. The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $20 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016. In 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $91 million, offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits. The effective tax rate in both 2017 and 2016 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $479 million and $663 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $4.48 billion at December 31, 2018 , compared with $2.37 billion at December 31, 2017 , primarily due to higher cash and lower short-term debt. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $2.10 billion at December 31, 2018 and $1.34 billion at December 31, 2017 . 36 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) 2018 Cash provided by operating activities was $4.54 billion during 2018 . Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $366 million and $324 million , respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $591 million during 2018 , compared with $479 million in 2017 . The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $93 million during 2018 . Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $83 million during 2018 . During 2018 , the company’s investing activities used $1.25 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $536 million . The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $758 million of property, plant and equipment. On January 28, 2019, the company entered into an agreement to sell its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for approximately $1.14 billion . The sale is subject to customary closing conditions and applicable regulatory approvals. The company’s financing activities used $2.24 billion of cash during 2018 . Repayment of senior notes used cash of $2.05 billion . New long-term borrowings provided cash of $690 million . A net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $194 million . The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $500 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $266 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $136 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On July 7, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.50 billion of the company’s common stock. In 2018, the company repurchased $500 million of the company's common stock, depleting the 2016 authorization. On September 7, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock. In January 2019, the company repurchased $750 million of the company's common stock. At February 27, 2019 , authorization remained for $1.25 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. As of December 31, 2018 , the company’s short-term debt totaled $1.27 billion , including $693 million of commercial paper obligations and $573 million of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2018 , no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $82 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company expects to fund the acquisition of Gatan Inc. with a combination of existing cash balances and short-term borrowings. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $2.10 billion as of December 31, 2018 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2017 Cash provided by operating activities was $4.01 billion during 2017. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $1.02 billion primarily due to the Tax Act's one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries. Given the availability of foreign tax credits, the company does not expect the transition tax to result in significant cash requirements. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $274 million due to the timing of payments. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $362 million and $81 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies. An increase in other assets used cash of $153 million primarily due to the timing of income tax refunds. Cash payments for income taxes decreased to $479 million during 2017, compared with $663 million in 2016. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $200 million during 2017. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $93 million during 2017. 37 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2017, the company’s investing activities used $7.73 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $7.23 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $508 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities provided $3.85 billion of cash during 2017. Issuance of senior notes and borrowings under a term loan provided cash of $6.46 billion. The company also issued 10 million shares of its common stock for net proceeds of $1.69 billion. Repayment of senior notes and term loans used cash of $3.30 billion and a net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $134 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $750 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $237 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $128 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. 2016 Cash provided by operating activities was $3.26 billion during 2016. An increase in accounts receivable used cash of $352 million primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies and due to the mid-month timing of the acquisition of FEI when receivables are commonly lower than at quarter-end. Inventories provided cash of $98 million due to a reduction associated with fourth quarter 2016 sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $153 million primarily due to the timing of payments. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $216 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and incentive compensation. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $663 million during 2016, compared with $477 million in 2015. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $43 million during 2016. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $122 million during 2016. During 2016, the company’s investing activities used $5.52 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $5.18 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $444 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities provided $2.76 billion of cash during 2016. Issuance of senior notes and borrowings under term loans provided cash of $7.60 billion and an increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $904 million. Repayment of senior notes, the 364-day term loan and acquired debt used cash of $4.33 billion. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.25 billion of the company’s common stock and the payment of $238 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $87 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2016 , 2017 or 2018 , except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, residual value guarantees under three lease agreements, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table or discussed below. The amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees relate to guarantees of the company’s performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. 38 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018 . Payments due by Period or Expiration of Commitment (In millions) 2019 2020 and 2021 2022 and 2023 2024 and Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Debt principal, including short-term debt (a) $ 1,268 $ 4,727 $ 3,175 $ 10,004 $ 19,174 Interest 522 915 621 1,990 4,048 Capital lease obligations 3 6 3 — 12 Operating lease obligations 192 276 144 177 789 Unconditional purchase obligations (b) 673 46 21 5 745 Letters of credit and bank guarantees 183 19 13 3 218 Surety bonds and other guarantees 27 1 — — 28 Pension obligations on balance sheet 43 91 97 274 505 Asset retirement obligations accrued on balance sheet 6 15 11 13 45 Acquisition-related contingent consideration accrued on balance sheet 3 13 5 16 37 $ 2,920 $ 6,109 $ 4,090 $ 12,482 $ 25,601 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for debt and do not include any deferred issuance costs. (b) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. The contractual obligation at December 31, 2018 to acquire Gatan Inc. for approximately $925 million has been omitted from the above table. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.44 billion have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, other than those included in the above table, but expects that for 2019 , such expenditures will be between $800 and $850 million . Guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for three facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment (see Note 11 ). The residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of $147 million . The initial terms of these leases end in 2019, 2020 and 2023, although renewal options exist for each. A guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2018 was $38 million . In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. 39 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Norwegian kroner, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen and Swedish kronor. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2018 , the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2018 was $19.04 billion (see Note 13 ). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2018 would increase by approximately $1.06 billion . If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2018 would decrease by approximately $0.98 billion . In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. In 2018 , a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variable-rate debt would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $43 million . Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, euro, Canadian dollars, Swiss franc, Norwegian kroner and Danish kroner. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the ""accumulated other comprehensive items"" component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2018 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $0.84 billion . The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2018 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an additional unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $145 million . A 10% appreciation in year-end 2018 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $138 million . The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2018 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $25 million on the company’s net income. 40 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. F- 2 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 27, 2019 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

F- 8 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 . Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics, deliver medicines to market and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The company accounts for investments in businesses using the equity method when it has significant influence but not control (generally between 20% and 50% ownership) and is not the primary beneficiary. Presentation Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. Revenue Recognition Prior to 2018, the company recognized revenue after all significant obligations had been met, collectability was probable and title had passed, which typically occurred upon shipment, delivery, completion of services, or ratably over the contract period. Beginning in 2018, the company recognizes revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. See recent accounting pronouncements below for a discussion of the change in revenue recognition accounting that became effective in 2018. Consumables revenues consist of single-use products and are recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Instruments revenues typically consist of longer-lived assets that, for the substantial majority of sales, are recognized at a point in time in a manner similar to consumables. Service revenues (clinical trial logistics, pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services, asset management, diagnostic testing, training, service contracts, and field services including related time and materials) are recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of such services. For revenues recognized over time, the company generally uses costs accumulated as inputs to measure progress. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the consideration to which it expects to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognizes the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. The company exercises judgment in determining the timing of revenue by analyzing the point in time or the period over which the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the asset. The company immediately expenses contract costs that would otherwise be capitalized and amortized over a period of less than one year. Payments from customers for most instruments, consumables and services are typically due in a fixed number of days after shipment or delivery of the product. Service arrangements commonly call for payments in advance of performing the work (e.g. extended service contracts), upon completion of the service (e.g. pharmaceutical development and manufacturing) or a mix of both. See Note 3 for revenue disaggregated by type and by geographic region as well as further information about remaining performance obligations. Contract-related Balances Accounts receivable include amounts that have been billed and are currently due from customers. They are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers. F- 9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2018 2017 2016 Beginning Balance $ 109 $ 77 $ 70 Provision charged to expense 18 32 16 Accounts written off (12 ) (10 ) (9 ) Acquisitions, currency translation and other 2 10 — Ending Balance $ 117 $ 109 $ 77 Contract assets include revenues recognized in advance of billings and are recorded net of estimated losses resulting from the inability to invoice customers. Contract assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the amount of time expected to lapse until the company's right to consideration becomes unconditional. Current contract assets and noncurrent contract assets are included within other current assets and other assets, respectively, in the accompanying balance sheet. Contract liabilities include billings in excess of revenues recognized, such as those resulting from customer advances and deposits and unearned revenue on service contracts. Contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the periods over which remaining performance obligations are expected to be transferred to customers. Noncurrent contract liabilities are included within other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. Contract asset and liability balances are as follows: December 31, January 1, (In millions) 2018 2018 Current Contract Assets, Net $ 459 $ 329 Noncurrent Contract Assets, Net 15 18 Current Contract Liabilities 809 736 Noncurrent Contract Liabilities 355 322 Substantially all of the current contract liabilities balance at January 1, 2018 was recognized in revenue during 2018 . Warranty Obligations The company provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties, primarily from historical information, in cost of product revenues at the time product revenue is recognized. While the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies, the company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure and supplier warranties on parts delivered to the company. Should actual product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs or supplier warranties on parts differ from the company’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. The liability for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. Extended warranty agreements are considered service contracts, which are discussed above. Costs of service contracts are recognized as incurred. The changes in the carrying amount of standard product warranty obligations are as follows: Year Ended December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2018 2017 Beginning Balance $ 87 $ 78 Provision charged to income 121 110 Usage (109 ) (101 ) Adjustments to previously provided warranties, net (4 ) (4 ) Currency translation (3 ) 4 Ending Balance $ 92 $ 87 F- 10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Research and Development The company conducts research and development activities to increase its depth of capabilities in technologies, software and services. Research and development costs include employee compensation and benefits, consultants, facilities related costs, material costs, depreciation and travel. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Restructuring Costs Accounting for the timing and amount of termination benefits provided by the company to employees is determined based on whether: (a) the company has a substantive plan to provide such benefits, (b) the company has a written employment contract with the affected employees that includes a provision for such benefits, (c) the termination benefits are due to the occurrence of an event specified in an existing plan or agreement, or (d) the termination benefits are a one-time benefit. In certain circumstances, employee termination benefits may meet more than one of the characteristics listed above and therefore, may have individual elements that are subject to different accounting models. From time to time when executing a restructuring or exit plan, the company also incurs costs other than termination benefits, such as lease termination costs, that are not associated with or will not be incurred to generate revenues. These include costs that represent amounts under contractual obligations that exist prior to the restructuring plan communication date and will either continue after the restructuring plan is completed with no economic benefit or result in a penalty to cancel a contractual obligation. Such costs are recognized when incurred, which generally occurs at the contract termination or cease-use date but may continue over the remainder of the original contractual period. Income Taxes The company recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return. The financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the positions and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of money (Note 8 ). Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Except where the result would be antidilutive to income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share has been computed using the treasury stock method for outstanding stock options and restricted units (Note 9 ). Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consists principally of money market funds, commercial paper and other marketable securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined principally by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method with certain of the company’s businesses utilizing the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product or product line. In addition, the company has certain inventory that is subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company assesses the carrying value of this inventory based on a lower of cost or net realizable value analysis. The company records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the procurement of inventories, such as inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying statement of income. The components of inventories are as follows: December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2018 2017 Raw Materials $ 812 $ 708 Work in Process 430 505 Finished Goods 1,763 1,758 Inventories $ 3,005 $ 2,971 F- 11 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The value of inventories maintained using the LIFO method was $244 million and $219 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, which was below estimated replacement cost by $34 million and $31 million , respectively. Reductions to cost of revenues as a result of the liquidation of LIFO inventories were nominal during the three years ended December 31, 2018 . Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The company provides for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the property as follows: buildings and improvements, 25 to 40 years ; machinery and equipment (including software), 3 to 10 years ; and leasehold improvements, the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying statement of income. Property, plant and equipment consists of the following: December 31, December 31, (In millions) 2018 2017 Land $ 397 $ 401 Buildings and Improvements 1,729 1,662 Machinery, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements 4,694 4,276 Property, Plant and Equipment, at Cost 6,820 6,339 Less: Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization 2,655 2,292 Property, Plant and Equipment, Net $ 4,165 $ 4,047 Depreciation and amortization expense of property, plant and equipment was $526 million , $439 million and $380 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Acquisition-related Intangible Assets Acquisition-related intangible assets include the costs of acquired customer relationships, product technology, tradenames and other specifically identifiable intangible assets, and are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 20 years . In addition, the company has tradenames and in-process research and development that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. The company reviews intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate they may be impaired. Acquisition-related intangible assets are as follows: F- 12 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Other Assets Other assets in the accompanying balance sheet include deferred tax assets, cash surrender value of life insurance, insurance recovery receivables related to product liability matters, pension assets, investments, notes receivable, restricted cash and other assets. Prior to January 1, 2018, investments for which there are not readily determinable market values were accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The company periodically evaluated the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, which provided that they are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Effective January 1, 2018, equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The company performs qualitative assessments to identify impairments of these investments. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the company had such investments with carrying amounts of $36 million and $32 million , respectively, which are included in other assets. Goodwill The company assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such events or circumstances generally include the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with one or more of the company’s reporting units. The company is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the goodwill impairment test is necessary. If the qualitative assessment results in a determination that the fair value of a F- 13 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) reporting unit is more-likely-than-not less than its carrying amount, the company performs the goodwill impairment test. The company may bypass the qualitative assessment for the reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the goodwill impairment test. The company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer market multiples. The company would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value. The company determined that no impairments existed in 2018 , 2017 or 2016 . The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as follows: (In millions) Life Sciences Solutions Analytical Instruments Specialty Diagnostics Laboratory Products and Services Total Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 8,246 $ 4,686 $ 3,659 $ 4,737 $ 21,328 Acquisitions 136 99 27 3,256 3,518 Finalization of purchase price allocations for 2016 acquisitions (4 ) 68 — (1 ) 63 Currency translation 14 174 171 25 384 Other (1 ) — (1 ) (1 ) (3 ) Balance at December 31, 2017 8,391 5,027 3,856 8,016 25,290 Acquisitions 161 — — — 161 Finalization of purchase price allocations for 2017 acquisitions — 1 — 20 21 Currency translation (5 ) (77 ) (121 ) 79 (124 ) Other 1 (1 ) — (1 ) (1 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 8,548 $ 4,950 $ 3,735 $ 8,114 $ 25,347 Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at fair value and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition. Currency Translation All assets and liabilities of the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the ""accumulated other comprehensive items"" component of shareholders’ equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year. Currency transaction (losses) gains are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were $19 million , $(31) million and $19 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Derivative Contracts The company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings. The company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Norwegian kroner, Canadian F- 14 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) dollars, Japanese yen and Swedish kronor. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. Cash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Fair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings. During 2016, in connection with new debt issuances, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements. The company includes the gain or loss on the hedged items (fixed-rate debt) in the same line item (interest expense) as the offsetting effective portion of the loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps. Net investment hedges. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The majority of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In addition, significant estimates were made in estimating future cash flows to assess potential impairment of assets and in determining the fair value of acquired intangible assets (Note 2 ) and the ultimate loss from abandoning leases at facilities being exited (Note 15 ). Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to align the accounting for implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the accounting for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license. Under the new guidance, certain implementation costs that previously were required to be expensed will be capitalized and amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement. The company adopted the guidance in the fourth quarter of 2018, prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The company expects to adopt the guidance when it is effective in 2020 using a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The company expects to adopt the guidance when it is effective in 2020 with some items requiring a prospective method and others requiring a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In February 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to allow reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive items (AOCI) to retained earnings for certain tax effects on items within AOCI resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). The company adopted this guidance in January 2018 and recorded the reclassifications in the period of adoption. The balance sheet impact of adopting this guidance is included in the table below. This guidance only relates to the effects of the Tax Act. For all other tax law changes that have occurred or may occur in the future, the company reclassifies the tax effects to the consolidated statement of income on an item-by-item basis when the pre-tax item in AOCI is reclassified to income. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued guidance to address the application of accounting guidance in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017. The company reported provisional amounts in its 2017 financial statements for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act for which a F- 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) reasonable estimate could be determined. Adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period, which ended December 22, 2018, are included as adjustments to Provision for Income Taxes in 2018 (Note 8 ). In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance. Among other things, the new guidance will permit more hedging strategies to qualify for hedge accounting, allow for additional time to perform an initial assessment of a hedge’s effectiveness, and permit a qualitative effectiveness test for certain hedges after initial qualification. The company adopted this guidance in January 2018. The balance sheet impact of adopting this guidance is included in the table below. In March 2017, the FASB issued new guidance intended to improve the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The new guidance requires the service cost component of net periodic cost be reported in the same line item(s) as other employee compensation costs and all other components of the net periodic cost be reported in the income statement below operating income. The company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2018 and applied the changes to the statement of income retrospectively. As a result of adoption of this guidance, the accompanying 2017 and 2016 statements of income reflect the following changes from previously reported amounts: (In millions) 2017 2016 Increase (Decrease) in Total Costs and Operating Expenses (principally Selling, General and Administrative Expenses) $ 8 $ (9 ) (Decrease) Increase in Operating Income (8 ) 9 Increase (Decrease) in Other Income (Expense) 8 (9 ) In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying the definition of a business and providing criteria to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not defined as a business. The new guidance requires such integrated sets to be defined as an asset (and not a business) if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. The adoption of this guidance as of January 1, 2018 did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance eliminating the deferral of the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers. The impact of this guidance in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future asset transfers which usually occur in connection with planning around acquisitions and other business structuring activities. The balance sheet impact of adopting this guidance as of January 1, 2018 is included in the table below. In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to require a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis, such as accounts receivable, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. During 2018, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company expects to adopt the guidance when it is effective in 2020 using a modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities, initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments, with corresponding right-of-use assets. The new guidance also sets forth new disclosure requirements related to leases. During 2017 and 2018, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The guidance is effective for the company in 2019. The company has elected to adopt the guidance using a modified retrospective method, by applying the transition approach as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Comparative periods will not be restated. The company has substantially completed its analysis of the new guidance by considering which practical expedients and policies to elect, deploying a software tool to assist in the accounting calculations, surveying functional groups that oversee vendor relationships, and developing processes and controls to manage the new lease accounting guidance and gather information for the required disclosures. The company expects the impact to the balance sheet of recording right-of-use assets and lease liabilities will be less than 2% of total assets and less than 3% of total liabilities. The company also expects that the impact of adoption of the guidance to its results of operations and cash flows will be nominal. The company’s future commitments under lease obligations are summarized in Note 11. In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. This guidance requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with subsequent changes recognized in net income, except for those accounted for under the equity method or requiring consolidation. The guidance also changes the accounting for investments without a F- 16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) readily determinable fair value and that do not qualify for the practical expedient permitted by the guidance to estimate fair value. The balance sheet impact of adopting this guidance as of January 1, 2018 is included in the table below. In May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most previous revenue recognition guidance. The new standard also requires significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity's nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. During 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification, including the elimination of certain SEC Staff Guidance. The guidance is effective for the company in 2018. The company elected to adopt this guidance through application of the modified retrospective method by applying it to contracts that were not completed as of December 31, 2017 (in addition to new contracts in 2018). Adoption of new guidance that became effective on January 1, 2018, impacted the company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: (In millions) December 31, 2017 as Reported Impact of Adopting New Revenue Guidance Impact of Adopting New Equity Investment Guidance Impact of Adopting New Intra-entity Tax Guidance Impact of Adopting New Hedge Accounting Guidance Impact of Adopting New Tax Effects on Items in AOCI Guidance January 1, 2018 as Adopted Accounts Receivable, Less Allowances $ 3,879 $ (8 ) $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 3,871 Inventories 2,971 (252 ) — — — — 2,719 Other Current Assets 1,236 229 — — — — 1,465 Other Assets 1,227 18 — (77 ) — — 1,168 Deferred Revenue 719 (719 ) — — — — — Contract Liabilities — 736 — — — — 736 Other Accrued Expenses 1,848 (153 ) — — — — 1,695 Deferred Income Taxes 2,766 — — (57 ) — 2 2,711 Other Long-term Liabilities 2,569 74 — — — — 2,643 Long-term Obligations 18,873 — — — (3 ) — 18,870 Retained Earnings 15,914 49 (1 ) (20 ) 3 87 16,032 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items (2,003 ) — 1 — — (89 ) (2,091 ) Had the company continued to use the revenue recognition guidance in effect prior to 2018, no material changes would have resulted to the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 , from am ounts reported therein. However, inventories would have b een $357 million higher and other current assets would have been $359 million lower as of December 31, 2018 , primarily as a result of differences in the accounting for pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services under the new revenue guidance. Under the prior guidance, costs of these services were recorded in inventory and revenues were recognized generally when the products were delivered to customers. Under the new guidance, costs are expensed and revenues are recognized as the manufacturing service is performed and the company's rights to consideration are recorded as contract assets and included in other current assets. Note 2 . Acquisitions and Dispositions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products. F- 17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. 2018 The company has entered into an agreement to acquire Gatan, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Roper Technologies, Inc., for approximately $925 million in cash. Gatan is a leading manufacturer of instrumentation and software used to enhance and extend the operation and performance of electron microscopes. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. On October 25, 2018, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Becton Dickinson and Company's Advanced Bioprocessing business for $477 million in cash. This North America-based business adds complementary cell culture products that expand the segment's bioproduction offerings to help customers increase yield during production of biologic drugs. Revenues of the Advanced Bioprocessing business were $100 million in 2017. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $146 million was allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible. In 2018, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, IntegenX Inc., a North America-based provider of a rapid DNA platform for use in forensics and law enforcement applications, for an aggregate purchase price of $65 million .

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) $35.00 per share in cash, or $7.36 billion , including the assumption of net debt. The company financed the purchase price, including the repayment of indebtedness of Patheon, with issuances of debt and equity. Patheon provides comprehensive, integrated and highly customizable solutions as well as the expertise to help biopharmaceutical companies of all sizes satisfy complex development and manufacturing needs. The acquisition provided entry into the pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization market and added a complementary service to the company's existing pharmaceutical services portfolio. Patheon's revenues totaled $1.87 billion for the year ended October 31, 2016. The purchase price exceeded the fair market value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $3.28 billion was allocated to goodwill, $125 million of which is tax deductible. On March 2, 2017, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, Core Informatics, a North America-based provider of cloud-based platforms supporting scientific data management, for a total purchase price of $94 million , net of cash acquired.

This deferred tax liability was reversed in 2017 as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act. F- 20 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Unaudited Pro Forma Information The following unaudited pro forma information provides the effect of the company's 2017 acquisition of Patheon as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2016, and the effects of the company's 2016 acquisitions of FEI and Affymetrix as if the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2015: (In millions) 2017 2016 Revenues $ 22,144 $ 20,807 Net Income $ 2,258 $ 1,791 The historical consolidated financial information of the company, Patheon, FEI, and Affymetrix has been adjusted in the pro forma information to give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the acquisitions and related financing arrangements, are expected to have a continuing impact on the company, and are factually supportable. To reflect the acquisition of Patheon as if it had occurred on January 1, 2016, and the acquisitions of FEI and Affymetrix as if they had occurred on January 1, 2015, the unaudited pro forma results include adjustments to reflect, among other things, the incremental intangible asset amortization to be incurred based on the preliminary values of each identifiable intangible asset and the interest expense from debt financings obtained to partially fund the cash consideration transferred. Pro forma adjustments were tax effected at the company's historical statutory rates in effect for the respective periods. The unaudited pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the combined results of operations that would have been realized had the acquisitions and related financings occurred on the aforementioned dates, nor are they meant to be indicative of any anticipated combined results of operations that the company will experience after the transaction. In addition, the amounts do not include any adjustments for actions that may be taken following the completion of the transaction, such as expected cost savings, operating synergies, or revenue enhancements that may be realized subsequent to the transaction. Pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2017, excludes certain items associated with the Patheon acquisition that were included in the determination of net income for that period. These items have been included in the determination of pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2016, and are as follows: $54 million of direct transaction costs, $39 million of accounting policy conformity adjustments, $21 million of initial restructuring costs, $40 million reduction of revenues for revaluing the deferred revenue obligations to fair value, and $55 million of expense related to the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventories. Pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2016, excludes certain items associated with the FEI and Affymetrix acquisitions that were included in the determination of net income for that period. These items have been included in the determination of pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 (not presented), and are as follows: $102 million of direct transaction costs, $33 million of accounting policy conformity adjustments, $46 million of initial restructuring costs, $6 million reduction of revenues for revaluing the deferred revenue obligations to fair value, and $99 million of expense related to the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventories. The company’s results would not have been materially different from its pro forma results had the company’s other 2018, 2017 or 2016 acquisitions occurred at the beginning of 2017, 2016 or 2015, respectively. Disposition On January 28, 2019, the company entered into an agreement to sell its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for approximately $1.14 billion . The business is part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. Revenues in 2018 of the business to be sold were approximately $344 million . The sale is subject to customary closing conditions and applicable regulatory approvals.

The investment gains include an $8 million gain on the sale of a joint venture for net proceeds of $65 million . Note 6 . Stock-based Compensation Expense The company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others. These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, stock options or performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the company’s Board of Directors or, for certain non-officer grants, by the company’s employee equity committee, which consists of its chief executive officer. The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises and restricted unit vestings. Grants of stock options and restricted units generally provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option or unit holder’s employment, all options and service-based restricted unit awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment). Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier. The components of stock-based compensation expense are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses and are as follows: (In millions) 2018 2017 2016 Stock Option Awards $ 57 $ 53 $ 41 Restricted Unit Awards 124 106 92 Total Stock-based Compensation Expense $ 181 $ 159 $ 133 Stock Options The company’s practice is to grant stock options at fair market value. Options vest over 3 - 5 years with terms of 7 - 10 years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions. Vesting of the option awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions. The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing the company’s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures. F- 25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Expected Stock Price Volatility 20 % 20 % 21 % Risk Free Interest Rate 2.6 % 1.9 % 1.2 % Expected Life of Options (years) 4.3 4.3 4.3 Expected Annual Dividend 0.3 % 0.4 % 0.5 % The weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were $43.45 , $30.73 and $24.54 , respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $312 million , $199 million and $176 million , respectively. The intrinsic value is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the option. A summary of the company’s option activity for the year ended December 31, 2018 is presented below: Shares (in millions) Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (a) (in millions) Outstanding at December 31, 2017 9.0 $ 121.78 Granted 1.6 211.38 Exercised (2.3 ) 86.88 Canceled/Expired (0.3 ) 164.58 Outstanding at December 31, 2018 8.0 $ 148.09 4.2 Vested and Unvested Expected to Vest at December 31, 2018 7.7 $ 146.24 4.2 $ 595 Exercisable at December 31, 2018 3.5 $ 114.93 2.8 $ 382 (a) Market price per share on December 31, 2018 was $223.79 . The intrinsic value is zero for options with exercise prices above the market price. As of December 31, 2018 , there was $101 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2022 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.4 years . Restricted Share/Unit Awards Awards of restricted units convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The awards generally vest over 3 - 4 years , assuming continued employment, with some exceptions. Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions. The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period. Recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to accrue dividend equivalents. The fair value of service- and performance-based restricted unit awards is determined based on the number of units granted and the market value of the company’s shares on the grant date. For awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the award. F- 26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A summary of the company’s restricted unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2018 is presented below: Units (in millions) Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2017 1.4 $ 150.23 Granted 0.6 204.72 Vested (0.7 ) 150.28 Forfeited (0.1 ) 166.95 Unvested at December 31, 2018 1.2 $ 177.04 The total fair value of shares vested during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $114 million , $97 million and $91 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 , there was $144 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock unit awards. The cost is expected to be recognized through 2022 with a weighted average amortization period of 1.9 years . Employee Stock Purchase Plans Qualifying employees are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan sponsored by the company. Shares may be purchased under the program at 95% of the fair market value at the end of the purchase period and the shares purchased are not subject to a holding period. Shares are purchased through payroll deductions of up to 10% of each participating employee’s qualifying gross wages. The company issued 0.1 million , 0.1 million and 0.2 million shares, respectively, of its common stock in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 under the employee stock purchase plan. Note 7 . Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 401(k) Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans The company’s 401(k) savings and other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company’s eligible U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees. Contributions to the plans are made by both the employee and the company. Company contributions are based on the level of employee contributions. Company contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company. In 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the company charged to expense $204 million , $161 million and $140 million , respectively, related to its defined contribution plans. Defined Benefit Pension Plans Employees of a number of the company’s non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries. Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws. The company also maintains postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses where certain employees are eligible to participate. The costs of the postretirement healthcare programs are generally funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis. The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive items, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive items is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost. When a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits. The company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined. During 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the company made cash contributions of approximately $93 million , $200 million and $43 million , respectively. Additionally, in 2016, the company contributed insurance contracts valued at $16 million to two of its German F- 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) defined benefit plans. Contributions to the plans included in the following table are estimated at between $35 and $65 million for 2019 .

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The actuarial assumptions used to compute the funded status for the plans are based upon information available as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and are as follows: Domestic Pension Benefits Non-U.S. Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Weighted Average Assumptions Used to Determine Projected Benefit Obligations Discount rate 4.21 % 3.55 % 2.34 % 2.10 % 3.81 % 3.43 % Average rate of increase in employee compensation N/A N/A 2.47 % 2.59 % N/A N/A Initial healthcare cost trend rate 6.35 % 6.73 % Ultimate healthcare cost trend rate 4.89 % 5.04 % The actuarial assumptions used to compute the net periodic pension benefit cost (income) are based upon information available as of the beginning of the year, as presented in the following table: Domestic Pension Benefits Non-U.S. Pension Benefits 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 Weighted Average Assumptions Used to Determine Net Benefit Cost (Income) Discount rate 3.54 % 4.06 % 4.25 % 2.10 % 1.95 % 2.83 % Average rate of increase in employee compensation N/A N/A N/A 2.59 % 3.10 % 3.06 % Expected long-term rate of return on assets 5.75 % 6.50 % 7.00 % 3.31 % 3.11 % 3.74 % The ultimate healthcare cost trend rates for the postretirement benefit plans are expected to be reached between 2019 and 2040 . The discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations. The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan. The company utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot-rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance. In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks. Asset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements. The expected rate of compensation increase reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on historic salary increase experience and management’s expectations of future salary increases. The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive items expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost in 2019 are not material. F- 29 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining the company’s benefit obligation at December 31, 2018 . Benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels, average years employed and average life spans, among other factors, and changes in any of these factors could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments. Estimated future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows: (In millions) Domestic Pension Benefits Non-U.S. Pension Benefits Post- retirement Benefits Expected Benefit Payments 2019 $ 92 $ 34 $ 3 2020 85 36 3 2021 86 37 3 2022 84 39 3 2023 83 42 3 2024-2028 393 244 12 F- 30 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point effective January 2018 would not have caused a material change in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 and the 2018 aggregate of service and interest costs. Domestic Pension Plan Assets The company’s overall objective is to manage the assets in a liability framework where investments are selected that are expected to have similar changes in fair value as the related liabilities will have upon changes in interest rates. The company invests in a portfolio of both return-seeking and liability-hedging assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth and to insulate the funded position from interest rate volatility. The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities. The company also has a small portfolio (comprising less than 1% of invested assets) of private equity investments. The target allocations for the remaining investments are approximately 10% to funds investing in U.S. equities, approximately 10% to funds investing in international equities and approximately 80% to funds investing in fixed income securities. The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments. Non-U.S. Pension Plan Assets The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S. The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans. Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies. When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers. The investments may include hedge funds, multi-asset funds, alternative investments and derivative funds with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 0% - 25% for equities, 0% - 55% for fixed income, 0% - 20% for hedge funds, 0% - 100% for multi-asset funds, 0% to 15% for alternative investments and 0% - 22% for funds holding derivatives. The derivatives held by the funds are primarily interest rate swaps intended to match the movements in the plan liabilities as well as equity futures in a synthetic equity fund which provide targeted exposure to equity markets without the fund holding individual equity positions. Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.

U.S. Tax Reform Impacts On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted. The Tax Act includes significant changes to existing U.S. tax laws that affect the company, including a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and creation of a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and F- 33 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) profits of foreign subsidiaries (transition tax). As detailed below, the company recognized a net charge of $204 million for certain aspects of the Tax Act in its 2017 financial statements for which the accounting was provisional, but a reasonable estimate could be determined. During 2018, the company completed its accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recognized net adjustments (detailed below) to the provisional amounts, totaling a net charge of $68 million , as a component of income tax expense. The transition tax is based on the company's total post-1986 earnings and profits, the tax on which was previously deferred from U.S. income taxes under U.S. law. The company recorded a provisional amount for the transition tax liability for each of the foreign subsidiaries, resulting in a total transition liability of $1.25 billion at December 31, 2017. After further analysis of new U.S. Treasury guidance, available tax accounting methods and elections, legislative updates, regulations, earnings and profits computations and foreign taxes, the company finalized the calculations of the transition tax liability during 2018. The increase in the liability for the transition tax in 2018 consisted of an incremental provision of $117 million offset in part by a $49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. In 2017, as a result of the Tax Act, the company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future (which was generally 21% ), by recording a provisional tax benefit of $1.06 billion . During 2018, no material changes to this provisional amount were made. The Tax Act included a provision for global intangible low-taxed income. The company has adopted a policy to account for this provision as a period cost. Other Tax Impacts In 2018, the provision for income taxes also included a $71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the planned sale of the Anatomical Pathology business (Note 2). The foreign tax credits discussed below are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. In 2017, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $86 million , offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $53 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017). The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $20 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In 2017 the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes. In 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $91 million , offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016). The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company generally receives a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees, or the vesting of restricted stock units held by employees, for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise. The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization of tax attributes. Prior to 2017, the amount of the tax deduction in excess of compensation cost recognized was allocated to capital in excess of par value. Beginning in 2017, these excess tax benefits reduce the tax provision. In 2018 and 2017 , the company's tax provision was reduced by $77 million and $65 million , respectively, of such benefits. In 2016 , $53 million of such benefits were allocated to capital in excess of par value. The company has significant activities in Singapore and has received considerable tax incentives. The local taxing authority granted the company pioneer company status which provides an incentive encouraging companies to undertake activities that have the effect of promoting economic or technological development in Singapore. This incentive equates to a tax exemption on earnings associated with most of the company’s manufacturing activities in Singapore and continues through December 31, 2026 . In 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the impact of this tax holiday decreased the annual effective tax rates by 0.9 percentage points, 1.0 percentage points and 1.1 percentage points, respectively, and increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.07 , $0.06 and $0.06 , respectively. In connection with the March 2017 extension of this agreement until 2026, F- 34 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) the company recorded a benefit in the first quarter of 2017 of approximately $65 million ( $0.16 per diluted share) for the effect on deferred tax balances of the extended tax holiday. Net deferred tax asset (liability) in the accompanying balance sheet consists of the following: (In millions) 2018 2017 Deferred Tax Asset (Liability) Depreciation and amortization $ (3,444 ) $ (3,957 ) Net operating loss and credit carryforwards 1,311 1,150 Reserves and accruals 148 139 Accrued compensation 250 265 Inventory basis difference 105 81 Other capitalized costs 103 61 Unrealized losses on hedging instruments 23 125 Other, net 143 126 Deferred tax assets (liabilities), net before valuation allowance (1,361 ) (2,010 ) Less: Valuation allowance 471 256 Deferred tax assets (liabilities), net $ (1,832 ) $ (2,266 ) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not expire unutilized. At December 31, 2018 , all of the company’s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets, primarily net operating losses, for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense. The changes in the valuation allowance are as follows: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2018 2017 2016 Beginning Balance $ 256 $ 113 $ 109 Additions charged to income tax provision 223 28 — Additions due to acquisitions 17 108 25 Deductions (15 ) — — Currency translation and other (10 ) 7 (21 ) Ending Balance $ 471 $ 256 $ 113 At December 31, 2018 , the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $412 million , $1.69 billion and $4.41 billion , respectively. Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2019 through 2038 . Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $2.15 billion expire in the years 2019 through 2038 , and the remainder do not expire. The company operates in various jurisdictions around the world. A provision has not been made for certain U.S. state income taxes or additional non-U.S. taxes on $14.4 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that could be subject to taxation if remitted to the U.S. because such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely. It is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized tax liability due to i) the extent of uncertainty as to which remittance structure would be used (among several possibilities) should a decision be made to repatriate; and ii) the implications of indirect taxes, including withholding taxes that could potentially be required depending on the repatriation structure. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax costs. Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of December 31, 2018 , the company had $1.44 billion of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate. F- 35 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: (In millions) 2018 2017 2016 Balance at beginning of year $ 1,409 $ 802 $ 350 Additions due to acquisitions — 31 54 Reductions due to acquisitions (5 ) — — Additions for tax positions of current year 48 565 342 Additions for tax positions of prior years 82 51 94 Closure of tax years (5 ) — (28 ) Settlements (87 ) (40 ) (10 ) Balance at end of year $ 1,442 $ 1,409 $ 802 During 2018, the company's unrecognized tax benefits increased $85 million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and $45 million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions. All of the total $1.44 billion liability is classified as a long-term liability. The company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months. During 2017, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits provisionally increased $511 million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to the scope of the Tax Act’s one-time transition tax, $54 million relating to foreign tax positions, $43 million as a result of a foreign exchange loss recognized on the refinancing of certain long term inter-company debt and $31 million due to an acquisition. During 2016, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits increased $342 million due to the uncertainty around the deductibility of a foreign exchange loss on intercompany investments, $54 million due to acquisitions, $43 million due to tax planning related to prior years that resulted in amended tax filings, $35 million relating to foreign tax positions and $14 million due to the utilization of deferred tax assets. In 2016, the company also settled the Life Technologies tax audit for the 2012 to 2014 tax years which reduced the reserve on unrecognized tax benefits by $10 million . The company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $59 million and $31 million , respectively. The company conducts business globally and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S., income tax examinations for years before 2011. F- 36 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) As of December 31, 2018 , the annual repayment requirements for debt obligations are as follows: (In millions) 2019 $ 1,271 2020 2,229 2021 2,504 2022 1,377 2023 1,801 2024 and Thereafter 10,004 $ 19,186 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , short-term obligations and current maturities of long-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet included $693 million and $960 million , respectively, of commercial paper, short-term bank borrowings and borrowings under lines of credit of certain of the company’s subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate for short-term borrowings was 0.74% and slightly below 0% at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. In addition to available borrowings under the company’s revolving credit agreements, discussed below, the company had unused lines of credit of $68 million as of December 31, 2018 . These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates. Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides for up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The facility expires in July 2021 . The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in Euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2018 , no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $82 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of December 31, 2018 , outstanding borrowings under these programs were $693 million , with a weighted average remaining period to maturity of 51 days and are classified as short-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet. Senior Notes Interest on the floating rate senior notes is payable quarterly. Interest is payable annually on the other euro-denominated senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. In 2018, Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 included in the table above. This subsidiary has no independent function other than financing F- 39 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) activities. The Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company and no other subsidiaries of the company have guaranteed the obligations. Prior to issuing the 3.00% Senior Notes due 2023, the company had entered into an agreement to hedge its exposure related to the interest rate on the anticipated borrowings (described under the heading ""Cash Flow Hedge Arrangements"" in Note 13 ) that was terminated in April 2016. The company had a cash outlay of $75 million in 2016 associated with termination of the arrangement, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. Interest Rate Swap Arrangements In 2016, the company terminated certain of its fixed to floating rate swap arrangements. The terminated swaps were accounted for as fair value hedges. As a result of terminating these arrangements, the company received $61 million (excluding accrued interest) in cash in 2016, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. The proceeds were recorded as part of the carrying value of the underlying debt and will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining terms of the respective debt instruments. Subsequently, the company entered into new swap arrangements which are included in the table below. The company has entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks on several of its outstanding senior notes. The aggregate amounts of the swaps are equal to the principal amounts of the notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the interest payment dates of the notes. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate and receive a fixed rate. The variable interest rates reset monthly. The swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges of the notes. See Note 13 for additional information on the interest rate swap arrangements and related cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements. The following table summarizes the outstanding interest rate swap arrangements on the company's senior notes at December 31, 2018 : Aggregate Notional Amount Pay Rate as of (Dollars in millions) Pay Rate December 31, 2018 Receive Rate 4.50% Senior Notes due 2021 (a) 1,000 1-month LIBOR + 3.4420% 5.7913 % 4.50 % 3.60% Senior Notes due 2021 1,100 1-month LIBOR + 2.5150% 4.9701 % 3.60 % 3.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (a) 1,000 1-month LIBOR + 1.7640% 4.2191 % 3.00 % (a) The payments on $1.5 billion notional value of these interest rate swaps are offset in part by cross-currency interest rate swaps which effectively reduced the pay rate as of December 31, 2018 from a weighted average of 5.00% to a weighted average of 1.96% . In 2018, the company entered into $1.5 billion notional value of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which effectively convert a portion of the semi-annual payments related to the variable rate, U.S. dollar denominated, LIBOR-based interest rate swaps to payments on variable rate, euro denominated, EURIBOR-based cross-currency interest rate swaps. Note 11 . Commitments and Contingencies Operating Leases The company leases certain logistics, office, and manufacturing facilities. Income from continuing operations includes expense from operating leases of $211 million , $198 million and $182 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The following is a summary of annual future minimum lease and rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2018 : (In millions) 2019 $ 192 2020 158 2021 118 2022 86 2023 58 2024 and Thereafter 177 $ 789 F- 40 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Purchase Obligations The company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. The aggregate amount of the company’s unconditional purchase obligations totaled $745 million at December 31, 2018 and the majority of these obligations are expected to be settled during 2019 . Letters of Credit, Guarantees and Other Commitments Outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $218 million at December 31, 2018 . Substantially all of these letters of credit and guarantees expire before 2025. Outstanding surety bonds and other guarantees totaled $28 million at December 31, 2018 . The expiration of these bonds and guarantees ranges through 2020. The letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds principally secure performance obligations, and allow the holder to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit, bank guarantee or surety bond if the applicable business unit does not perform as contractually required. The company is a guarantor of pension plan obligations of a divested business. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2018 was $38 million . In connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with respect to those assumed liabilities. In the event a third-party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be liable to the third-party for such obligations. However, in such event, the company would be entitled to seek indemnification from the buyer. The company has guaranteed the residual value of three leased operating facilities with initial lease terms ending in 2019, 2020 and 2023. The company has agreed with the lessor to comply with certain financial covenants consistent with its other debt arrangements (Note 10 ). The aggregate maximum guarantee under these three lease arrangements is $147 million . Indemnifications In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities). The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction. Where probable, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications. In connection with the company’s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties. When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility. As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement. The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company’s financial position or results of operations. In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement. The company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions. Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment F- 41 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. At December 31, 2018 , the company’s total environmental liability was approximately $69 million . While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company including matters involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters. A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred. The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed below , nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company’s continuing operations at December 31, 2018 , was approximately $215 million to $349 million on an undiscounted basis. The portion of these liabilities assumed in the 2006 merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present) value at the date of merger. The company’s accrual for all such matters in total, including the discounted liabilities, was $204 million at December 31, 2018 (or $221 million undiscounted). The accrual includes estimated defense costs and is gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $86 million at December 31, 2018 (or $97 million undiscounted) that are included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. The portion of these insurance assets assumed in the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at the date of merger. In addition to the above accrual, as of December 31, 2018 , the company had a product liability accrual of $10 million (undiscounted) relating to divested businesses. The assets and liabilities assumed at the Fisher merger date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted average discount rate of 4.67% ). The discount on the liabilities of approximately $17 million and the discount on the assets of approximately $11 million (net discount $6 million ) are being accreted to interest expense over the expected settlement period. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. F- 42 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Intellectual Property Matters On June 3, 2013, Unisone Strategic IP filed a complaint against Life Technologies in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California alleging patent infringement by Life Technologies’ supply chain management system software, which operates with product ""supply centers"" installed at customer sites. Plaintiff seeks damages for alleged willful infringement, attorneys’ fees, costs, and injunctive relief. On August 24, 2017, Unisone filed an appeal from a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board that found the challenged patent claims invalid. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s ruling finding the challenged claims in the Unisone patent invalid. Unisone has until March 11, 2019 to file an appeal with the United States Supreme Court. Note 12 . Comprehensive Income and Shareholders' Equity Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) combines net income and other comprehensive items. Other comprehensive items represent certain amounts that are reported as components of shareholders’ equity in the accompanying balance sheet. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recorded an out of period adjustment to correct an error in the accounting for income taxes associated with the partial hedge of its net investment in a foreign operation in 2014 through the third quarter of 2017. The adjustment affected deferred income taxes and other comprehensive income and, in the aggregate, increased comprehensive income by $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The adjustment does not have any impact on the company’s statements of income or cash flows. The company determined that the adjustment was not material to the consolidated financial statements for any previously reported annual or interim periods. Changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net of tax are as follows: (In millions) Currency Translation Adjustment Unrealized Losses on Available-for- Sale Investments Unrealized Losses on Hedging Instruments Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Liability Adjustment Total Balance at December 31, 2017 (1,755 ) (1 ) (50 ) (197 ) (2,003 ) Cumulative effect of accounting changes (Note 1) (54 ) 1 (11 ) (24 ) (88 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (434 ) — — 3 (431 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive items — — 9 15 24 Net other comprehensive items (434 ) — 9 18 (407 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 (2,243 ) — (52 ) (203 ) (2,498 ) Shareholders’ Equity At December 31, 2018 , the company had reserved 30 million unissued shares of its common stock for possible issuance under stock-based compensation plans. Note 13 . Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements The company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during 2018 . The company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of insurance contracts, investments in money market funds, derivative contracts, mutual funds holding publicly traded securities and other F- 43 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) investments in unit trusts held as assets to satisfy outstanding deferred compensation and retirement liabilities; and acquisition-related contingent consideration. The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access. Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data. The following tables present information about the company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 : December 31, Quoted Prices in Active Markets Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs (In millions) 2018 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets Cash equivalents $ 769 $ 769 $ — $ — Bank time deposits 2 2 — — Investments in mutual funds and other similar instruments 10 10 — — Warrants 8 — 8 — Insurance contracts 113 — 113 — Derivative contracts 31 — 31 — Total Assets $ 933 $ 781 $ 152 $ — Liabilities Derivative contracts $ 145 $ — $ 145 $ — Contingent consideration 37 — — 37 Total Liabilities $ 182 $ — $ 145 $ 37 December 31, Quoted Prices in Active Markets Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs (In millions) 2017 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets Cash equivalents $ 22 $ 22 $ — $ — Bank time deposits 2 2 — — Investments in mutual funds and other similar instruments 13 13 — — Warrants 2 — 2 — Insurance contracts 116 — 116 — Derivative contracts 10 — 10 — Total Assets $ 165 $ 37 $ 128 $ — Liabilities Derivative contracts $ 139 $ — $ 139 $ — Contingent consideration 35 — — 35 Total Liabilities $ 174 $ — $ 139 $ 35 F- 44 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The company uses the Black-Scholes model to value its warrants. The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with such future payments. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs, of the contingent consideration.

The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The majority of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. See Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information on the company's risk management objectives and strategies. Cash Flow Hedge Arrangements In 2015, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt offering in 2016. Based on the company’s conclusion that a debt offering was probable as a result of debt maturing in 2016 and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a 10 -year term, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual fixed-rate interest payments on $1.00 billion of principal amount of the planned fixed-rate debt issue. The hedge was terminated in advance of completing a debt offering in April 2016 (Note 10 ). The fair value of the hedge at that time, $46 million , net of tax, was classified as a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive items and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt.

Restructuring and Other Costs, Net Restructuring and other costs in 2018 included continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including the closure and consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S. and Europe; third-party transaction/integration costs primarily related to recent acquisitions; sales of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; and environmental remediation charges. These charges were partially offset by gains on sales of real estate and favorable results of litigation. In 2018 , severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected approximately 1% of the company’s workforce. Restructuring and other costs in 2017 included continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including the closure and consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia; costs to achieve synergies related to acquisitions, including severance and abandoned facility costs; third-party acquisition transaction and integration costs primarily associated with the acquisitions of FEI and Patheon; sales of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; charges to conform the accounting policies of Patheon to the company's accounting policies; charges for changes in estimates of acquisition contingent consideration; hurricane response/impairment costs; net charges for the settlement/curtailment of retirement plans; and net credits for litigation matters. In 2017, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected less than 2% of the company’s workforce. Restructuring and other costs in 2016 included continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including the closure and consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia; third-party acquisition transaction and integration costs primarily associated with the acquisitions of FEI and Affymetrix; sales of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; costs to conform the accounting policies of FEI and Affymetrix to the company's accounting policies; costs to achieve synergies related to acquisitions, including severance and abandoned facility costs; and net charges for environmental and litigation-related matters. These charges were partially offset by gains on sales of assets. In 2016, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected less than 3% of the company’s workforce. As of February 27, 2019 , the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $65 million , primarily in 2019 , which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements and abandonment of leased facilities. 2018 During 2018, the company recorded net restructuring and other costs by segment as follows: (In millions) Cost of Revenues Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Restructuring and Other Costs, Net Total Life Sciences Solutions $ 4 $ 12 $ (17 ) $ (1 ) Analytical Instruments 3 8 28 39 Specialty Diagnostics — 3 (1 ) 2 Laboratory Products and Services 5 16 31 52 Corporate — (10 ) 9 (1 ) $ 12 $ 29 $ 50 $ 91 The principal components of net restructuring and other costs by segment are as follows: Life Sciences Solutions In 2018, the Life Sciences Solutions segment recorded $1 million of net restructuring and other income.
