Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material inter-company transactions among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 3, 2023. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2024 is a 52-week year ending on September 1, 2024. References to the first quarter of 2024 and 2023 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 26, 2023, and November 20, 2022. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Reclassification Reclassifications were made to the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the first twelve weeks of fiscal 2023 to conform with current year presentation. 8 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through additional disclosures about significant segment expenses. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is evaluating the disclosure requirements related to the new standard. Note 2—Investments The Company's investments were as follows: November 26, 2023: Cost Basis Unrealized Losses, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 665 $ ( 20 ) $ 645 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 208 — 208 Total short-term investments $ 873 $ ( 20 ) $ 853 September 3, 2023: Cost Basis Unrealized Losses, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 650 $ ( 17 ) $ 633 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 901 — 901 Total short-term investments $ 1,551 $ ( 17 ) $ 1,534 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the periods ended November 26, 2023, and September 3, 2023 . At those dates, there were no available-for-sale securities in a material continuous unrealized-loss position. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during the first quarter of 2024 or 2023. The maturities of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities at November 26, 2023, are as follows: Available-For-Sale Held-To-Maturity Cost Basis Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 120 $ 118 $ 208 Due after one year through five years 362 354 — Due after five years 183 173 — Total $ 665 $ 645 $ 208 Note 3—Fair Value Measurement Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The table below presents information regarding the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the level within the hierarchy reflecting the valuation techniques utilized. 9 Table of Contents Level 2 November 26, 2023 September 3, 2023 Investment in government and agency securities $ 645 $ 633 Forward foreign-exchange contracts, in asset position (1) 7 18 Forward foreign-exchange contracts, in (liability) position (1) ( 16 ) ( 7 ) Total $ 636 $ 644 _______________ (1) The asset and liability values are included in other current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. At November 26, 2023, and September 3, 2023, the Company did not hold any Level 1 or 3 financial assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between levels during the first quarter of 2024 or 2023. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. There were no material fair value adjustments to these items during the first quarter of 2024. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company recognized in merchandise costs a charge of $93, primarily related to the impairment of certain leased assets associated with charter shipping activities. Note 4—Debt The carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt consisted of the following: November 26, 2023 September 3, 2023 2.750 % Senior Notes due May 2024 $ 1,000 $ 1,000 3.000 % Senior Notes due May 2027 1,000 1,000 1.375 % Senior Notes due June 2027 1,250 1,250 1.600 % Senior Notes due April 2030 1,750 1,750 1.750 % Senior Notes due April 2032 1,000 1,000 Other long-term debt 972 484 Total long-term debt 6,972 6,484 Less unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 26 26 Less current portion (1) 1,080 1,081 Long-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,866 $ 5,377 _______________ (1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs . The fair value of the Senior Notes is estimated using Level 2 inputs. Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japan subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In November 2023, our Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $ 500 , at fixed interest rates ranging from 1.400 % to 2.120 %. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $ 6,234 and $ 5,738 at November 26, 2023, and September 3, 2023. 10 Table of Contents Note 5—Equity Dividends A quarterly cash dividend of $ 1.02 per share was declared on October 18, 2023, and paid on November 17, 2023. The dividend was $ 0.90 per share in the first quarter of 2023. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on December 13, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $ 15.00 per share, payable January 12, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 28, 2023. The aggregate amount of payments will be approximately $ 6.7 billion. Stock Repurchase Programs The Company's stock repurchase program is conducted under a $ 4,000 authorization by the Board of Directors, which expires in January 2027. At November 26, 2023, the remaining amount available under the program was $ 3,401 . The following table summarizes the repurchase activity: Shares Repurchased (000s) Average Price per Share Total Cost First quarter of 2024 288 $ 564.06 $ 162 First quarter of 2023 285 $ 495.94 $ 141 These amounts may differ from the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Note 6—Stock-Based Compensation The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of up to a maximum of 15,885,000 RSUs. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes. Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity At November 26, 2023, 7,097,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards were outstanding: • 2,726,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment over specified periods and accelerate upon achievement of a long-service term; • 69,000 performance-based RSUs granted to executive officers of the Company, for which the performance targets have been met. The awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time and upon achievement of a long-service term; and • 90,000 performance-based RSUs granted to executive officers of the Company, subject to achievement of performance targets for fiscal 2024, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors after the end of the fiscal year. These awards are not included in the table below or in the amount of unrecognized compensation cost. 11 Table of Contents The following table summarizes RSU transactions during the first quarter of 2024: Number of Units (in 000s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at September 3, 2023 3,045 $ 405.63 Granted 1,573 544.28 Vested and delivered ( 1,810 ) 430.49 Forfeited ( 13 ) 446.28 Outstanding at November 26, 2023 2,795 $ 467.39 The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs unvested at November 26, 2023, was $ 1,193 , and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.8 years. Summary of Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits: 12 Weeks Ended November 26, 2023 November 20, 2022 Stock-based compensation expense $ 444 $ 402 Less recognized income tax benefits 95 89 Stock-based compensation expense, net $ 349 $ 313 Note 7—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of basic and of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000s): 12 Weeks Ended November 26, 2023 November 20, 2022 Net income $ 1,589 $ 1,364 Weighted average basic shares 443,827 443,837 RSUs 576 694 Weighted average diluted shares 444,403 444,531 Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated based on the dilutive effect of RSUs using the treasury stock method. Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in many claims, proceedings and litigations arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be losses in excess of amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. The Company has recorded immaterial accruals with 12 Table of Contents respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but monitors for developments that make the contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. In September 2023, a former employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay minimum wage, to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods, to provide accurate wage statements, to timely pay final wages, to reimburse employee expenses, and for unfair business practices.

The settlement was granted final court approval on October 20, 2023. In July 2021, a former temporary staffing employee filed a class action against the Company and a staffing company, alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, the timeliness of wages and final wages, and for unfair business practices. Dimas v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. STK-CV-UOE-2021-0006024; San Joaquin Superior Court). The Company has moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual claims and to dismiss the class action complaint. On September 7, 2021, the same plaintiff filed a separate representative action under the California Private Attorneys General Act, asserting the same Labor Code violations and seeking civil 13 Table of Contents penalties and attorneys' fees. The case has been stayed pending arbitration of the plaintiff's individual claims. In September 2021, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding failure to provide sick pay, failure to timely pay wages due at separation from employment, and for violations of California's unfair competition law. De Benning v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 34-2021-00309030-CU-OE-GDS; Sacramento Superior Court). In April 2022, a settlement for an immaterial amount was agreed upon, subject to court approval.

Beginning in December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are cases filed against the Company by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and a hospital in Texas, class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 43 states and American Samoa. Claims against the Company filed in federal court outside the MDL have been asserted by certain counties and cities in Florida and Georgia; claims filed by certain cities and counties in New York are pending in state court. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, Utah, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of the pending matters. Members of the Board of Directors, six corporate officers and the Company were defendants in a shareholder derivative action filed in June 2022 related to chicken welfare and alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. Smith, et ano. v. Vachris, et al., Superior Court of the State of Washington, County of King, No, 22-2-08937-7SEA. The complaint sought from the individual defendants' damages, injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys' fees. On March 28, 2023, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the action. The plaintiffs subsequently made a demand that the Board of Directors take various actions, including among other things, pursuing claims against directors and officers of the type asserted in the litigation. A demand review committee of the Board has been appointed to make a recommendation to the Board as to the demand. In February 2023, Go Green Norcal, LLC filed an arbitration demand against the Company. The demand alleged a breach of a supply agreement and sought unspecified damages and cancellation of a loan from the Company. In March 2023, the Company filed its answer, denying any breach by the Company, along with counterclaims against Go Green and an affiliate for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and an accounting. In August 2023 the plaintiff asserted that its damages exceed $ 70 million. Between September 25, 2023, and October 21, 2023, five class action suits were filed against the Company alleging various privacy law violations stemming from pixel trackers on Costco.com. Birdwell v. Costco , Case No. T23-1405, Contra Costa County Superior Court; Castillo v. Costco , Case No. 2:34-cv-01548 (W.D. Wash.); Groves et ano. v. Costco , Case No. 2:23-cv-01662 (W.D. Wash.); R.S. v, Costco , Case No. 2:23-cv-01628; Stock v. Costco , Case No. 2:23-cv-08808 (C.D. Cal.). The complaints seek damages, equitable relief and attorneys’ fees under various statutes, including the Washington Consumer Protection Act, Washington Privacy Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act, California Invasion of Privacy Act, and California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. They also allege breach of implied 14 Table of Contents contract, breach of fiduciary duty of confidentiality, unjust enrichment, negligence, and invasion of privacy. The Company has not yet responded to the complaints. In October 2021 the Company received a notice that the Quebec Health Insurance Board had commenced an inquiry to determine whether the Company had given or received improper payments for drugs that are covered by the province's prescription drug program from drug wholesalers, generic drug manufacturers or the independent pharmacist who owns and operates the pharmacies located in the Company's Quebec locations. The inquiry covers a period beginning January 1, 2017. In January 2023 the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Attorney's Office, Western District of Washington, requesting documents. The government is conducting a False Claims Act investigation concerning whether the Company presented or caused to be presented to the federal government for payment false claims relating to prescription medications. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 15 Table of Contents Note 9—Segment Reporting The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 3, 2023, and Note 1 above.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. OVERVIEW The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), as well as our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements, and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on October 11, 2023. We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts. We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). Comparable sales is 17 Table of Contents defined as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. The measure is intended as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations); inflation or deflation and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage and lower SG&A expense, relative to our non-gasoline businesses. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Government actions in various countries relating to tariffs, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business, domestically and internationally, generally has a lower gross margin percentage than our warehouse operations. The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, 18 Table of Contents and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid-membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's exchange rates. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's average price per gallon sold. Results expressed excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and gasoline prices are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be reviewed in conjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the first quarter of 2024 and 2023 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 26, 2023, and November 20, 2022. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Highlights for the first quarter of 2024 versus 2023 include: • Net sales increased 6% to $56,717, driven by a 4% increase in comparable sales and sales at 25 net new warehouses opened since the end of the first quarter of 2023; • Membership fee revenue increased 8% to $1,082, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive Membership, and a higher renewal rate; • Gross margin percentage increased 43 basis points, driven primarily by our warehouse operations and other businesses and the absence of a charge of $93, $0.15 per diluted share, predominantly related to the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2023; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 25 basis points, primarily due to increased costs in warehouse operations and other businesses, including the impact of wage increases in March and September 2023; • The provision for income taxes in the first quarter of 2024 was positively impacted by a benefit related to stock compensation of $44, $0.10 per diluted share, compared to $53, $0.12 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2023; • Net income was $1,589, $3.58 per diluted share, compared to $1,364, $3.07 per diluted share in 2023; • A quarterly cash dividend of $1.02 per share was declared on October 18, 2023, and paid on November 17, 2023; and • Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on December 13, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $15.00 per share, payable January 12, 2024. 19 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 12 Weeks Ended November 26, 2023 November 20, 2022 Net Sales $ 56,717 $ 53,437 Changes in net sales: U.S. 4 % 11 % Canada 7 % 3 % Other International 16 % — % Total Company 6 % 8 % Changes in comparable sales: U.S. 2 % 9 % Canada 6 % 2 % Other International 11 % (3) % Total Company 4 % 7 % E-commerce 6 % (4) % Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-currency and gasoline prices: U.S. 3 % 7 % Canada 8 % 8 % Other International 7 % 9 % Total Company 4 % 7 % E-commerce 6 % (2) % Net Sales Net sales increased $3,280 or 6%, during the first quarter of 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 4%, and sales at the 25 net new warehouses opened since the end of the first quarter of 2023. Sales increased $2,921, or 7% in core merchandise categories, led by fresh foods and foods and sundries. Sales in warehouse ancillary and other businesses increased $359, or 3%, led by pharmacy. During the first quarter of 2024, l ower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $341, 64 basis points, compared to 2023, with a 4% decrease in the average price per gallon. C hanges in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $195, 36 basis points, compared to the first quarter of 2023, attributable to our Other International operations, partially offset by our Canadian operations. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 4% in the first quarter of 2024 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight decrease in average ticket. 20 Table of Contents Membership Fees 12 Weeks Ended November 26, 2023 November 20, 2022 Membership fees $ 1,082 $ 1,000 Membership fees increase 8 % 6 % Total paid members (000s) 72,000 66,900 Total cardholders (000s) 129,500 120,900 Membership fee revenue increased 8%, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive Membership, and a higher renewal rate. At the end of the first quarter of 2024, our renewal rates were 92.8% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide. Renewal rates benefited from higher penetration of Executive members. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Gross Margin 12 Weeks Ended November 26, 2023 November 20, 2022 Net sales $ 56,717 $ 53,437 Less merchandise costs 50,457 47,769 Gross margin $ 6,260 $ 5,668 Gross margin percentage 11.04 % 10.61 % Gross margin percentage increased 43 basis points. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 10.97%, an increase of 36 basis points. The 36 basis-point increase was positively impacted by: 22 basis points related to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, primarily gasoline and e-commerce; 17 basis points due to the absence of a charge related to the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities that was recorded in the first quarter of 2023; and three basis points due to a LIFO benefit. These were partially offset by: three basis points due to core merchandise categories, predominantly fresh foods; and three basis points due to increased 2% rewards. The gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased five basis points. The increase was primarily due to non-foods, partially offset by fresh foods and foods and sundries. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased across all segments. Our U.S. segment performed similarly to the results above. The increases in our Canadian and Other International segments were primarily due to increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses and core merchandise categories. All segments were negatively impacted by increased 2% rewards. 21 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 12 Weeks Ended November 26, 2023 November 20, 2022 SG&A expenses $ 5,358 $ 4,917 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 9.45 % 9.20 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 25 basis points. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation was 9.39%, an increase of 19 basis points. The comparison to last year was negatively impacted by 14 basis points in warehouse operations and other businesses which included the impact of wage increases in March and September 2023. Stock compensation and preopening costs were each higher by two basis points, and central operating costs were higher by one basis point. Interest Expense 12 Weeks Ended November 26, 2023 November 20, 2022 Interest expense $ 38 $ 34 Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes and financing leases. Interest Income and Other, Net 12 Weeks Ended November 26, 2023 November 20, 2022 Interest income $ 154 $ 54 Foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), net 3 (9) Other, net 3 8 Interest income and other, net $ 160 $ 53 The increase in interest income in the first quarter was due to higher global interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances. Foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), net, include revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations and mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts. See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Item 8, Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 3, 2023. Provision for Income Taxes 12 Weeks Ended November 26, 2023 November 20, 2022 Provision for income taxes $ 517 $ 406 Effective tax rate 24.5 % 23.0 % The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $40, primarily due to excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.4% for the first quarter of 2024. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $56, primarily due to excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.1% for the first quarter of 2023. 22 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 12 Weeks Ended November 26, 2023 November 20, 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,651 $ 2,610 Net cash used in investing activities (366) (1,057) Net cash used in financing activities (974) (863) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $17,864 and $15,234 at November 26, 2023, and September 3, 2023. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $2,603 and $2,282 at November 26, 2023, and September 3, 2023. These receivables generally settle within four days. Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. Construction and land purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to the development and opening of new and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months. Management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows with capacity under existing and available credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $4,651 in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $2,610 in the first quarter of 2023. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including inventory levels and turnover, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $366 in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $1,057 in the first quarter of 2023, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Expenditure Plans Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first quarter of 2024, we spent $1,040 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $4,400 to $4,600 during fiscal 2024. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 10 new warehouses, including one relocation, in the 23 Table of Contents first quarter of 2024 and plan to open 23 additional new warehouses, including one relocation, in the remainder of fiscal 2024. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs and the economic environment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $974 in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $863 in the first quarter of 2023. Cash flow used in financing activities during the first quarter of 2024 was primarily related to the payment of dividends, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, and repurchases of common stock. In November 2023, our Japanese subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes totaling approximately $500 at fixed interest rates ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Dividends A quarterly cash dividend of $1.02 per share was declared on October 18, 2023, payable to shareholders of record on November 3, 2023, which was paid on November 17, 2023. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on December 13, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $15.00 per share, payable January 12, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 28, 2023. The aggregate amount of payments will be approximately $6.7 billion. Share Repurchase Program On January 19, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, which expires in January 2027. During the first quarter of 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 288,000 and 285,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $564.06 and $495.94, totaling approximately $162 and $141. These amounts may differ from the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,401 at the end of the first quarter. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At November 26, 2023, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,245. Our international operations maintain $757 of this capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $163 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities, which are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, were immaterial at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and at the end of fiscal 2023. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $223. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the first quarter of 2024 totaled $188, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base these on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report 24 Table of Contents on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 3, 2023.

There have been no material changes to our market risks as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 3, 2023. Item 4—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 26, 2023, and, based on their evaluation, have concluded the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

share, per share, and warehouse count data) (unaudited) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At May 7, 2023, Costco operated 852 warehouses worldwide: 586 in the United States (U.S.) located in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 107 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 32 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 18 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 14 in Australia, four in Spain, three in China, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and a subsidiary in which it has a controlling interest. All material inter-company transactions among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2022. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2023 is a 53-week year ending on September 3, 2023. References to the third quarter of 2023 and 2022 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended May 7, 2023, and May 8, 2022. References to the first thirty-six weeks of 2023 and 2022 relate to the 36 weeks ended May 7, 2023, and May 8, 2022. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 9 Table of Contents Reclassification Reclassifications were made to the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the first thirty-six weeks of 2022 to conform with current year presentation. Leases The Company leases land, buildings, equipment, and other assets at warehouses, offices, or within the operations that support supply chain and distribution channels. The Company reviews lease right-of-use assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. The Company also occasionally revisits and modifies the terms of its leasing arrangements. During the first quarter and third quarter of 2023, the Company recognized charges of $ 93 and $ 298 , primarily related to the impairment of certain leased assets associated with charter shipping activities. This charge is included in merchandise costs. Note 2—Investments The Company's investments were as follows: May 7, 2023: Cost Basis Unrealized Losses, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 602 $ ( 2 ) $ 600 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 615 — 615 Total short-term investments $ 1,217 $ ( 2 ) $ 1,215 August 28, 2022: Cost Basis Unrealized Losses, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 534 $ ( 5 ) $ 529 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 317 — 317 Total short-term investments $ 851 $ ( 5 ) $ 846 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the periods ended May 7, 2023, and August 28, 2022 . At those dates, there were no available-for-sale securities in a material continuous unrealized-loss position. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during the first thirty-six weeks of 2023 or 2022. The maturities of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities at May 7, 2023 are as follows: Available-For-Sale Held-To-Maturity Cost Basis Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 126 $ 125 $ 615 Due after one year through five years 324 324 — Due after five years 152 151 — Total $ 602 $ 600 $ 615 10 Table of Contents Note 3—Fair Value Measurement Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The table below presents information regarding financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the level within the fair-value hierarchy reflecting the valuation techniques utilized.

At May 7, 2023, and August 28, 2022, the Company did not hold any Level 1 or 3 financial assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between levels during the first thirty-six weeks of 2023 or 2022. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. Please see Note 1 for additional information. Note 4—Debt The carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt consisted of the following: May 7, 2023 August 28, 2022 2.750 % Senior Notes due May 2024 $ 1,000 $ 1,000 3.000 % Senior Notes due May 2027 1,000 1,000 1.375 % Senior Notes due June 2027 1,250 1,250 1.600 % Senior Notes due April 2030 1,750 1,750 1.750 % Senior Notes due April 2032 1,000 1,000 Other long-term debt 525 590 Total long-term debt 6,525 6,590 Less unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 28 33 Less current portion (1) — 73 Long-term debt, excluding current portion $ 6,497 $ 6,484 _______________ (1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs . The fair value of the Senior Notes is estimated using Level 2 inputs. Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japan subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $ 5,907 and $ 6,033 at May 7, 2023, and August 28, 2022. 11 Table of Contents Note 5—Equity Dividends A quarterly cash dividend of $ 1.02 per share was declared on April 19, 2023 and paid on May 19, 2023.

Share Repurchase Program The Company's share repurchase program is conducted under a $ 4,000 authorization by the Board of Directors, which expires in January 2027. At May 7, 2023, the remaining amount available under the program was $ 3,793 . The following table summarizes the Company's stock repurchase activity: Shares Repurchased (000s) Average Price per Share Total Cost Third quarter of 2023 329 $ 492.71 $ 162 First thirty-six weeks of 2023 908 $ 492.30 $ 447 Third quarter of 2022 254 $ 547.38 $ 139 First thirty-six weeks of 2022 490 $ 523.61 $ 257 These amounts may differ from the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Note 6—Stock-Based Compensation The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares ( 10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum of 27,800,000 shares ( 15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes. Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity At May 7, 2023, 8,724,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards were outstanding: • 2,898,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment over specified periods and accelerate upon achievement of a long-service term; • 41,000 performance-based RSUs granted to executive officers of the Company, for which the performance targets have been met.

These awards are included in the table below. The Company recognized compensation expense for these awards in the third quarter of 2023, as it is currently deemed probable that the targets will be achieved. 12 Table of Contents The following table summarizes RSU transactions during the first thirty-six weeks of 2023: Number of Units (in 000s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at August 28, 2022 3,449 $ 338.41 Granted 1,814 471.47 Vested and delivered ( 2,096 ) 352.56 Forfeited ( 93 ) 396.50 Outstanding at May 7, 2023 3,074 $ 405.51 The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs unvested at May 7, 2023, was $ 930 , and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.7 years.

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. The Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will monitor the matter for developments that will make the contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in an action commenced in July 2013 under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to employees who work at entrance and exit doors in California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2013-1-CV-248813; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. On April 26, 2023, the court entered a final judgment in favor of the Company. In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that depot employees in California did not receive suitable seating or reasonably comfortable workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. CIVDS 1908816; San Bernardino Superior Court). In October 2019, the parties settled for an immaterial amount the seating claims on a representative basis, which received court approval in February 2020. The parties settled the temperature claims for an immaterial amount in April 2022, and court approval was received in May 2022.

Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-03454; C.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2019, the court issued an order denying class certification. In January 2020, the plaintiffs dismissed their Labor Code claims without prejudice, and the court remanded the action to state court. Settlement for an immaterial amount was agreed upon in February 2021. Final court approval of the settlement was granted on May 3, 2022. A proposed intervenor appealed the denial of her motion to intervene. Her appeal was dismissed on February 15, 2023. 14 Table of Contents In May 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices.

In May 2022, an employee filed a PAGA-only representative action against the Company alleging claims under the California Labor Code regarding the payment of wages, meal and rest periods, the timeliness of wages and final wages, wage statements, accurate records and business expenses. Gonzalez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 22AHCV00255; Los Angeles Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the allegations. Beginning in December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are cases filed against the Company by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and a hospital in Texas, class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 43 states and American Samoa. Claims against the Company filed in federal court outside the MDL have been asserted by certain counties and cities in Florida and Georgia; claims filed by certain cities and counties in New York are pending in state court. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, Utah, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of the pending matters. Members of the Board of Directors, six corporate officers and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action filed in June 2022 related to chicken welfare and alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. Smith, et ano. v. Vachris , et al., Superior Court of the State of Washington, County of King, No, 22-2-08937-7SEA. The complaint seeks from the individual defendants damages, injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys' fees. On March 28, 2023, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the action. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 16 Table of Contents Note 9—Segment Reporting The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Japan, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Spain, France, China, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2022, and Note 1 above. Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

OVERVIEW The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), as well as our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements, and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on October 5, 2022. We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts. We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define 18 Table of Contents comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations); inflation and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in the third quarter of 2023 continued to be impacted by inflation. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, as well as passing cost increases on to our members. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline businesses. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline businesses. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, government actions in various countries relating to tariffs, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business, domestically and internationally, generally has a lower gross margin percentage than our warehouse operations. The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, 19 Table of Contents and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid-membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction require maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's currency exchange rates. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's average price per gallon sold. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the third quarter of 2023 and 2022 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended May 7, 2023, and May 8, 2022. References to the first thirty-six weeks of 2023 and 2022 relate to the 36 weeks ended May 7, 2023, and May 8, 2022. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Highlights for the third quarter of 2023 versus 2022 include: • Net sales increased 2% to $52,604, driven by sales at 23 net new warehouses opened since the end of the third quarter of 2022; • Membership fee revenue increased 6% to $1,044, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive Membership, and a higher renewal rate; • Gross margin percentage increased 13 basis points, driven primarily by our core merchandise categories and the absence of a LIFO charge as was recorded in the third quarter of 2022. This was partially offset by a charge of $298, $0.50 per diluted share, predominantly related to the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 49 basis points, due to increased costs in warehouse operations and other businesses, primarily wages and benefits, driven by various wage increases effective in March and July 2022, and March 2023, as well as slower sales growth; • In the third quarter of 2022 we incurred a one-time $77 pretax charge, $0.13 per diluted share, related to granting our employees additional vacation; • Net income was $1,302, $2.93 per diluted share, compared to $1,353, $3.04 per diluted share in 2022; and • A quarterly cash dividend of $1.02 per share was declared on April 19, 2023 and paid on May 19, 2023. 20 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 7, 2023 May 8, 2022 May 7, 2023 May 8, 2022 Net Sales $ 52,604 $ 51,612 $ 160,280 $ 151,966 Changes in net sales: U.S. 1 % 18 % 6 % 17 % Canada — % 16 % 2 % 17 % Other International 8 % 9 % 5 % 12 % Total Company 2 % 16 % 5 % 16 % Changes in comparable sales: U.S. — % 17 % 5 % 16 % Canada (1) % 15 % 2 % 16 % Other International 4 % 6 % 2 % 8 % Total Company — % 15 % 4 % 15 % E-commerce (10) % 7 % (8) % 11 % Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-currency and gasoline prices: U.S. 2 % 11 % 5 % 11 % Canada 7 % 13 % 8 % 11 % Other International 8 % 9 % 9 % 10 % Total Company 3 % 11 % 6 % 11 % E-commerce (9) % 8 % (7) % 11 % Net Sales Net sales increased $992 or 2%, and $8,314 or 5% during the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2023. The improvement in the third quarter of 2023 was attributable to sales at the 23 net new warehouses opened since the end of the third quarter of 2022. The increase in net sales for the first thirty-six weeks of 2023 was driven primarily by a 4% increase in comparable sales. Sales increased $1,362, or 3% and $5,885, or 5% in core merchandise categories during the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2023, led by foods and sundries and fresh foods; while non-foods decreased. Sales in warehouse ancillary and other businesses decreased $370, or 3% during the third quarter of 2023, due to lower gasoline prices, partially offset by increases in pharmacy, travel, food court and optical. Sales increased $2,429, or 8% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses during the first thirty-six weeks of 2023, led by gasoline, pharmacy and travel. During the third quarter of 2023, l ower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $862, 167 basis points, compared to 2022, with a 12% decrease in the average price per gallon. T he volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $86, 17 basis points. C hanges in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $782, 152 basis points, compared to the third quarter of 2022, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. 21 Table of Contents During the first thirty-six weeks of 2023, higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $392, 26 basis points, compared to 2022, with a slight increase in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 7%, positively impacting net sales by $1,301, 86 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $3,253, 214 basis points, compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2022, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. Comparable Sales Comparable sales were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, largely offset by a decrease in average ticket in the third quarter of 2023. Comparable sales increased 4% in the first thirty-six weeks of 2023, driven by an increase in shopping frequency. Membership Fees 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 7, 2023 May 8, 2022 May 7, 2023 May 8, 2022 Membership fees $ 1,044 $ 984 $ 3,071 $ 2,897 Membership fees increase 6 % 9 % 6 % 10 % Total paid members (000s) 69,100 64,400 — — Total cardholders (000s) 124,700 116,600 — — Membership fee revenue increased 6% in both the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2023, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive Membership, and a higher renewal rate. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted membership fees by $17 and $70 in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2023. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, our renewal rates were 92.6% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide. Renewal rates continue to benefit from more members auto renewing and increased penetration of Executive members, who on average renew at a higher rate. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Our membership counts include active memberships and memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. Gross Margin 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 7, 2023 May 8, 2022 May 7, 2023 May 8, 2022 Net sales $ 52,604 $ 51,612 $ 160,280 $ 151,966 Less merchandise costs 47,175 46,355 143,367 135,824 Gross margin $ 5,429 $ 5,257 $ 16,913 $ 16,142 Gross margin percentage 10.32 % 10.19 % 10.55 % 10.62 % Quarterly Results Total gross margin percentage increased 13 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 10.16%, a decrease of three basis points. This was driven by a net 52 basis-point decrease due to a charge, primarily for the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities and the benefit from the absence of a charge related to granting employees additional vacation as was recorded in the third quarter of 2022. Increased 2% rewards negatively impacted gross margin by nine basis points. Gross margin was positively impacted by 25 basis points due to the absence of a LIFO charge as was recorded in the third quarter of 2022. Core merchandise categories positively impacted gross margin by 24 basis points, due to foods and sundries, 22 Table of Contents partially offset by non-foods. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses positively impacted gross margin by nine basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $81, compared to the third quarter of 2022, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. The gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 17 basis points. The increase was primarily due to foods and sundries and non-foods, partially offset by fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), performed similarly to the consolidated results above in our U.S. segment. Gross margin percentage increased in our Canadian and Other International segment due to increases in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses. All segments were negatively impacted by increased 2% rewards. Year-to-date Results Total gross margin percentage decreased seven basis points compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2022. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 10.58%, a decrease of four basis points. This was driven by charges in the first and third quarters of 2023 related to the downsizing and then discontinuation of our charter shipping activities, totaling 24 basis points. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by five basis points due to increased 2% rewards and three basis points due to decreases in core merchandise categories, predominantly in non-foods and fresh foods, partially offset by foods and sundries. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses, positively impacted gross margin by 14 basis points, predominantly gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce. A smaller LIFO charge in the first thirty-six weeks of 2023 compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2022 also positively impacted gross margin by 14 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $325, compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2022, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. The gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 14 basis points. The decrease was primarily due to fresh foods and non-foods, partially offset by foods and sundries. Gross margin percentage was flat in our U.S. segment due to the charge related to the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities discussed above, offset by a smaller LIFO charge and increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, primarily gasoline. Gross margin percentage decreased in our Canadian and Other International segment due to decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by warehouse ancillary and other businesses. All segments were negatively impacted by increased 2% rewards. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 7, 2023 May 8, 2022 May 7, 2023 May 8, 2022 SG&A expenses $ 4,794 $ 4,450 $ 14,651 $ 13,743 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 9.11 % 8.62 % 9.14 % 9.04 % 23 Table of Contents Quarterly Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 49 basis points. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation was 8.96%, an increase of 34 basis points. The comparison to last year was negatively impacted by 35 basis points in warehouse operations and other businesses, largely attributable to the increased wages and benefits that were effective in March and July 2022, and March 2023 and slower sales growth. Central operating costs were also higher by nine basis points, and preopening costs were higher by one basis point. SG&A was positively impacted by 11 basis points due to the absence of a charge related to granting our employees additional vacation as was recorded in the prior year. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased SG&A expenses by approximately $65 compared to the third quarter of 2022. Year-to-date Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was 9.16%, an increase of 12 basis points. The comparison to last year was negatively impacted by 16 basis points in warehouse operations and other businesses, largely attributable to the increased wages and benefits that were effective in March and July 2022, and March 2023 and slower sales growth. Central operating costs were also higher by seven basis points. SG&A was positively impacted by 11 basis points due to the absence of a write-off of certain information technology assets and a charge related to granting our employees additional vacation as were recorded in the prior year. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased SG&A expenses by approximately $261 compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2022. Interest Expense 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 7, 2023 May 8, 2022 May 7, 2023 May 8, 2022 Interest expense $ 36 $ 35 $ 104 $ 110 Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes and financing leases. The decrease in interest expense for the first thirty-six weeks of 2023 was due to repayment of the 2.300% Senior Notes on December 1, 2021. Interest Income and Other, Net 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 7, 2023 May 8, 2022 May 7, 2023 May 8, 2022 Interest income $ 110 $ 6 $ 269 $ 21 Foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), net 9 56 3 94 Other, net 9 9 23 23 Interest income and other, net $ 128 $ 71 $ 295 $ 138 The increase in interest income in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2023 was due to higher global interest rates. Foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), net, include mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts and the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations. See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Item 8, Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2022. 24 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 7, 2023 May 8, 2022 May 7, 2023 May 8, 2022 Provision for income taxes $ 469 $ 455 $ 1,392 $ 1,287 Effective tax rate 26.5 % 24.9 % 25.2 % 24.2 % The effective tax rate for the first thirty-six weeks of 2023 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $57, primarily due to excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.2%. The effective tax rate for the first thirty-six weeks of 2022 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $114, primarily due to excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.3%. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 36 Weeks Ended May 7, 2023 May 8, 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,343 $ 4,886 Net cash used in investing activities (3,147) (2,428) Net cash used in financing activities (1,950) (2,343) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $13,708 and $11,049 at May 7, 2023, and August 28, 2022. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $2,236 and $2,010 at May 7, 2023, and August 28, 2022. These receivables generally settle within four days. Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. Construction and land purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to the development and opening of new and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months. Management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows with capacity under existing and available credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. 25 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $7,343 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2023, compared to $4,886 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2022. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including inventory turnover, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $3,147 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2023, compared to $2,428 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2022, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Expenditure Plans Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first thirty-six weeks of 2023, we spent $2,767 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $3,800 to $4,200 during fiscal 2023. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 17 new warehouses, including three relocations, in the first thirty-six weeks of 2023 and plan to open nine additional new warehouses in the remainder of fiscal 2023. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs and the economic environment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,950 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2023, compared to $2,343 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2022. Cash flow used in financing activities during the first thirty-six weeks of 2023 was primarily related to the payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, and withholding taxes on stock-based awards. In the first thirty-six weeks of 2022, cash flow used in financing activities included the repayment of our 2.300% Senior Notes and the payment of dividends. Dividends A quarterly cash dividend of $1.02 per share was declared on April 19, 2023, payable to shareholders of record on May 5, 2023, which was paid on May 19, 2023. Share Repurchase Program On January 19, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, which expires in January 2027. During the first thirty-six weeks of 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 908,000 and 490,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $492.30 and $523.61, totaling approximately $447 and $257. These amounts may differ from the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,793 at the end of the third quarter. 26 Table of Contents Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At May 7, 2023, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,312. Our international operations maintain $824 of this capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $174 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities, which are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, were $54 and $88 at the end of the third quarter of 2023 and at the end of fiscal 2022. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $226. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the third quarter of 2023 totaled $189, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base these on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2022. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in that Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements There have been no material changes in recently issued or adopted accounting standards from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2022. Item 3—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our direct exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates and interest rates. There have been no material changes to our market risks as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2022. Item 4—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of May 7, 2023 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 27 Table of Contents PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1—Legal Proceedings See discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.

share, per share, and warehouse count data) (unaudited) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At February 12, 2023, Costco operated 848 warehouses worldwide: 584 in the United States (U.S.) located in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 107 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 31 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 18 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 14 in Australia, four in Spain, two each in France and China, and one each in Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and a subsidiary in which it has a controlling interest. All material inter-company transactions among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2022. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2023 is a 53-week year ending on September 3, 2023. References to the second quarter of 2023 and 2022 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended February 12, 2023, and February 13, 2022. References to the first half of 2023 and 2022 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 12, 2023 and February 13, 2022. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 9 Table of Contents Reclassification Reclassifications were made to the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the first half of 2022 to conform with current year presentation. Leases The Company leases land, buildings, equipment, and other assets at warehouses, offices, or within the operations that support supply chain and distribution channels. The Company reviews lease right-of-use assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. The Company also occasionally revisits and modifies the terms of its leasing arrangements. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company recognized a charge of $ 93 , primarily related to the termination costs and impairment of certain leased assets associated with charter shipping activities. This charge is included in merchandise costs. Note 2—Investments The Company's investments were as follows: February 12, 2023: Cost Basis Unrealized Losses, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 595 $ ( 11 ) $ 584 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 151 — 151 Total short-term investments $ 746 $ ( 11 ) $ 735 August 28, 2022: Cost Basis Unrealized Losses, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 534 $ ( 5 ) $ 529 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 317 — 317 Total short-term investments $ 851 $ ( 5 ) $ 846 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the periods ended February 12, 2023, and August 28, 2022 .

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. The Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will monitor the matter for developments that will make the contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in an action commenced in July 2013 under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to employees who work at entrance and exit doors in California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2013-1-CV-248813; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. On January 19, 2023, the court issued a Proposed/Tentative Statement of Decision Following Court Trial finding in favor of Costco. The plaintiff filed a request for further statement of decision and objections to the tentative decision. The parties are awaiting the court's review of plaintiff's filings and Costco's response thereto, after which the court will decide if it requires a hearing before a final decision issues. In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that depot employees in California did not receive suitable seating or reasonably comfortable workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. CIVDS 1908816; San Bernardino Superior Court). In October 2019, the parties settled for an immaterial amount the seating claims on a representative basis, which received court approval in February 2020. The parties settled the temperature claims for an immaterial amount in April 2022, and court approval was received in May 2022. In June 2022, a business center employee raised similar claims, alleging failure to provide seating to employees who work at membership refund desks in California warehouses and business centers. Rodriguez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 22CV012847; Alameda Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In March 2019, employees filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods and itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-03454; C.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2019, the court issued an order denying class certification. In January 2020, the plaintiffs dismissed their Labor Code claims without prejudice, and the court remanded the action to state court. Settlement for an immaterial amount was agreed upon in 14 Table of Contents February 2021. Final court approval of the settlement was granted on May 3, 2022. A proposed intervenor appealed the denial of her motion to intervene. Her appeal was dismissed on February 15, 2023. In May 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 2:19-cv-01340; E.D. Cal.). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. In September 2021, the court granted Costco’s motion for partial summary judgment and denied class certification. In August 2019, the plaintiff filed a companion case in state court seeking penalties under PAGA. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. FCS053454; Sonoma County Superior Court). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The state court action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal action. In December 2020, a former employee filed suit against the Company asserting collective and class claims on behalf of non-exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York Labor Law for failure to pay for all hours worked, failure to pay certain non-exempt employees on a weekly basis, and failure to provide proper wage statements and notices. The plaintiff also asserted individual retaliation claims. Cappadora v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 1:20-cv-06067; E.D.N.Y.). An amended complaint was filed, and the Company denied the material allegations of the amended complaint. Based on an agreement in principle concerning settlement of the matter, involving a proposed payment by the Company of an immaterial amount, the federal action has been dismissed. In April 2022, Cappadora and a second plaintiff filed an action against the Company in New York state court, asserting the same class claims asserted in the federal action under the New York Labor Law and seeking preliminary approval of the class settlement. Cappadora and Sancho v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Index No. 604757/2022; Nassau County Supreme Court). The state court granted preliminary approval of the settlement in October 2022. A final approval hearing is set for March 27, 2023. In August 2021, a former employee filed a similar suit, asserting class claims on behalf of certain non-exempt employees under New York Labor Law for failure to pay on a weekly basis. Umadat v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:21-cv-4814; E.D.N.Y.). The Company filed an answer, denying the material allegations of the complaint.

In September 2022, an amended complaint was filed, asserting class claims on behalf of certain non-exempt employees under New York Labor Law for failure to pay on a weekly basis. The Company responded by requesting permission to file a motion to dismiss. The court stayed the action pending the class settlement in the Cappadora matter noted above. In February 2021, a former employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, reimbursement of expenses, payment of final wages to terminated employees, and for unfair business practices. Edwards v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 5:21-cv-00716: C.D. Cal.). In May 2021, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted with leave to amend. In June 2021, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which the Company moved to dismiss. The court granted the motion in part in July 2021 with leave to amend. In August 2021, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint and filed a separate representative action under PAGA asserting the same Labor Code claims and seeking civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The Company filed an answer to the second amended class action complaint, denying the material allegations. The Company also filed an answer to the PAGA representative action, denying the material allegations. On September 27, 2022, the parties reached a settlement for an immaterial amount. The settlement requires court approval. In July 2021, a former temporary staffing employee filed a class action against the Company and a staffing company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, the timeliness of wages and final wages, and for unfair business practices. Dimas v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. STK-CV-UOE-2021-0006024; San Joaquin Superior Court). 15 Table of Contents The Company has moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual claims and to dismiss the class action complaint. On September 7, 2021, the same former employee filed a separate representative action under PAGA, asserting the same Labor Code violations and seeking civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The case has been stayed pending resolution of the motion to compel in the related case. In September 2021, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding failure to provide sick pay, failure to timely pay wages due at separation from employment, and for violations of California's unfair competition law. De Benning v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 34-2021-00309030-CU-OE-GDS; Sacramento Superior Court). The Company answered the complaint in January 2022, denying its material allegations.

In December 2022, the case was settled for an immaterial amount. In May 2022, an employee filed a PAGA-only representative action against the Company alleging claims under the California Labor Code regarding the payment of wages, meal and rest periods, the timeliness of wages and final wages, wage statements, accurate records and business expenses. Gonzalez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 22AHCV00255; Los Angeles Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the allegations. Beginning in December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and a hospital in Texas, class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 43 states and American Samoa. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, Utah, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of the pending matters. Members of the Board of Directors, six corporate officers and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action filed in June 2022 related to chicken welfare and alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. Smith, et ano. v. Vachris , et al., Superior Court of the State of Washington, County of King, No, 22-2-08937-7SEA. The complaint seeks from the individual defendants damages, injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys' fees. A motion to dismiss the amended complaint has been filed. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 16 Table of Contents Note 9—Segment Reporting The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Japan, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Spain, France, China, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2022, and Note 1 above.

OVERVIEW The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), as well as our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements, and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on October 5, 2022. We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts. We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define 18 Table of Contents comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations); inflation and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in the second quarter of 2023 continued to be impacted by inflation. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, as well as passing cost increases on to our members. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline businesses. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline businesses. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, government actions in various countries relating to tariffs, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business, domestically and internationally, generally has a lower gross margin percentage than our warehouse operations. 19 Table of Contents The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid-membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction require maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's currency exchange rates. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's average price per gallon sold. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the second quarter of 2023 and 2022 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended February 12, 2023, and February 13, 2022. References to the first half of 2023 and 2022 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 12, 2023, and February 13, 2022. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Highlights for the second quarter of 2023 versus 2022 include: • Net sales increased 6% to $54,239, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 5% and sales at 20 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of 2022; • Membership fee revenue increased 6% to $1,027, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive Membership, and a higher renewal rate; • Gross margin percentage increased eight basis points, driven primarily by a LIFO charge recorded in the second quarter of 2022. This was partially offset by decreases in core merchandise categories; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 13 basis points, primarily due to central operating costs; • Net income was $1,466, $3.30 per diluted share, compared to $1,299, $2.92 per diluted share in 2022; and • A quarterly cash dividend of $0.90 per share was declared on January 19, 2023 and paid on February 17, 2023. 20 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 12, 2023 February 13, 2022 February 12, 2023 February 13, 2022 Net Sales $ 54,239 $ 50,937 $ 107,676 $ 100,354 Changes in net sales: U.S 7 % 17 % 9 % 17 % Canada 4 % 17 % 4 % 18 % Other International 7 % 10 % 4 % 14 % Total Company 6 % 16 % 7 % 16 % Changes in comparable sales: U.S 6 % 16 % 8 % 15 % Canada 4 % 16 % 3 % 17 % Other International 4 % 6 % — % 10 % Total Company 5 % 14 % 6 % 15 % E-commerce (10) % 13 % (7) % 13 % Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-currency and gasoline prices: U.S 6 % 11 % 6 % 11 % Canada 10 % 12 % 9 % 10 % Other International 10 % 9 % 9 % 10 % Total Company 7 % 11 % 7 % 11 % E-commerce (9) % 13 % (6) % 13 % Net Sales Net sales increased $3,302 or 6%, and $7,322 or 7% during the second quarter and first half of 2023. This improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 5% and 6% in the second quarter and first half of 2023, and sales at the 20 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of 2022. Sales increased $2,490, or 6% and $4,523, or 6% in core merchandise categories during the second quarter and first half of 2023, led by foods and sundries and fresh foods; while non-foods decreased. Sales increased $812, or 9% and $2,799, or 15% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses during the second quarter and first half of 2023, led by gasoline, pharmacy and travel. During the second quarter of 2023, c hanges in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $937, 184 basis points, compared to the second quarter of 2022, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. T he volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 9%, positively impacting net sales by $565, 111 basis points. Changes in gasoline prices did not materially impact net sales for the current quarter. During the first half of 2023, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $2,471, 246 basis points, compared to the first half of 2022, attributable to our Canadian and Other International Operations. Higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $1,254, 125 basis points, compared to 2022, with a 9% increase in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 10%, positively impacting net sales by $1,215, 121 basis points. 21 Table of Contents Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 5% and 6% in the second quarter and first half of 2023 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and the average ticket, which includes the effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency. Membership Fees 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 12, 2023 February 13, 2022 February 12, 2023 February 13, 2022 Membership fees $ 1,027 $ 967 $ 2,027 $ 1,913 Membership fees increase 6 % 10 % 6 % 10 % Total paid members (000s) 68,100 63,400 — — Total cardholders (000s) 123,000 114,800 — — Membership fee revenue increased 6% in both the second quarter and first half of 2023, driven by sign-ups, upgrades to Executive Membership, and a higher renewal rate. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted membership fees by $20 and $52 in the second quarter and first half of 2023. At the end of the second quarter of 2023, our renewal rates were 92.6% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide. Renewal rates continue to benefit from more members auto renewing and increased penetration of Executive members, who on average renew at a higher rate. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Our membership counts include active memberships and memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. Gross Margin 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 12, 2023 February 13, 2022 February 12, 2023 February 13, 2022 Net sales $ 54,239 $ 50,937 $ 107,676 $ 100,354 Less merchandise costs 48,423 45,517 96,192 89,469 Gross margin $ 5,816 $ 5,420 $ 11,484 $ 10,885 Gross margin percentage 10.72 % 10.64 % 10.67 % 10.85 % Quarterly Results Total gross margin percentage increased eight basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 10.73%, an increase of nine basis points. This was driven primarily by a 14 basis-point increase due to a LIFO charge recorded in the second quarter of 2022. Warehouse ancillary and other business also positively impacted gross margin by three basis points, predominantly gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce and pharmacy. Core merchandise categories negatively impacted gross margin by six basis points, predominantly in non-foods and fresh foods, partially offset by foods and sundries. Gross margin was negatively impacted by two basis points due to increased 2% rewards. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $91, compared to the second quarter of 2022, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. The gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 26 basis points. The decrease was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. 22 Table of Contents Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased in our U.S. segment, largely due to the LIFO charge discussed above and an increase in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce. Gross margin percentage decreased in our Canadian and Other International segment due to decreases in core merchandise categories and increased 2% rewards, partially offset by warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Year-to-date Results Total gross margin percentage decreased 18 basis points compared to the first half of 2022. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 10.79%, a decrease of six basis points. This was primarily due to an 18 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories, predominantly in non-foods and fresh foods, partially offset by foods and sundries, and a nine basis-point charge primarily related to downsizing our charter shipping activities during the first quarter of 2023. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by three basis points due to increased 2% rewards. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses positively impacted gross margin by 16 basis points, predominantly gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce. A smaller LIFO charge in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022 positively contributed eight basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $244, compared to the first half of 2022, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. The gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 29 basis points. The decrease was primarily due to fresh foods and non-foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Segment gross margin percentage increased in our U.S. segment, due to warehouse ancillary and other businesses and a smaller LIFO charge, partially offset by the charge related to downsizing our charter shipping activities and decreases in certain core merchandise categories, non-foods and fresh foods, partially offset by foods and sundries. Gross margin decreased in our Canadian and Other International segment due to decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by warehouse ancillary and other businesses. All segments were negatively impacted by increased 2% rewards. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 12, 2023 February 13, 2022 February 12, 2023 February 13, 2022 SG&A expenses $ 4,940 $ 4,575 $ 9,857 $ 9,293 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 9.11 % 8.98 % 9.15 % 9.26 % Quarterly Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 13 basis points. The effect of gasoline price inflation had no impact on SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. The comparison to last year was negatively impacted by nine basis points in central operating costs partially attributable to a charge related to a tax audit covering multiple years. Warehouse operations and other businesses and stock compensation were both higher by two basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased SG&A expenses by approximately $75 compared to the second quarter of 2022. 23 Table of Contents Year-to-date Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 11 basis points. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was flat compared to the first half of 2022. The comparison to last year was favorably impacted by 12 basis points from a write-off of certain information technology assets in the prior year. Warehouse operations and other businesses were higher by six basis points, largely attributable to the wage increases we instituted in 2022. Central operating costs were also higher by six basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased SG&A expenses by approximately $196 compared to the first half of 2022. Interest Expense 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 12, 2023 February 13, 2022 February 12, 2023 February 13, 2022 Interest expense $ 34 $ 36 $ 68 $ 75 Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes and financing leases. The decrease in interest expense for the first half of 2023 was due to repayment of the 2.300% Senior Notes on December 1, 2021. Interest Income and Other, Net 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 12, 2023 February 13, 2022 February 12, 2023 February 13, 2022 Interest income $ 105 $ 6 $ 159 $ 15 Foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), net 3 12 (6) 38 Other, net 6 7 14 14 Interest income and other, net $ 114 $ 25 $ 167 $ 67 The increase in interest income in the second quarter and first half of 2023 was due to higher global interest rates.

See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Item 8, Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2022. Provision for Income Taxes 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 12, 2023 February 13, 2022 February 12, 2023 February 13, 2022 Provision for income taxes $ 517 $ 481 $ 923 $ 832 Effective tax rate 26.1 % 26.7 % 24.6 % 23.8 % The effective tax rate for the first half of 2023 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $57, primarily due to excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.1% for the first half of 2023. The effective tax rate for the first half of 2022 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $91, primarily due to excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.4% for the first half of 2022. 24 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 24 Weeks Ended February 12, 2023 February 13, 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,802 $ 3,659 Net cash used in investing activities (1,865) (1,393) Net cash used in financing activities (1,215) (1,667) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $13,705 and $11,049 at February 12, 2023, and August 28, 2022. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $2,083 and $2,010 at February 12, 2023, and August 28, 2022. These receivables generally settle within four days. Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. Construction and land purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to the development and opening of new and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months. Management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows with capacity under existing and available credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $5,802 in the first half of 2023, compared to $3,659 in the first half of 2022. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including inventory turnover, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,865 in the first half of 2023, compared to $1,393 in the first half of 2022, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. 25 Table of Contents Capital Expenditure Plans Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first half of 2023, we spent $1,947 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $3,800 to $4,200 during fiscal 2023. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 12 new warehouses, including two relocations, in the first half of 2023 and plan to open 15 additional new warehouses, including one relocation, in the remainder of fiscal 2023. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs and the economic environment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,215 in the first half of 2023, compared to $1,667 in the first half of 2022. Cash flow used in financing activities during the first half of 2023 was primarily related to the payment of dividends, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, and repurchases of common stock. In the first half of 2022, cash flow used in financing activities was primarily due to the repayment of our 2.300% Senior Notes. Dividends A quarterly cash dividend of $0.90 per share was declared on January 19, 2023, payable to shareholders of record on February 3, 2023, which was paid on February 17, 2023. Share Repurchase Program On January 19, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, which expires in January 2027. During the first half of 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 579,000 and 236,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $492.06 and $498.00, totaling approximately $285 and $118. These amounts may differ from the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,955 at the end of the second quarter. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At February 12, 2023, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,269. Our international operations maintain $781 of this capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $177 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities were $45 and $88 at the end of the second quarter of 2023 and at the end of fiscal 2022. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $231. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the second quarter of 2023 totaled $191, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. 26 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments.

count data) (unaudited) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At November 20, 2022, Costco operated 845 warehouses worldwide: 582 in the United States (U.S.) located in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 107 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 31 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 18 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 13 in Australia, four in Spain, two each in France and China, and one each in Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and a subsidiary in which it has a controlling interest. All material inter-company transactions among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2022. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2023 is a 53-week year ending on September 3, 2023. References to the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 20, 2022, and November 21, 2021. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 8 Table of Contents Reclassification Reclassifications were made to the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the first quarter of 2022 to conform with current year presentation. Leases The Company leases land, buildings, equipment, and other assets at warehouses, offices, or within the operations that support supply chain and distribution channels. The Company reviews lease right-of-use assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. The Company also occasionally revisits and modifies the terms of its leasing arrangements. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company recognized a charge of $ 93 , primarily related to the termination costs and impairment of certain leased assets associated with charter shipping activities. This charge is included in merchandise costs. Note 2—Investments The Company's investments were as follows: November 20, 2022: Cost Basis Unrealized Losses, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 570 $ ( 12 ) $ 558 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 259 — 259 Total short-term investments $ 829 $ ( 12 ) $ 817 August 28, 2022: Cost Basis Unrealized Losses, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 534 $ ( 5 ) $ 529 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 317 — 317 Total short-term investments $ 851 $ ( 5 ) $ 846 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the periods ended November 20, 2022, and August 28, 2022 .

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. The Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will monitor the matter for developments that will make the contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in an action commenced in July 2013 under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to employees who work at entrance and exit doors in California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2013-1-CV-248813; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees.

OVERVIEW The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), as well as our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements, and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 5, 2022. We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts. We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define 17 Table of Contents comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations); inflation and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in the first quarter of 2023 was impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, as well as passing cost increases on to our members. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline businesses. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline businesses. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, government actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business, domestically and internationally, generally has a lower gross margin percentage than our warehouse operations. The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to 18 Table of Contents which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction require maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's currency exchange rates. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's average price per gallon sold. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 20, 2022, and November 21, 2021. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Highlights for the first quarter of 2023 versus 2022 include: • Net sales increased 8% to $53,437, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 7% and sales at 22 net new warehouses opened since the end of the first quarter of 2022; • Membership fee revenue increased 6% to $1,000, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive Membership, and an increase in our renewal rate; • Gross margin percentage decreased 45 basis points, driven primarily by our core merchandise categories and a charge of $93, $0.15 per diluted share, predominantly related to downsizing our charter shipping activities. This was partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 35 basis points, primarily due to a write-off of information technology assets of $118, $0.20 per diluted share, recorded in the first quarter of 2022, and leveraging increased sales in the first quarter of 2023. • The provision for income taxes in the first quarter of 2023 was positively impacted by a benefit related to stock compensation of $53, $0.12 per diluted share, compared to $91, $0.21 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2022. • Net income was $1,364, $3.07 per diluted share, compared to $1,324, $2.98 per diluted share in 2022; and • On October 12, 2022, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.90 per share, which was paid on November 10, 2022. 19 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 12 Weeks Ended November 20, 2022 November 21, 2021 Net Sales $ 53,437 $ 49,417 Changes in net sales: U.S 11 % 16 % Canada 3 % 19 % Other International — % 17 % Total Company 8 % 17 % Changes in comparable sales: U.S 9 % 15 % Canada 2 % 17 % Other International (3) % 13 % Total Company 7 % 15 % E-commerce (4) % 14 % Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-currency and gasoline prices: U.S 7 % 10 % Canada 8 % 8 % Other International 9 % 11 % Total Company 7 % 10 % E-commerce (2) % 13% Net Sales Net sales increased $4,020 or 8% during the first quarter of 2023.

Gross Margin 12 Weeks Ended November 20, 2022 November 21, 2021 Net sales $ 53,437 $ 49,417 Less merchandise costs 47,769 43,952 Gross margin $ 5,668 $ 5,465 Gross margin percentage 10.61 % 11.06 % Total gross margin percentage decreased 45 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 10.85%, a decrease of 21 basis points. This was primarily due to a 31 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories, predominantly in non-foods and fresh foods, and an 18 basis-point charge, primarily related to downsizing our charter shipping activities. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by five basis points due to increased 2% rewards. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses positively impacted gross margin by 30 basis points, predominantly gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce. A smaller LIFO charge in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 positively contributed three basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $153, compared to the first quarter of 2022, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. The gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 31 basis points. The decrease was primarily due to fresh foods and non-foods, partially offset by foods and sundries. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. 21 Table of Contents Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased across all segments. All segments were negatively impacted by decreases in core merchandise categories as described above and increased 2% rewards, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin in our U.S. segment was also negatively impacted by the charge primarily related to the downsizing of our charter shipping activities, partially offset by a lower LIFO charge. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 12 Weeks Ended November 20, 2022 November 21, 2021 SG&A expenses $ 4,917 $ 4,718 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 9.20 % 9.55 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 35 basis points. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was 9.42%, a decrease of 13 basis points. The comparison to last year was favorably impacted by 24 basis points from a write-off of certain information technology assets in the prior year. Stock compensation was also lower by one basis point. Warehouse operations and other businesses were higher by nine basis points, largely attributable to the wage increases we instituted in 2022. Central operating costs were higher by three basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased SG&A expenses by approximately $121 compared to the first quarter of 2022. Interest Expense 12 Weeks Ended November 20, 2022 November 21, 2021 Interest expense $ 34 $ 39 Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes and financing leases. Interest expense decreased in the first quarter of 2023 due to repayment of the 2.300% Senior Notes on December 1, 2021. Interest Income and Other, Net 12 Weeks Ended November 20, 2022 November 21, 2021 Interest income $ 54 $ 8 Foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), net (9) 26 Other, net 8 8 Interest income and other, net $ 53 $ 42 The increase in interest income in the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to higher global interest rates. Foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), net include the mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts and the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations. See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Item 8, Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2022. 22 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes 12 Weeks Ended November 20, 2022 November 21, 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 406 $ 351 Effective tax rate 23.0 % 20.7 % The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $56, primarily attributable to $53 in excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.1% for the first quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $97, primarily attributable to $91 in excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.4% for the first quarter of 2022. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 12 Weeks Ended November 20, 2022 November 21, 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,610 $ 3,258 Net cash used in investing activities (1,057) (912) Net cash used in financing activities (863) (839) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $11,673 and $11,049 at November 20, 2022, and August 28, 2022. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $2,488 and $2,010 at November 20, 2022, and August 28, 2022. These receivables generally settle within four days. Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. Construction and land purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to the development and opening of new and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months. Management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows with capacity under existing and available credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,610 in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $3,258 in the first quarter of 2022. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is 23 Table of Contents impacted by several factors, including inventory turnover, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,057 in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $912 in the first quarter of 2022, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Expenditure Plans Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first quarter of 2023, we spent $1,057 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $3,800 to $4,000 during fiscal 2023. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened eight new warehouses, including one relocation, in the first quarter of 2023 and plan to open 19 additional new warehouses, including two relocations, in the remainder of fiscal 2023. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs and the economic environment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $863 in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $839 in the first quarter of 2022. Cash flow used in financing activities was primarily related to the payment of dividends, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, and repurchases of common stock. Dividends On October 12, 2022, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.90 per share, payable to shareholders of record on October 28, 2022, which was paid on November 10, 2022. Share Repurchase Program During the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 285,000 and 77,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $495.94 and $455.08, totaling approximately $141 and $35. These amounts may differ from the repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At November 20, 2022, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,244. Our international operations maintain $756 of this capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $171 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities were $37 and $88 at the end of the first quarter of 2023 and at the end of fiscal 2022. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $226. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the first quarter of 2023 totaled $187, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. 24 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments.

WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data) (unaudited) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. For the period ended May 8, 2022, Costco operated 829 warehouses worldwide: 573 in the United States (U.S.) located in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 105 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 30 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 16 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 13 in Australia, four in Spain, two each in France and China, and one in Iceland. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2022 is a 52-week year ending on August 28, 2022. References to the third quarter of 2022 and 2021 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended May 8, 2022 and May 9, 2021, respectively. References to the first thirty-six weeks of 2022 and 2021 relate to the 36 weeks ended May 8, 2022 and May 9, 2021, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 9 Table of Contents Property and Equipment, Net The Company capitalizes certain computer software and costs incurred in developing or obtaining software. The Company recognized a $ 118 write-off of certain information technology assets, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2022, in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigations arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. The Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in an action commenced in July 2013 under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to employees who work at entrance and exit doors in California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2013-1-CV-248813; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that depot employees in California did not receive suitable seating or reasonably comfortable workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. CIVDS 1908816; San Bernardino Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In October 2019, the parties settled for an immaterial amount the seating claims on a representative basis, which received court approval in February 2020. The parties settled the temperature claims for an immaterial amount in April 2022, and court approval was received in May 2022. 14 Table of Contents In March 2019, employees filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods and itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-03454; C.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2019, the court issued an order denying class certification. In January 2020, the plaintiffs dismissed their Labor Code claims without prejudice, and the court remanded the action to state court. Settlement for an immaterial amount was agreed upon in February 2021. Final court approval of the settlement was granted on May 3, 2022. In May 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 2:19-cv-01340; E.D. Cal.). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. In September 2021, the court granted Costco’s motion for partial summary judgment and denied class certification. In August 2019, the plaintiff filed a companion case in state court seeking penalties under PAGA. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. FCS053454; Sonoma County Superior Court). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The state court action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal action. In April 2020, an employee, alleging underpayment of sick pay, filed a class and representative action against the Company, alleging claims under California law for failure to pay all wages at termination and for Labor Code penalties under PAGA. Kristy v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 5:20-cv-04119; N.D. Cal.). The case was stayed due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy, and his individual claim was settled for an immaterial amount. The class and representative action claims were thereafter dismissed. In December 2020, a former employee filed suit against the Company asserting collective and class claims on behalf of non-exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York Labor Law for failure to pay for all hours worked, failure to pay certain non-exempt employees on a weekly basis, and failure to provide proper wage statements and notices. The plaintiff also asserted individual retaliation claims. Cappadora v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 1:20-cv-06067; E.D.N.Y.). An amended complaint was filed, and the Company denied the material allegations of the amended complaint. Based on an agreement in principle concerning settlement of the matter, involving a proposed payment by the Company of an immaterial amount, the federal action has been dismissed. In April 2022, Cappadora and a second plaintiff filed an action against the Company in New York state court asserting the same class claims asserted in the federal action under the New York Labor Law and seeking preliminary approval of the class settlement. Cappadora and Sancho v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Index No. 604757/2022; Nassau County Supreme Court). In August 2021, a former employee filed a similar suit, asserting class claims on behalf of certain non-exempt employees under New York Labor Law for failure to pay on a weekly basis. Umadat v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:21-cv-4814; E.D.N.Y.). The Company answered the complaint on October 21, 2021, denying the material allegations. In April 2022, a former employee filed a similar suit, asserting class claims on behalf of certain non-exempt employees under New York Labor Law, as well as under the Fair Labor Standards Act, for failure to pay on a weekly basis and failure to pay overtime. Burian v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:22-cv-02108; E.D.N.Y.). In February 2021, a former employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, reimbursement of expenses, payment of final wages to terminated employees, and for unfair business practices. Edwards v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 5:21-cv-00716: C.D. Cal.). In May 2021, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted with leave to amend. In June 2021, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which the Company moved to dismiss later that month. The court granted the motion in part in July 2021 with leave to amend. In August 2021, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint and filed a separate representative action under PAGA asserting the same Labor 15 Table of Contents Code claims and seeking civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The Company filed an answer to the second amended class action complaint, denying the material allegations. In July 2021, a former temporary staffing employee filed a class action against the Company and a staffing company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, the timeliness of wages and final wages, and for unfair business practices. Dimas v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. STK-CV-UOE-2021-0006024; San Joaquin Superior Court). The Company has moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual claims and to dismiss the class action complaint. On September 7, 2021, the same former employee filed a separate representative action under PAGA asserting the same Labor Code violations and seeking civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The case has been stayed pending the motion to compel in the related case. In September 2021, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding the alleged failure to provide sick pay, failure to timely pay wages due at separation from employment, and for violations of California's unfair competition law. De Benning v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 34-2021-00309030-CU-OE-GDS; Sacramento Superior Court). The Company answered the complaint in January 2022, denying its material allegations. In April 2022, a settlement for an immaterial amount was agreed upon, subject to court approval. In March 2022, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding the failure to: pay wages, provide meal and rest periods, provide accurate wage statements, timely pay final wages, and reimburse business expenses. Diaz v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 22STCV09513; Los Angeles Superior Court). The Court stayed the case, including the Company's filing of a responsive pleading, pending the initial status conference. In May 2022, an employee filed a PAGA-only representative action against the Company alleging claims under the California Labor Code regarding the payment of wages, meal and rest periods, the timeliness of wages and final wages, wage statements, accurate records and business expenses. Gonzalez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 22AHCV00255; Los Angeles Superior Court). Beginning in December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and a hospital in Texas, class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 43 states and American Samoa. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, Utah, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of the pending matters. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 16 Table of Contents Note 9—Segment Reporting The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Japan, U.K., Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which consider geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021, and Note 1 above. Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Effective for fiscal 2022, stock-based compensation was allocated to the segments in this reporting. This change reflected a decision to evaluate the financial performance of the segments inclusive of this expense. Operating income was restated in each of the segments for all prior periods to reflect this change. The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments: United States Operations Canadian Operations Other International Operations Total 12 Weeks Ended May 8, 2022 Total revenue $ 38,534 $ 7,268 $ 6,794 $ 52,596 Operating income 1,205 324 262 1,791 12 Weeks Ended May 9, 2021 Total revenue $ 32,759 $ 6,299 $ 6,219 $ 45,277 Operating income 1,135 260 268 1,663 36 Weeks Ended May 8, 2022 Total revenue $ 112,418 $ 21,406 $ 21,039 $ 154,863 Operating income 3,502 918 876 5,296 36 Weeks Ended May 9, 2021 Total revenue $ 96,178 $ 18,311 $ 18,765 $ 133,254 Operating income 2,898 733 802 4,433 52 Weeks Ended August 29, 2021 Total revenue $ 141,398 $ 27,298 $ 27,233 $ 195,929 Operating income 4,470 1,093 1,145 6,708 Disaggregated Revenue The following table summarizes net sales by merchandise category; sales from e-commerce websites and business centers have been allocated to the applicable merchandise categories: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 Foods and Sundries $ 19,594 $ 17,551 $ 58,646 $ 53,194 Non-Foods 13,810 12,899 43,077 39,006 Fresh Foods 6,813 6,296 20,211 18,413 Ancillary and Other Businesses 11,395 7,630 30,032 19,998 Total net sales $ 51,612 $ 44,376 $ 151,966 $ 130,611 17 Table of Contents Item 2—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, and warehouse count data) FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

OVERVIEW The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), as well as our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements, and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2021 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 6, 2021. We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts. 18 Table of Contents We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, the chartering of container vessels and leasing of containers as well as passing cost increases on to our members. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China, the United States and the United Kingdom, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they 19 Table of Contents relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations. The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction require maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the third quarter of 2022 and 2021 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended May 8, 2022, and May 9, 2021. References to the first thirty-six weeks of 2022 and 2021 relate to the 36 weeks ended May 8, 2022, and May 9, 2021. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Highlights for the third quarter of 2022 versus 2021 include: • Net sales increased 16% to $51,612, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 15% and sales at 20 net new warehouses opened since the end of the third quarter of 2021; • Membership fee revenue increased 9% to $984, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive Membership, and an increase in our renewal rate; • Gross margin percentage decreased 99 basis points, driven primarily by our core merchandise categories and a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 84 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales; 20 Table of Contents • We incurred a one-time $77 pretax charge, primarily related to granting our employees one additional day of vacation under the new employee agreement that was effective March 14, 2022; • Net income was $1,353, $3.04 per diluted share, compared to $1,220, $2.75 per diluted share in 2021; and • On April 13, 2022, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.90 per share, which was paid on May 13, 2022. COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our business in the third quarter of 2022, albeit to a lesser extent. COVID-related and other supply and logistics constraints have continued to adversely affect some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future. During the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of fiscal 2021, we paid $57 and $515 in incremental wages related to COVID-19, which ceased in February 2021. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 Net Sales $ 51,612 $ 44,376 $ 151,966 $ 130,611 Changes in net sales: U.S 18 % 19 % 17 % 16 % Canada 16 % 34 % 17 % 22 % Other International 9 % 27 % 12 % 25 % Total Company 16 % 22 % 16 % 18 % Changes in comparable sales: U.S 17 % 18 % 16 % 15 % Canada 15 % 32 % 16 % 20 % Other International 6 % 23 % 8 % 21 % Total Company 15 % 21 % 15 % 16 % Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-currency and gasoline prices: U.S 11 % 15 % 11 % 15 % Canada 13 % 17 % 11 % 15 % Other International 9 % 13 % 10 % 16 % Total Company 11 % 15 % 11 % 15 % Net Sales Net sales increased $7,236 or 16%, and $21,355 or 16% during the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2022. This improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 15% in both the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2022, and sales at the 20 net new warehouses opened since the end of the third quarter of 2021. While sales increased in all core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses, the rate of increase was strongest in our gasoline, business centers, and travel businesses. Sales continued to be impacted by inflation, higher than what we experienced in the comparable periods of 2021 and earlier this fiscal year. 21 Table of Contents During the third quarter of 2022, higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $2,270, 511 basis points, compared to 2021, with a 42% increase in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 24%, positively impacting net sales by $1,082, 244 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $476, 107 basis points, compared to the third quarter of 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International operations. During the first thirty-six weeks of 2022, higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $5,829, 446 basis points, compared to 2021, with a 44% increase in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 25%, positively impacting net sales by $2,701, 207 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $379, 29 basis points, compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International operations, partially offset by our Canadian operations. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 15% in both the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2022, and were positively impacted by increases in the average ticket and shopping frequency, which includes the effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency. E-commerce comparable sales increased 7% and 11% in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2022. Membership Fees 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 Membership fees $ 984 $ 901 $ 2,897 $ 2,643 Membership fees increase 9 % 11 % 10 % 9 % Total paid members (000s) 64,400 60,600 — — Total cardholders (000s) 116,600 109,800 — — Membership fee revenues increased 9% and 10% in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2022, driven by sign-ups and upgrades to Executive Membership. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, our member renewal rates were 92% in the U.S. and Canada and 90% worldwide. Renewal rates continue to benefit from more members auto renewing and increased penetration of executive members, who on average renew at a higher rate. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. 22 Table of Contents Gross Margin 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 Net sales $ 51,612 $ 44,376 $ 151,966 $ 130,611 Less merchandise costs 46,355 39,415 135,824 115,951 Gross margin $ 5,257 $ 4,961 $ 16,142 $ 14,660 Gross margin percentage 10.19 % 11.18 % 10.62 % 11.22 % Quarterly Results Total gross margin percentage decreased 99 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 10.65%, a decrease of 53 basis points. This was primarily due to a 46 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories, due to decreases in fresh foods and non-foods and 27 basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs. Gross margin was positively impacted by 18 basis points related to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly gasoline, and three basis points due to 2% rewards. Gross margin was negatively impacted by one basis point due to the net impact of a one-time charge related to granting our employees one additional day of vacation under the new employee agreement and the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19. We expect the LIFO charge in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 to be substantially higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $51, compared to the third quarter of 2021. The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 39 basis points. The decrease was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased across all segments. Our U.S. segment performed similarly to the results above. Gross margin percentage in our Canadian segment was negatively impacted due to decreases in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin percentage in our Other International segment was negatively impacted due to decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Our Other International segment was also negatively impacted due to increased 2% rewards. All our segments benefited from the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19. Year-to-date Results Total gross margin percentage decreased 60 basis points compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin was 11.05%, a decrease of 17 basis points. This was primarily due to a 38 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories, predominantly driven by decreases in fresh foods and foods and sundries, and 15 basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses positively impacted gross margin by 27 basis points, predominantly gasoline. Gross margin was positively impacted by nine basis points due to the net impact of ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19 and the negative impact of a one-time charge related to granting our employees one additional day of vacation under the new employee agreement. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $43, compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2021, attributable to our Other International operations, partially offset by our Canadian operations. 23 Table of Contents The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 28 basis points. The decrease was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods. The segment gross margin percentage decreased in our U.S. and Canadian segment. Gross margin decreased in core merchandise categories, partially offset by warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Our U.S. segment was also negatively impacted due to the LIFO charge. The gross margin percentage decreased in our Other International segment due to decreases in core merchandise categories and increased 2% rewards, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. All our segments benefited from the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 SG&A expenses $ 4,450 $ 4,199 $ 13,743 $ 12,870 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 8.62 % 9.46 % 9.04 % 9.85 % Quarterly Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 84 basis points. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation the decrease was 44 basis points. Warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by 35 basis points, largely attributable to leveraging increased sales. This includes the impact of the starting wage increase we instituted in October 2021, as well as eight weeks of the increased wages and benefits that were effective on March 14, 2022. Central operating costs were lower by 10 basis points, and stock compensation expense was lower by one basis point. SG&A was negatively impacted by two basis points due to the net impact of a one-time charge related to granting our employees one additional day of vacation under the new employee agreement and the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted SG&A expenses by approximately $39, compared to the third quarter of 2021. Year-to-date Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 81 basis points compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation the decrease was 45 basis points. Warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by 18 basis points, largely attributable to leveraging increased sales. This includes the impact of the starting wage increase we instituted in October 2021 as well as eight weeks of the increased wages and benefits that were effective on March 14, 2022. SG&A was positively impacted by a net 18 basis points due to ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19, a write-off of certain information technology assets and a one-time charge related to granting our employees one additional day of vacation under the new employee agreement. Central operating costs were lower by eight basis points, and stock compensation expense was lower by one basis point. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted SG&A expenses by approximately $37, compared to the third quarter of 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International operations. Interest Expense 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 Interest expense $ 35 $ 40 $ 110 $ 119 Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes. Interest expense decreased in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2022 due to early repayment of the 2.300% Senior Notes on December 1, 2021. 24 Table of Contents Interest Income and Other, Net 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 Interest income $ 6 $ 8 $ 21 $ 29 Foreign-currency transaction gains, net 56 6 94 13 Other, net 9 13 23 33 Interest income and other, net $ 71 $ 27 $ 138 $ 75 Foreign-currency transaction gains, net include the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations and mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts.

Provision for Income Taxes 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 455 $ 417 $ 1,287 $ 1,004 Effective tax rate 24.9 % 25.2 % 24.2 % 22.9 % The effective tax rate for the first thirty-six weeks of 2022 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $114, which were primarily related to the first quarter. This included $91 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.3% for the first thirty-six weeks of 2022. The effective tax rate for the first thirty-six weeks of 2021 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $157, which was primarily related to the first quarter. This included $75 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation, $70 related to the special cash dividend paid through the 401(k) plan, and $19 primarily related to a reduction in the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. Excluding net discrete tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.4% for the first thirty-six weeks of 2021. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 36 Weeks Ended May 8, 2022 May 9, 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,886 $ 6,018 Net cash used in investing activities (2,428) (2,380) Net cash used in financing activities (2,343) (5,769) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $11,831 and $12,175 at May 8, 2022, and August 29, 2021. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $2,152 and $1,816 at May 8, 2022, and August 29, 2021. These receivables generally settle within four days. Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. 25 Table of Contents Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. Construction and land purchase obligations primarily relate to the development and opening of new and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months. Management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows, with capacity under existing and available credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. Management also believes that our current and projected U.S. asset position is sufficient to meet U.S. liquidity and capital requirements. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $4,886 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2022, compared to $6,018 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2021. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times to our members, earlier than usual purchasing in anticipation of cost increases, payment terms with our suppliers, and the amount paid early to obtain discounts from our suppliers. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,428 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2022, compared to $2,380 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2021, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Expenditure Plans Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first thirty-six weeks of 2022, we spent $2,632 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $4,000 during fiscal year 2022. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 17 new warehouses, including three relocations, in the first thirty-six weeks of 2022 and plan to open 10 additional new warehouses in the remainder of fiscal 2022. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon changes in capital expenditure needs or the economic environment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $2,343 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2022, compared to $5,769 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2021. Cash flow used in financing activities was primarily related to repayments of our 2.300% Senior Notes, the payment of dividends, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, and repurchases of common stock. In the first thirty-six weeks of 2021, cash flow used in financing was primarily due to the payment of a special dividend. Dividends On April 13, 2022, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.90 per share payable to shareholders of record on April 29, 2022, which was paid on May 13, 2022. 26 Table of Contents Share Repurchase Program During the first thirty-six weeks of 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 490,000 and 1,040,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $523.61 and $353.87, totaling approximately $257 and $368. These amounts may differ from the repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At May 8, 2022, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,006. Our international operations maintain $522 of this capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $182 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities were immaterial at the end of the third quarter of 2022 and at the end of 2021. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $225. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the third quarter of 2022 totaled $198, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base these on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in that Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements There have been no material changes in recently issued or adopted accounting standards from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021. Item 3—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our direct exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates and interest rates. There have been no material changes to our market risks as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021. 27 Table of Contents Item 4—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of May 8, 2022 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the third quarter of 2022, we implemented a new financial planning, consolidation and reporting application, which required changes to certain business processes and controls in the internal control over financial reporting. There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1—Legal Proceedings See discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. For the period ended February 13, 2022, Costco operated 828 warehouses worldwide: 572 in the United States (U.S.) located in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 105 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 30 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 16 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 13 in Australia, four in Spain, two each in France and China, and one in Iceland. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2022 is a 52-week year ending on August 28, 2022. References to the second quarter of 2022 and 2021 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended February 13, 2022 and February 14, 2021, respectively. References to the first half of 2022 and 2021 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 13, 2022 and February 14, 2021, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 9 Table of Contents Property and Equipment, Net The Company capitalizes certain computer software and costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. The Company recognized a $ 118 write-off of certain information technology assets, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2022, in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the condensed consolidated statements of income. Reclassification Reclassifications were made to our second quarter and first half 2021 condensed consolidated statements of income to conform with current period presentation. Note 2—Investments The Company's investments were as follows: February 13, 2022: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 364 $ 1 $ 365 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 112 — 112 Total short-term investments $ 476 $ 1 $ 477 August 29, 2021: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 375 $ 6 $ 381 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 536 — 536 Total short-term investments $ 911 $ 6 $ 917 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the periods ended February 13, 2022, and August 29, 2021 . At those dates, there were no available-for-sale securities in a material continuous unrealized-loss position. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during the first half of 2022 or 2021. The maturities of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities at February 13, 2022, are as follows: Available-For-Sale Held-To-Maturity Cost Basis Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 247 $ 247 $ 112 Due after one year through five years 117 118 — Total $ 364 $ 365 $ 112 10 Table of Contents Note 3—Fair Value Measurement Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The table below presents information regarding financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the level within the fair value hierarchy reflecting the valuation techniques utilized.

There were no transfers between levels during the first half of 2022 or 2021. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. There were no fair value adjustments to these items during the first half of 2022 or 2021. Note 4—Debt The carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt consisted of the following: February 13, 2022 August 29, 2021 2.300 % Senior Notes due May 2022 $ — $ 800 2.750 % Senior Notes due May 2024 1,000 1,000 3.000 % Senior Notes due May 2027 1,000 1,000 1.375 % Senior Notes due June 2027 1,250 1,250 1.600 % Senior Notes due April 2030 1,750 1,750 1.750 % Senior Notes due April 2032 1,000 1,000 Other long-term debt 694 731 Total long-term debt 6,694 7,531 Less unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 36 40 Less current portion (1) — 799 Long-term debt, excluding current portion $ 6,658 $ 6,692 _______________ (1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs. 11 Table of Contents The fair value of the Senior Notes is estimated using Level 2 inputs.

The fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $ 6,492 and $ 7,692 at February 13, 2022, and August 29, 2021. On December 1, 2021, the Company repaid, prior to maturity, the 2.300 % Senior Notes at a redemption price plus accrued interest as specified in the Notes' agreement. Note 5—Equity Dividends The Company’s current quarterly dividend is $ 0.79 per share, compared to $ 0.70 in the second quarter of 2021. On January 20, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $ 0.79 per share, which was paid on February 18, 2022. Share Repurchase Program The Company's share repurchase program is conducted under a $ 4,000 authorization by the Board of Directors, which expires in April 2023. The remaining amount available under the approved plan was $ 3,132 at February 13, 2022. Share repurchase activity during the second quarter of 2022 and 2021 is summarized below: Shares Repurchased (000s) Average Price per Share Total Cost Second quarter of 2022 159 $ 518.73 $ 83 First half of 2022 236 $ 498.00 $ 118 Second quarter of 2021 308 $ 362.95 $ 112 First half of 2021 521 $ 361.52 $ 189 These amounts may differ from the repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at quarter end. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. 12 Table of Contents Note 6—Stock-Based Compensation The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares ( 10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum of 27,800,000 shares ( 15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes. Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity At February 13, 2022, 10,388,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards were outstanding: • 3,403,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment over specified periods and accelerate upon achievement of the long-service term; • 39,000 performance-based RSUs, granted to executive officers of the Company, for which the performance targets have been met. The awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time and upon achievement of the long-service term; and • 82,000 performance-based RSUs, granted to executive officers of the Company, subject to achievement of performance targets for fiscal 2022, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors after the end of the fiscal year. These awards are included in the table below. The Company recognized compensation expense for these awards in the second quarter of 2022, as it is currently deemed probable that the targets will be achieved. The following table summarizes RSU transactions during the first half of 2022: Number of Units (in 000s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at August 29, 2021 4,349 $ 257.88 Granted 1,679 476.06 Vested and delivered ( 2,438 ) 290.20 Forfeited ( 66 ) 320.88 Outstanding at February 13, 2022 3,524 $ 338.29 The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs unvested at February 13, 2022, was $ 985 , and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.8 years. Summary of Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 13, 2022 February 14, 2021 February 13, 2022 February 14, 2021 Stock-based compensation expense $ 128 $ 122 $ 516 $ 463 Less recognized income tax benefits 23 22 108 97 Stock-based compensation expense, net $ 105 $ 100 $ 408 $ 366 13 Table of Contents Note 7—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of basic and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000s): 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 13, 2022 February 14, 2021 February 13, 2022 February 14, 2021 Net income attributable to Costco $ 1,299 $ 951 $ 2,623 $ 2,117 Weighted average basic shares 443,623 443,134 443,500 443,043 RSUs 1,293 1,360 1,260 1,397 Weighted average diluted shares 444,916 444,494 444,760 444,440 Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigations arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. The Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in an action commenced in July 2013 under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to employees who work at entrance and exit doors in California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2013-1-CV-248813; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that depot employees in California did not receive suitable seating or reasonably comfortable workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. CIVDS 1908816; San Bernardino Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In October 2019, the parties reached an agreement to settle for an immaterial amount the seating claims on a representative basis, which received court approval in February 2020. The workplace temperature claims continue in litigation. In March 2019, employees filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods and itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez v. Costco 14 Table of Contents Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-03454; C.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2019, the court issued an order denying class certification. In January 2020, the plaintiffs dismissed their Labor Code claims without prejudice, and the court remanded the action to state court. The remand was appealed; the appeal is in abeyance due to a pending settlement for an immaterial amount that was agreed upon in February 2021. The Court preliminarily approved the settlement in October 2021, and the Court's final review is scheduled for May 2022. In May 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 2:19-cv-01340; E.D. Cal.). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. In September 2021 the court granted Costco’s motion for partial summary judgment and denied class certification. In August 2019, the plaintiff filed a companion case in state court seeking penalties under PAGA. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. FCS053454; Sonoma County Superior Court). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The state court action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal action. In April 2020, an employee, alleging underpayment of sick pay, filed a class and representative action against the Company, alleging claims under California law for failure to pay all wages at termination and for Labor Code penalties under PAGA. Kristy v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 5:20-cv-04119; N.D. Cal.). The case was stayed due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy, and his individual claim was settled for an immaterial amount. A request for dismissal of the class and representative action is pending. In December 2020, a former employee filed suit against the Company asserting collective and class claims on behalf of non-exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York Labor Law for failure to pay for all hours worked, failure to pay certain non-exempt employees on a weekly basis, and failure to provide proper wage statements and notices. The plaintiff also asserted individual retaliation claims. Cappadora v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 1:20-cv-06067; E.D.N.Y.). An amended complaint was filed, and the Company denied the material allegations of the amended complaint. Based on an agreement in principle concerning settlement of the matter, involving a proposed payment by the Company of an immaterial amount, the federal action has been dismissed. In August 2021, a former employee filed a similar suit, asserting class claims on behalf of certain non-exempt employees under New York Labor Law for failure to pay on a weekly basis. Umadat v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:21-cv-4814; E.D.N.Y.). The Company answered the complaint on October 21, 2021, denying the material allegations. In February 2021, a former employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, reimbursement of expenses, payment of final wages to terminated employees, and for unfair business practices. Edwards v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 5:21-cv-00716: C.D. Cal.). In May 2021, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted with leave to amend. In June 2021, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which the Company moved to dismiss later that month. The court granted the motion in part in July 2021 with leave to amend. In August 2021, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint and filed a separate representative action under PAGA asserting the same Labor Code claims and seeking civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The Company filed an answer to the second amended class action complaint, denying the material allegations. In July 2021, a former temporary staffing employee filed a class action against the Company and a staffing company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, the timeliness of wages and final wages, and for unfair business practices. Dimas v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. STK-CV-UOE-2021-0006024; San Joaquin Superior Court). The Company has moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual claims and to dismiss the class action complaint. On September 7, 2021, the same former employee filed a separate representative 15 Table of Contents action under PAGA asserting the same Labor Code violations and seeking civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The complaint has not yet been served. In September 2021, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding the alleged failure to provide sick pay, failure to timely pay wages due at separation from employment, and for violations of California's unfair competition law. De Benning v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 34-2021-00309030-CU-OE-GDS; Sacramento Superior Court). The Company answered the complaint in January 2022, denying its material allegations. Beginning in December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and a hospital in Texas, class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 43 states and American Samoa. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, Utah, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of the pending matters. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 16 Table of Contents Note 9—Segment Reporting The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Japan, U.K., Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which consider geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021, and Note 1 above. Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Effective for fiscal 2022, stock-based compensation was allocated to the segments in this reporting. This change reflected a decision to evaluate the financial performance of the segments inclusive of this expense. Operating income was restated in each of the segments for all prior periods to reflect this change. The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments: United States Operations Canadian Operations Other International Operations Total 12 Weeks Ended February 13, 2022 Total revenue $ 37,567 $ 7,017 $ 7,320 $ 51,904 Operating income 1,179 301 332 1,812 12 Weeks Ended February 14, 2021 Total revenue $ 32,127 $ 6,001 $ 6,641 $ 44,769 Operating income 826 226 288 1,340 24 Weeks Ended February 13, 2022 Total revenue $ 73,884 $ 14,138 $ 14,245 $ 102,267 Operating income 2,297 594 614 3,505 24 Weeks Ended February 14, 2021 Total revenue $ 63,419 $ 12,012 $ 12,546 $ 87,977 Operating income 1,763 473 534 2,770 52 Weeks Ended August 29, 2021 Total revenue $ 141,398 $ 27,298 $ 27,233 $ 195,929 Operating income 4,470 1,093 1,145 6,708 Disaggregated Revenue The following table summarizes net sales by merchandise category; sales from e-commerce websites and business centers have been allocated to the applicable merchandise categories: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 13, 2022 February 14, 2021 February 13, 2022 February 14, 2021 Foods and Sundries $ 19,489 $ 17,624 $ 39,052 $ 35,643 Non-Foods 15,105 13,723 29,267 26,107 Fresh Foods 6,959 6,254 13,398 12,117 Ancillary and Other Businesses 9,384 6,287 18,637 12,368 Total net sales $ 50,937 $ 43,888 $ 100,354 $ 86,235 17 Table of Contents Item 2—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, and warehouse count data) FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

OVERVIEW The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), as well as our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements, and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2021 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 6, 2021. We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts. 18 Table of Contents We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China, the United States and the United Kingdom, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Merchandise costs in the second quarter and first half of 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations. 19 Table of Contents The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction require maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the second quarter of 2022 and 2021 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended February 13, 2022, and February 14, 2021. References to the first half of 2022 and 2021 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 13, 2022, and February 14, 2021. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Highlights for the second quarter of 2022 versus 2021 include: • Net sales increased 16% to $50,937, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 14% and sales at 25 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of 2021; • Membership fee revenue increased 10% to $967, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive Membership, and an increase in our renewal rate; • Gross margin percentage decreased 32 basis points, driven primarily by our core merchandise categories, partially offset by our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, primarily gasoline; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 94 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales and ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19; • Net income was $1,299, $2.92 per diluted share, compared to $951, $2.14 per diluted share in 2021; • On January 20, 2022 our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.79 per share, which was paid on February 18, 2022; and • Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in mid-March we will be increasing various wages and benefits, consistent with the three-year cycle on which this has been done historically. Most 20 Table of Contents significant are increases of a minimum of fifty cents per hour for U.S. and Canada wage scales. Certain other bonuses and benefits will be increasing for many employees. The estimated incremental annualized pre-tax costs of these increases, after considering our normal annual increases is approximately $275. Further, an additional $85 will be recorded in the third fiscal quarter related to a one-time true-up to accrued benefits, related to these wage and benefit changes. COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our business in the second quarter of 2022, albeit to a lesser extent. COVID-related and other supply and logistics constraints have continued to adversely affect some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future. During the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2021, we paid $246 and $458 in incremental wages related to COVID-19, which ceased in February 2021. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 13, 2022 February 14, 2021 February 13, 2022 February 14, 2021 Net Sales $ 50,937 $ 43,888 $ 100,354 $ 86,235 Changes in net sales: U.S 17 % 13 % 17 % 14 % Canada 17 % 15 % 18 % 16 % Other International 10 % 25 % 14 % 24 % Total Company 16 % 15 % 16 % 16 % Changes in comparable sales: U.S 16 % 11 % 15 % 13 % Canada 16 % 13 % 17 % 15 % Other International 6 % 22 % 10 % 20 % Total Company 14 % 13 % 15 % 14 % Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-currency and gasoline prices: U.S 11 % 13 % 11 % 15 % Canada 12 % 11 % 10 % 14 % Other International 9 % 18 % 10 % 18 % Total Company 11 % 13 % 11 % 15 % Net Sales Net sales increased $7,049 or 16%, and $14,119 or 16% during the second quarter and first half of 2022. This improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 14% and 15% in the second quarter and first half of 2022, and sales at the 25 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of 2021. While sales in all core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses increased, the rate of increase was strongest in our gasoline, business centers, and travel businesses. Sales continued to be impacted by inflation, higher than what we experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. 21 Table of Contents During the second quarter of 2022, higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $1,713, or 390 basis points, compared to 2021, with a 44% increase in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 25%, positively impacting net sales by $814, or 185 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $281, or 64 basis points, compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International operations. During the first half of 2022, higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $3,559, or 413 basis points, compared to 2021, with a 46% increase in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 26%, positively impacting net sales by $1,620, or 188 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $101, or 12 basis points, compared to the first half of 2021, primarily attributable to our Canadian operations, partially offset by our Other International operations. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 14% and 15% in the second quarter and first half of 2022, and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and the average ticket, which includes the effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency. E-commerce comparable sales increased 13% in the second quarter and first half of 2022. Membership Fees 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 13, 2022 February 14, 2021 February 13, 2022 February 14, 2021 Membership fees $ 967 $ 881 $ 1,913 $ 1,742 Membership fees increase 10 % 8 % 10 % 8 % Total paid members (000s) 63,400 59,700 — — Total cardholders (000s) 114,800 108,300 — — Membership fee revenues increased 10% in both the second quarter and first half of 2022, driven by sign-ups and upgrades to Executive Membership. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, our member renewal rates were 92% in the U.S. and Canada and 90% worldwide. Renewal rates continue to benefit from more members auto renewing, and increased penetration of executive members, who on average renew at a higher rate. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. 22 Table of Contents Gross Margin 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 13, 2022 February 14, 2021 February 13, 2022 February 14, 2021 Net sales $ 50,937 $ 43,888 $ 100,354 $ 86,235 Less merchandise costs 45,517 39,078 89,469 76,536 Gross margin $ 5,420 $ 4,810 $ 10,885 $ 9,699 Gross margin percentage 10.64 % 10.96 % 10.85 % 11.25 % Quarterly Results The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 28 basis points. The decrease was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Total gross margin percentage decreased 32 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 11.01%, an increase of five basis points. This was primarily due to a 49 basis-point increase in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly gasoline. Gross margin was also positively impacted by 14 basis points due to decreased incremental wages related to COVID-19, which ended February 28, 2021. Gross margin was negatively impacted due to a 43 basis-point decrease in all core merchandise categories, predominantly fresh foods and foods and sundries, 14 basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs, and one basis-point due to increased 2% rewards. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $31, compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International operations. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased in our U.S. and Canadian segment, due to warehouse ancillary and other businesses and ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19, partially offset by core merchandise categories. Our U.S. segment was also negatively impacted due to the LIFO charge. Gross margin percentage decreased in our Other International segment due to decreases in core merchandise categories and increased 2% rewards, partially offset by warehouse ancillary and other businesses and ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19. Year-to-date Results The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 23 basis points. The decrease was primarily due to fresh foods, and foods and sundries, partially offset by non-foods. Total gross margin percentage decreased 40 basis points compared to the first half of 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was flat as compared to the first half of 2021. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly gasoline, increased 31 basis points. Gross margin was also positively impacted by 13 basis points due to ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19. Gross margin was negatively impacted due to a 34 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories, predominantly foods and sundries, and fresh foods. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by nine basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs and one basis-point due to increased 2% rewards. The segment gross margin percentage increased in our U.S. segment and performed similarly to the quarterly results above. Gross margin percentage decreased in our Canadian segment, primarily due to decreases in core merchandise categories partially offset by warehouse ancillary and other businesses. 23 Table of Contents Gross margin percentage decreased in our Other International segment due to decreases in core merchandise categories and increased 2% rewards, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. All our segments benefited from the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 13, 2022 February 14, 2021 February 13, 2022 February 14, 2021 SG&A expenses $ 4,575 $ 4,351 $ 9,293 $ 8,671 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 8.98 % 9.92 % 9.26 % 10.06 % Quarterly Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 94 basis points. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation the decrease was 63 basis points. Ceasing incremental COVID-19 wages reduced expenses by 42 basis points. Central operating costs were lower by 10 basis points and warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by nine basis points, largely attributable to leveraging increased sales. Stock compensation expense was lower by two basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted SG&A expenses by approximately $23, compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International operations. Year-to-date Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points compared to the first half of 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation the decrease was 46 basis points. SG&A expenses were positively impacted by a net 28 basis points due to the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19, partially offset by a write-off of certain information technology assets. Warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by 10 basis points, largely attributable to payroll and benefits, primarily due to leveraging increased sales. Central operating costs were lower by eight basis points. Stock compensation expense was lower by one basis point. Pre-opening expenses were higher by one basis point. The first half of fiscal 2022 includes the permanent $1 increase for hourly employees in our warehouses and distribution channels that began in March 2021, and beginning in October 2021, the additional starting wage increase from $16 and $16.50 to $17 and $18.

These receivables generally settle within four days. Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. 25 Table of Contents Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. Construction and land purchase obligations primarily relate to the development and opening of new and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months. Management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows with capacity under existing and available credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. Management also believes that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet U.S. liquidity and capital requirements. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3,659 in the first half of 2022, compared to $2,685 in the first half of 2021. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times to our members, payment terms with our suppliers, and the amount paid early to obtain discounts from our suppliers. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,393 in the first half of 2022, compared to $1,037 in the first half of 2021, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Expenditure Plans Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first half of 2022, we spent $1,778 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $4,000 during fiscal year 2022. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 14 new warehouses, including one relocation, in the first half of 2022 and plan to open 15 to 18 additional new warehouses, including up to three relocations, in the remainder of fiscal 2022. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon changes in capital expenditure needs or the economic environment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,667 in the first half of 2022, compared to $5,350 in the first half of 2021. Cash flow used in financing activities was primarily related to repayments of our 2.300% Senior Notes, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, the payment of dividends, and repurchases of common stock. In the first half of 2021, cash flow used in financing was primarily due to the payment of a special dividend. Dividends On January 20, 2022, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.79 per share payable to shareholders of record on February 4, 2022, which was paid on February 18, 2022. Share Repurchase Program During the first half of 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 236,000 and 521,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $498.00 and $361.52, totaling approximately $118 and $189. These 26 Table of Contents amounts may differ from the repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At February 13, 2022, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,034. Our international operations maintain $550 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $195 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities were immaterial at the end of the second quarter of 2022, and at the end of 2021. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $229. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the second quarter of 2022 totaled $201, most of which were standby letters of credit which do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base these on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in that Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements There have been no material changes in recently issued or adopted accounting standards from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021. Item 3—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our direct exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates and interest rates. There have been no material changes to our market risks as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021. 27 Table of Contents Item 4—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of February 13, 2022 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data) (unaudited) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. For the period ended November 21, 2021, Costco operated 823 warehouses worldwide: 571 in the United States (U.S.) located in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 105 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 30 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 16 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 13 in Australia, three in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France and China. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2022 is a 52-week year ending on August 28, 2022. References to the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 21, 2021, and November 22, 2020. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public and private sector policies and initiatives. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 8 Table of Contents Property and Equipment, Net The Company capitalizes certain computer software and costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. In the first quarter of 2022, the Company recognized a $ 118 write-off of certain information technology assets, which was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the condensed consolidated statements of income. Reclassification Reclassifications were made to our first quarter 2021 condensed consolidated statements of income to conform with current period presentation. Note 2—Investments The Company's investments were as follows: November 21, 2021: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 354 $ 5 $ 359 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 366 — 366 Total short-term investments $ 720 $ 5 $ 725 August 29, 2021: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 375 $ 6 $ 381 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 536 — 536 Total short-term investments $ 911 $ 6 $ 917 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the periods ended November 21, 2021, and August 29, 2021 . At those dates, there were no available-for-sale securities in a continuous unrealized-loss position. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during the first quarter of 2022 or 2021. The maturities of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities at November 21, 2021, are as follows: Available-For-Sale Held-To-Maturity Cost Basis Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 198 $ 199 $ 366 Due after one year through five years 156 160 — Total $ 354 $ 359 $ 366 9 Table of Contents Note 3—Fair Value Measurement Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The table below presents information regarding financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the level within the fair value hierarchy reflecting the valuation techniques utilized.

At November 21, 2021, and August 29, 2021, the Company did not hold any Level 1 or 3 financial assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between levels during the first quarter of 2022 or 2021. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. There were no fair value adjustments to these items during the first quarter of 2022 or 2021. Note 4—Debt The carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt consisted of the following: November 21, 2021 August 29, 2021 2.300% Senior Notes due May 2022 $ 800 $ 800 2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 1,000 1,000 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1,000 1,000 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1,250 1,250 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1,750 1,750 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 1,000 1,000 Other long-term debt 704 731 Total long-term debt 7,504 7,531 Less unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 38 40 Less current portion (1) 799 799 Long-term debt, excluding current portion $ 6,667 $ 6,692 _______________ (1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs. 10 Table of Contents The fair value of Senior Notes is estimated using Level 2 inputs. Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japan subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $ 7,541 and $ 7,692 at November 21, 2021, and August 29, 2021. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on December 1, 2021, the Company repaid, prior to maturity, the 2.300 % Senior Notes at a redemption price plus accrued interest as specified in the Notes' agreement. Note 5—Equity Dividends The Company’s current quarterly dividend is $ 0.79 per share, compared to $ 0.70 in the first quarter of 2021. On October 13, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $ 0.79 per share, which was paid on November 12, 2021. On December 11, 2020, an aggregate payment of approximately $ 4,430 was made in connection with the special cash dividend of $ 10.00 per share, declared on November 16, 2020. Stock Repurchase Programs The Company's stock repurchase program is conducted under a $ 4,000 authorization by the Board of Directors, which expires in April 2023. The remaining amount available for stock repurchases under the approved plan was $ 3,215 at November 21, 2021. Stock repurchase activity during the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 is summarized below: Shares Repurchased (000s) Average Price per Share Total Cost First quarter of 2022 77 $ 455.08 $ 35 First quarter of 2021 213 $ 359.45 $ 77 These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at quarter end. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. 11 Table of Contents Note 6—Stock-Based Compensation The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares ( 10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum of 27,800,000 shares ( 15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes. Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity At November 21, 2021, 10,334,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards were outstanding: • 3,463,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment over specified periods and accelerates upon achievement of the long-service term; • 39,000 performance-based RSUs, granted to executive officers of the Company, for which the performance targets have been met. The awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time; and • 82,000 performance-based RSUs, granted to executive officers of the Company, subject to achievement of performance targets for fiscal 2022, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors after the end of the fiscal year. These awards are not included in the table below or in the amount of unrecognized compensation cost. The following table summarizes RSU transactions during the first quarter of 2022: Number of Units (in 000s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at August 29, 2021 4,349 $ 257.88 Granted 1,597 474.74 Vested and delivered ( 2,432 ) 290.20 Forfeited ( 12 ) 298.67 Outstanding at November 21, 2021 3,502 $ 334.16 The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs at November 21, 2021, was $ 1,089 , and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.8 years. Summary of Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits: 12 Weeks Ended November 21, 2021 November 22, 2020 Stock-based compensation expense $ 388 $ 341 Less recognized income tax benefit 85 75 Stock-based compensation expense, net $ 303 $ 266 12 Table of Contents Note 7—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of basic and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000s): 12 Weeks Ended November 21, 2021 November 22, 2020 Net income attributable to Costco $ 1,324 $ 1,166 Weighted average basic shares 443,377 442,952 RSUs 1,227 1,434 Weighted average diluted shares 444,604 444,386 Anti-dilutive RSUs — 432 Anti-dilutive shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted shares and earnings per diluted share because their impact would increase earnings per diluted share. Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigations arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in an action commenced in August 2013 under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to employees who work at entrance and exit doors in California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. ( Case No. 2013-1-CV-248813; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that depot employees in California did not receive suitable seating or reasonably comfortable workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. CIVDS 1908816; San Bernardino Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In October 2019, the parties reached an agreement to settle for an immaterial amount the seating claims on a representative basis, which received court approval in February 2020. The workplace temperature claims continue in litigation. 13 Table of Contents In March 2019, employees filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods and itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-03454; C.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2019, the court issued an order denying class certification. In January 2020, the plaintiffs dismissed their Labor Code claims without prejudice, and the court remanded the action to state court. The remand was appealed; the appeal is in abeyance due to a pending settlement for an immaterial amount that was agreed upon in February 2021. The Court preliminarily approved the settlement in October 2021, and the Court's final review is scheduled for May 2022. In May 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 2:19-cv-01340; E.D. Cal.). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The Company has moved for partial summary judgement, and the parties have filed competing motions regarding class certification. In August 2019, the plaintiff filed a companion case in state court seeking penalties under PAGA. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. FCS053454; Sonoma County Superior Court). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The state court action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal action. In June 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods, itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Martinez v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 3:19-cv-05624-EMC; N.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In June 2021, the plaintiff agreed to dismiss his claims for failure to provide meal and rest breaks and to pay minimum wages. In July 2021, the parties reached an agreement settling for an immaterial amount the remaining claim and related derivative claims. In April 2020, an employee, alleging underpayment of sick pay, filed a class and representative action against the Company, alleging claims under California law for failure to pay all wages at termination and for Labor Code penalties under PAGA. Kristy v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 5:20-cv-04119; N.D. Cal.). The case was stayed due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy, and his individual claim was settled for an immaterial amount. A request for dismissal of the class and representative action is pending. In July 2020, an employee filed an action under PAGA on behalf of all California non-exempt employees alleging violations of California Labor Code provisions regarding meal and rest periods, minimum wage, overtime, wage statements, reimbursement of expenses, and payment of wages at termination. Schwab v. Costco Wholesale Corporation (Case No. 37-2020-00023551-CU-OE-CTL; San Diego County Superior Court). In August 2020, the Company filed a motion to strike portions of the complaint, which was denied, and an answer has been filed denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2020, a former employee filed suit against the Company asserting collective and class claims on behalf of non-exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York Labor Law for failure to pay for all hours worked on a weekly basis and failure to provide proper wage statements and notices. The plaintiff also asserts individual retaliation claims. Cappadora v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 1:20-cv-06067; E.D.N.Y.). An amended complaint was filed, and the Company has denied the material allegations of the amended complaint. In August 2021, a former employee filed a similar suit, asserting collective and class claims on behalf of non-exempt employees under the FLSA and New York law. Umadat v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:21-cv-4814; E.D.N.Y.). The Company answered the complaint on October 21, 2021, denying the material allegations. 14 Table of Contents In February 2021, a former employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, reimbursement of expenses, payment of final wages to terminated employees, and for unfair business practices. Edwards v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 5:21-cv-00716: C.D. Cal.). In May 2021, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted with leave to amend. In June 2021, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which the Company moved to dismiss later that month. The court granted the motion in part in July 2021 with leave to amend. In August 2021, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint and filed a separate representative action under PAGA asserting the same Labor Code claims and seeking civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The Company filed an answer to the second amended class action complaint, denying the material allegations. In July 2021, a former temporary staffing employee filed a class action against the Company and a staffing company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, the timeliness of wages and final wages, and for unfair business practices. Dimas v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. STK-CV-UOE-2021-0006024; San Joaquin Superior Court). The Company will move to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual claims and to dismiss the class action complaint. On September 7, 2021, the same former employee filed a separate representative action under PAGA asserting the same Labor Code violations and seeking civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The complaint has not yet been served. In September 2021, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding the alleged failure to provide sick pay, failure to timely pay wages due at separation from employment, and for violations of California's unfair competition law. De Benning v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 34-2021-00309030-CU-OE-GDS; Sacramento Superior Court). The Company has not yet responded to the complaint. Beginning in December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and a hospital in Texas, class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 43 states and American Samoa. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, Utah, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of the pending matters. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 15 Table of Contents Note 9—Segment Reporting The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Japan, U.K., Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which consider geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021, and Note 1 above. Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Effective for the 12 weeks ending November 21, 2021, stock-based compensation was allocated to the segments. This change reflected a decision to evaluate the financial performance of the Company's segments inclusive of this expense. Operating income was restated in each of the segments for all prior periods to reflect this change. The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments: United States Operations Canadian Operations Other International Operations Total 12 Weeks Ended November 21, 2021 Total revenue $ 36,317 $ 7,121 $ 6,925 $ 50,363 Operating income 1,118 293 282 1,693 12 Weeks Ended November 22, 2020 Total revenue $ 31,292 $ 6,011 $ 5,905 $ 43,208 Operating income 937 247 246 1,430 52 Weeks Ended August 29, 2021 Total revenue $ 141,398 $ 27,298 $ 27,233 $ 195,929 Operating income 4,470 1,093 1,145 6,708 Disaggregated Revenue The following table summarizes net sales by merchandise category; sales from e-commerce websites and business centers have been allocated to their respective merchandise categories: 12 Weeks Ended November 21, 2021 November 22, 2020 Foods and Sundries $ 19,563 $ 18,019 Non-Foods 14,162 12,384 Fresh Foods 6,439 5,863 Ancillary and Other Businesses 9,253 6,081 Total net sales $ 49,417 $ 42,347 16 Table of Contents Item 2—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, and warehouse count data) FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

OVERVIEW The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), as well as our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements, and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2021 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 6, 2021. We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts. 17 Table of Contents We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (includes e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China, the United States and the United Kingdom, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Merchandise costs were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations. 18 Table of Contents The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack an e-commerce business. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 21, 2021, and November 22, 2020. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Highlights for the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021 include: • Net sales increased 17% to $49,417, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 15% and sales at 20 net new warehouses opened since the end of the first quarter of 2021; • Membership fee revenue increased 10% to $946, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive Membership, and an increase in our renewal rate as more members have transitioned to auto renew; • Gross margin percentage decreased 49 basis points, driven primarily by our core merchandise categories; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 65 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales and ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19; • The provision for income taxes in the first quarter of 2022 was positively impacted by a benefit related to stock compensation of $91, $0.21 per diluted share, compared to $75, $0.17 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2021. The first quarter of 2021 was also positively impacted by a benefit of $70, $0.16 per diluted share, in connection with the portion of the special dividend paid to 401(k) participants; 19 Table of Contents • Net income was $1,324, $2.98 per diluted share, compared to $1,166, $2.62 per diluted share in 2021; and • A quarterly cash dividend of $0.79 per share was paid on November 12, 2021. COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic continues. COVID-related and other supply and logistics constraints have continued to adversely affect some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we paid $212 incremental wages related to COVID-19, which ceased in February 2021. Certain risks and uncertainties related to the pandemic and vaccine mandates are included in Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A) of this Form 10-Q and in Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 12 Weeks Ended November 21, 2021 November 22, 2020 Net Sales $ 49,417 $ 42,347 Changes in net sales: U.S 16 % 16 % Canada 19 % 18 % Other International 17 % 22 % Total Company 17 % 17 % Changes in comparable sales: U.S 15 % 15 % Canada 17 % 16 % Other International 13 % 19 % Total Company 15 % 15 % Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-currency and gasoline prices: U.S 10 % 17 % Canada 8 % 17 % Other International 11 % 18 % Total Company 10 % 17 % Net Sales Net sales increased $7,070 or 17% during the first quarter of 2022. This improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 15% and sales at the 20 net new warehouses opened since the end of the first quarter of 2021. While sales in all core merchandise categories increased, increases were strongest in non-foods, gasoline, and travel. Merchandise costs continued to be impacted by inflation, slightly higher than what we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $1,843, or 435 basis points, compared to 2021, with a 49% increase in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 26%, positively impacting net sales by $809, or 191 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $380, or 90 basis points, compared to the first quarter of 2021, primarily attributable to our Canadian operations. 20 Table of Contents Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 15% in the first quarter of 2022, and were positively impacted by increases in the average ticket and shopping frequency. There was an increase of 14% in e-commerce comparable sales in the first quarter of 2022. Membership Fees 12 Weeks Ended November 21, 2021 November 22, 2020 Membership fees $ 946 $ 861 Membership fees increase 10 % 7 % Total paid members (000s) 62,500 59,100 Total cardholders (000s) 113,100 107,100 Membership fee revenues increased 10%, driven by sign-ups and upgrades to Executive Membership. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, our member renewal rates were 92% in the U.S. and Canada and 89% worldwide. Renewal rates continue to benefit from more members auto renewing, as well as increased penetration of executive members, who on average renew at a higher rate. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. Gross Margin 12 Weeks Ended November 21, 2021 November 22, 2020 Net sales $ 49,417 $ 42,347 Less merchandise costs 43,952 37,458 Gross margin $ 5,465 $ 4,889 Gross margin percentage 11.06 % 11.55 % The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 18 basis points. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The decrease was primarily due to fresh foods and foods and sundries, partially offset by non-foods. Total gross margin percentage decreased 49 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 11.49%, a decrease of six basis points. This was primarily due to a 26 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories, predominantly foods and sundries and fresh foods. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by three basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs and one basis-point due to increased 2% rewards. Gross margin percentage was positively impacted by 12 basis points due to decreased incremental wages related to COVID-19, which ended on February 28, 2021. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses increased 12 basis points, primarily due to our gasoline business and certain other ancillary businesses. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased in our U.S. segment, due to warehouse ancillary and other businesses, partially offset by core 21 Table of Contents merchandise categories and the LIFO charge. Gross margin percentage decreased in our Canadian segment, primarily due to decreases in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin percentage decreased in our Other International segment due to decreases in core merchandise categories and increased 2% rewards. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 12 Weeks Ended November 21, 2021 November 22, 2020 SG&A expenses $ 4,718 $ 4,320 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 9.55 % 10.20 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 65 basis points. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was 9.92%, a decrease of 28 basis points. Warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by 11 basis points, largely attributable to payroll leveraging increased sales. Central operating costs were lower by six basis points. SG&A expenses were also lower by a net 13 basis points resulting from ceasing incremental COVID-19 wages, partially offset by a write-off of certain information technology assets. Stock compensation and pre-opening expenses were each higher by one basis-point. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted SG&A expenses by approximately $25, compared to the first quarter of 2021, primarily attributable to our Canadian operations. The first quarter of fiscal 2022 includes the permanent $1 increase for hourly employees in our warehouses and distribution channels that began in March 2021, and beginning in October 2021, the additional starting wage increase from $16 and $16.50 to $17 and $18. Interest Expense 12 Weeks Ended November 21, 2021 November 22, 2020 Interest expense $ 39 $ 39 Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes. Interest Income and Other, Net 12 Weeks Ended November 21, 2021 November 22, 2020 Interest income $ 8 $ 10 Foreign-currency transaction gains, net 26 8 Other, net 8 11 Interest income and other, net $ 42 $ 29 Foreign-currency transaction gains, net include the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations and mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts. See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Item 8, Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021. 22 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes 12 Weeks Ended November 21, 2021 November 22, 2020 Provision for income taxes $ 351 $ 239 Effective tax rate 20.7 % 16.8 % The effective tax rate was favorably impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $97. This was primarily attributable to $91 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.4%. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was favorably impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $135. This was primarily attributable to $75 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation and $70 related to the special cash dividend paid through the 401(k) plan. Excluding net discrete tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.3% for the first quarter of 2021. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 12 Weeks Ended November 21, 2021 November 22, 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,258 $ 2,647 Net cash used in investing activities (912) (682) Net cash used in financing activities (839) (700) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $13,476 and $12,175 at November 21, 2021, and August 29, 2021. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $2,245 and $1,816 at November 21, 2021, and August 29, 2021. These receivables generally settle within four days. Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. Construction and land purchase obligations primarily relate to the development and opening of new and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months. Management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows as well as capacity under existing and available credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. Management also believes that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet U.S. liquidity and capital requirements. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3,258 in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $2,647 in the first quarter of 2021. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts 23 Table of Contents payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the strategic forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times to our members, payment terms with our suppliers, and the amount of payables paid early to obtain discounts from our suppliers. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $912 in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $682 in the first quarter of 2021, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Expenditure Plans Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first quarter of 2022, we spent $1,055 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $4,000 during fiscal year 2022. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened nine new warehouses, including one relocation, in the first quarter of 2022 and plan to open 20 to 23 additional new warehouses, including up to four relocations, in the remainder of fiscal 2022. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon changes in capital expenditure needs or the economic environment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $839 in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $700 in the first quarter of 2021. Cash flow used in financing activities was primarily related to withholding taxes on stock-based awards, the payment of dividends, and repurchases of common stock. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on December 1, 2021, we repaid, prior to maturity, the 2.300% Senior Notes at a redemption price plus accrued interest as specified in the Notes' agreement. Dividends On October 13, 2021, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.79 per share payable to shareholders of record on October 29, 2021, which was paid on November 12, 2021. Stock Repurchase Program During the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 77,000 and 213,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $455.08 and $359.45, totaling approximately $35 and $77. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At November 21, 2021, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,046. Our international operations maintain $561 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $198 is guaranteed by the Company. There were no outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of the first quarter of 2022, and short-term borrowings were immaterial at the end of 2021. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $235. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the first quarter of 2022 totaled $200, most of which were standby letters of credit which do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally 24 Table of Contents intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base these on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in that Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements There have been no material changes in recently issued or adopted accounting standards from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021. Item 3—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our direct exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates and interest rates. There have been no material changes to our market risks as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021. Item 4—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 21, 2021 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1—Legal Proceedings See discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. Item 1A—Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as stated below. 25 Table of Contents Vaccine mandates and other governmental requirements related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations. Subsequent to our Annual report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 29, 2021, the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced a vaccine mandate, originally effective beginning January 4, 2022, which requires COVID-19 vaccinations or at least weekly COVID-19 testing for all United States employers with 100 or more employees. Whether and when the mandate will take effect depends on judicial challenges that are pending. This mandate, and similar mandates in place and potentially forthcoming at the state and local level, could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees, increase expenses, and pose operational issues with respect to testing requirements.

except share, per share, and warehouse count data) (unaudited) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. For the period ended May 9, 2021, Costco operated 809 warehouses worldwide: 559 in the United States (U.S.) located in 45 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 105 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 29 in Japan, 16 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 12 in Australia, three in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France and China. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2021 is a 52-week year ending on August 29, 2021. References to the third quarter of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended May 9, 2021, and May 10, 2020. References to the first thirty-six weeks of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 36 weeks ended May 9, 2021, and May 10, 2020. 9 Table of Contents Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public and private sector policies and initiatives. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 2—Acquisition of Innovel On March 17, 2020, the Company acquired Innovel Solutions for $ 999 , using existing cash and cash equivalents. Innovel (now known as Costco Wholesale Logistics or CWL) provides final-mile delivery, installation and white-glove capabilities for big and bulky products across the United States and Puerto Rico. Its financial results have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. As of May 9, 2021, the provisional period of the acquisition has ended, and the Company has completed the accounting for the acquisition. The net purchase price of $ 999 has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets of $ 294 and liabilities assumed of $ 235 , based on fair values on the acquisition date. The remaining unallocated net purchase price of $ 940 was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the acquisition's benefits to the Company, which include the ability to serve more members and improve delivery times, enabling growth in certain segments of our U.S. e-commerce operations. The Company assigned this goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes, to reporting units within the U.S. segment. Changes to the purchase price allocation originally recorded in the third quarter of 2020 were not material. Note 3—Investments The Company's investments were as follows: May 9, 2021: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 427 $ 8 $ 435 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 465 — 465 Total short-term investments $ 892 $ 8 $ 900 August 30, 2020: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 436 $ 12 $ 448 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 580 — 580 Total short-term investments $ 1,016 $ 12 $ 1,028 10 Table of Contents Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the periods ended May 9, 2021, and August 30, 2020 . At those dates, there were no available-for-sale securities in a continuous unrealized-loss position. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during the first thirty-six weeks of 2021 or 2020. The maturities of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities at May 9, 2021, are as follows: Available-For-Sale Held-To-Maturity Cost Basis Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 219 $ 220 $ 465 Due after one year through five years 208 215 — Total $ 427 $ 435 $ 465 Note 4—Fair Value Measurement Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The table below presents information regarding financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the level within the fair value hierarchy reflecting the valuation techniques utilized.

There were no transfers between levels during the first thirty-six weeks of 2021 or 2020. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. There were no fair value adjustments to these items during the first thirty-six weeks of 2021 or 2020. 11 Table of Contents Note 5—Debt The carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt consisted of the following: May 9, 2021 August 30, 2020 2.300% Senior Notes due May 2022 $ 800 $ 800 2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 1,000 1,000 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1,000 1,000 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1,250 1,250 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1,750 1,750 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 1,000 1,000 Other long-term debt 830 857 Total long-term debt 7,630 7,657 Less unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 43 48 Less current portion (1) 92 95 Long-term debt, excluding current portion $ 7,495 $ 7,514 _______________ (1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.

Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. 12 Table of Contents Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares ( 10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum of 27,800,000 shares ( 15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes. As required by the Company's Seventh Restated 2002 Incentive Plan and 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with a special cash dividend paid in the second quarter of 2021, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of 1.019 (rounded up to a whole share), representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $ 391.77 on November 30, 2020, which was the last trading day immediately prior to the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $ 384.50 on the ex-dividend date, December 1, 2020. The outstanding RSUs increased by approximately 94,000 . The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not change. As further required by the plans, the maximum number of shares issuable was proportionally adjusted, which resulted in an additional 222,000 RSU shares available to be granted. Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity At May 9, 2021, 11,981,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards were outstanding: • 4,242,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment over specified periods; • 29,000 performance-based RSUs, granted to executive officers of the Company, for which the performance targets have been met. The awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time; and • 102,000 performance-based RSUs, granted to executive officers of the Company, subject to achievement of performance targets for fiscal 2021, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors after the end of the fiscal year. These awards are included in the table below. The Company recognized compensation expense for these awards in the third quarter of 2021, as it is currently deemed probable that the targets will be achieved. The following table summarizes RSU transactions during the first thirty-six weeks of 2021: Number of Units (in 000s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at August 30, 2020 5,174 $ 207.55 Granted 1,982 369.15 Vested and delivered ( 2,760 ) 235.67 Forfeited ( 117 ) 251.89 Special cash dividend 94 N/A Outstanding at May 9, 2021 4,373 $ 257.87 The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs at May 9, 2021, was $ 852 , and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.7 years. 13 Table of Contents Summary of Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 Stock-based compensation expense $ 87 $ 88 $ 550 $ 508 Less recognized income tax benefit 18 18 115 105 Stock-based compensation expense, net $ 69 $ 70 $ 435 $ 403 Note 8—Taxes The Company's reported effective income tax rate for the first thirty-six weeks of 2021 was 26.4 %, excluding the impact of discrete net tax benefits. The provision for income taxes was favorably impacted by discrete tax items, including $ 75 related to the excess tax benefit on stock compensation, $ 70 related to the portion of the special cash dividend payable through our 401(k) plan and $ 19 primarily related to a reduction in the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. Other Taxes The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. The possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. Note 9—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of basic and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000s): 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 Net income attributable to Costco $ 1,220 $ 838 $ 3,337 $ 2,613 Weighted average basic shares 443,043 442,322 443,043 442,054 RSUs 1,084 1,533 1,293 1,700 Weighted average diluted shares 444,127 443,855 444,336 443,754 Anti-dilutive RSUs 1,046 — — — Anti-dilutive shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted shares and earnings per diluted share because their impact would increase earnings per diluted share. 14 Table of Contents Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in an action commenced in August 2013 under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to member service assistants who work at entrance and exit doors in the Company’s California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. ( Case No. 2013-1-CV-248813; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In January 2019, an employee brought similar claims for relief concerning Costco employees engaged at member services counters in California. Rodriguez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. RG19001310; Alameda Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. On February 4, 2021, the court finally approved a settlement, under which payment of an immaterial amount has been made. In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that depot employees in California did not receive suitable seating or appropriate workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. CIVDS 1908816; San Bernardino Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In October 2019, the parties reached an agreement to settle for an immaterial amount the seating claims on a representative basis, which received court approval in February 2020. The workplace temperature claims continue in litigation. In January 2019, a former seasonal employee filed a class action, alleging failure to provide California seasonal employees meal and rest breaks, proper wage statements, and appropriate wages. Jadan v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-CV-340438; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. In October 2019, the parties reached an agreement on a class settlement for an immaterial amount, which received court approval in January 2021. 15 Table of Contents In March 2019, employees filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods and itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-03454; C.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2019, the court issued an order denying class certification. In January 2020, the plaintiffs dismissed their Labor Code claims without prejudice, and the court remanded the action to state court. The remand is being appealed. In May 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 2:19-cv-01340; E.D. Cal.). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The Company has moved for partial summary judgment, and the parties have filed competing motions regarding class certification. In August 2019, Rough filed a companion case in state court seeking penalties under PAGA. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. FCS053454; Sonoma County Superior Court). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The state court action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal action. In June 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods, itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Martinez v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 3:19-cv-05624; N.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In April 2020, an employee, alleging underpayment of sick pay, filed a class and representative action against the Company, alleging claims under California law for failure to pay all wages at termination and for Labor Code penalties under PAGA. Kristy v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 5:20-cv-04119; N.D. Cal.). The Company filed a motion to dismiss as to the plaintiff's amended complaint, and the case has been stayed, due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy. In July 2020, an employee filed an action under PAGA on behalf of all California non-exempt employees alleging violations of California Labor Code provisions regarding meal and rest periods, minimum wage, overtime, wage statements, reimbursement of expenses, and payment of wages at termination. Schwab v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 37-2020-00023551-CU-OE-CTL; San Diego County Superior Court). In August 2020, the Company filed a motion to strike portions of the complaint, which was denied, and an answer has been filed denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2020, a former employee filed suit against the Company asserting collective and class claims on behalf of non-exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York Labor Law for failure to pay for all hours worked on a weekly basis and failure to provide proper wage statements and notices. The plaintiff also asserts individual retaliation claims. Cappadora v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 1:20-cv-06067; E.D.N.Y.). An amended complaint has been filed, and the Company has denied the material allegations of the amended complaint. In February 2021, a former employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, reimbursement of expenses, payment of final wages to terminated employees, and for unfair business practices. Edwards v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 5:21-cv-00716: C.D. Cal.) In May 2021, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate 16 Table of Contents Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are federal cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina and a third-party payor in Ohio, class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 42 states and American Samoa. Similar actions were commenced against the Company in state courts in Utah (2019) and Texas (2021). Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of these matters. The Company and its CEO and CFO are defendants in putative class actions brought on behalf of shareholders who acquired Company stock between June 6 and October 25, 2018. Johnson v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash.; filed Nov. 5, 2018); Chen v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash.; filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaints allege violations of the federal securities laws stemming from the Company’s disclosures concerning internal control over financial reporting. They seek unspecified damages, equitable relief, interest, and costs and attorneys’ fees. On January 30, 2019, an order was entered consolidating the actions, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on April 16, 2019. On November 26, 2019, the court entered an order dismissing the consolidated amended complaint and granting the plaintiffs leave to file a further amended complaint. A further amended complaint was filed on March 9, which the court dismissed with prejudice on August 19, 2020. An appeal in the Ninth Circuit is pending. Members of the Board of Directors, one other individual, and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to the internal controls and related disclosures identified in the putative class actions, alleging that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties. Wedekind v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (W.D. Wash.; filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement of compensation, corporate governance changes, and costs and attorneys' fees. Because the complaint is derivative in nature, it does not seek monetary damages from the Company, which is a nominal defendant. By agreement among the parties the action has been stayed pending further proceedings in the class action. Similar actions were filed in King County Superior Court on February 20, 2019, Elliott v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-04824-7), April 16, 2019, Brad Shuman, et ano. v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-10460-1), and June 12, 2019, Rahul Modi v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-15514-1). These actions have also been stayed. On June 23, 2020, a putative class action was filed against the Company, the “Board of Directors,” the “Costco Benefits Committee” and others under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Dustin S. Soulek v. Costco Wholesale, et al. , Case No. 20-cv-937. The class is alleged to be beneficiaries of the Costco 401(k) plan from June 23, 2014, and the claims are that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in the operation and oversight of the plan. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, damages, interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. On September 11, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and on September 21 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which the defendants have also moved to dismiss. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 17 Table of Contents Note 11—Segment Reporting The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which consider geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020, and Note 1 above. Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, are incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, but are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally come under the responsibility of the Company's U.S. management team. The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments: United States Operations Canadian Operations Other International Operations Total 12 Weeks Ended May 9, 2021 Total revenue $ 32,759 $ 6,299 $ 6,219 $ 45,277 Operating income 1,099 271 293 1,663 12 Weeks Ended May 10, 2020 Total revenue $ 27,626 $ 4,722 $ 4,918 $ 37,266 Operating income 853 129 197 1,179 36 Weeks Ended May 9, 2021 Total revenue $ 96,178 $ 18,311 $ 18,765 $ 133,254 Operating income 2,737 800 896 4,433 36 Weeks Ended May 10, 2020 Total revenue $ 83,214 $ 15,080 $ 15,084 $ 113,378 Operating income 2,309 559 638 3,506 52 Weeks Ended August 30, 2020 Total revenue $ 122,142 $ 22,434 $ 22,185 $ 166,761 Operating income 3,633 860 942 5,435 Disaggregated Revenue The following table summarizes net sales by merchandise category; sales from e-commerce are allocated to the relevant categories: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 Foods and sundries $ 17,551 $ 16,897 $ 53,194 $ 46,413 Hardlines 8,206 5,891 23,842 18,508 Fresh foods 6,296 5,587 18,413 15,242 Softlines 4,693 2,806 15,164 11,607 Ancillary and other 7,630 5,270 19,998 19,173 Total net sales $ 44,376 $ 36,451 $ 130,611 $ 110,943 18 Table of Contents Item 2—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, and warehouse count data) FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For these purposes, forward-looking statements are statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company expects or anticipates may occur in the future and may relate to such matters as net sales growth, changes in comparable sales, cannibalization of existing locations by new openings, price or fee changes, earnings performance, earnings per share, stock-based compensation expense, warehouse openings and closures, capital spending, the effect of adopting certain accounting standards, future financial reporting, financing, margins, return on invested capital, strategic direction, expense controls, membership renewal rates, shopping frequency, litigation, and the demand for our products and services. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified because they contain words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “likely,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, domestic and international economic conditions, including exchange rates, the effects of competition and regulation, uncertainties in the financial markets, consumer and small-business spending patterns and debt levels, breaches of security or privacy of member or business information, conditions affecting the acquisition, development, ownership or use of real estate, capital spending, actions of vendors, rising costs associated with employees (generally including health-care costs), energy and certain commodities, geopolitical conditions (including tariffs), the ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, COVID-19 related factors and challenges, including among others, the duration of the pandemic, the unknown long-term economic impacts, reduced member shopping due to illness, travel restrictions or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from discretionary or higher-priced products, reduced workforce due to illness, quarantine, or government mandates, temporary store closures due to reduced workforces or government mandates, supply-chain disruptions, or capacity constraints of third-party logistics suppliers and other risks identified from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. This management discussion should be read in conjunction with the management discussion included in our fiscal 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, previously filed with the SEC. OVERVIEW We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary and other businesses. We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced 19 Table of Contents by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China, the United States and the United Kingdom, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse business. The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. 20 Table of Contents Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack an e-commerce business. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the third quarter of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended May 9, 2021, and May 10, 2020. References to the first thirty-six weeks of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 36 weeks ended May 9, 2021, and May 10, 2020. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Highlights for the third quarter of 2021 as compared to the third quarter of 2020 include: • Net sales increased 22% to $44,376, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 21% and sales at 22 net new warehouses opened since the end of the third quarter of 2020; • Membership fee revenue increased 11% to $901, driven by signups at warehouses and online and upgrades to Executive Membership; • Gross margin percentage decreased 35 basis points, driven primarily by a shift in sales from our core merchandise categories to our ancillary and other businesses, partially offset by decreased incremental wages related to COVID-19, which ended on February 28, 2021; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 107 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales and decreased incremental wages related to COVID-19; • On April 14, 2021, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.79 per share, which was paid on May 14, 2021; and • Net income was $1,220, or $2.75 per diluted share, compared to $838, or $1.89 per diluted share in 2020. 21 Table of Contents COVID-19 During the third quarter of 2021, our sales mix began returning to pre-pandemic levels. This included strong sales in hardlines and softlines, gasoline, and in many of our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, certain of which experienced closures or restrictions in the third quarter of 2020. COVID-related supply and logistics constraints have adversely affected some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future. We paid $57 and $515 in incremental wages during the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2021, respectively, related to COVID-19. The incremental wage and benefit costs associated with COVID-19, which began on March 1, 2020 and ended on February 28, 2021, totaled approximately $825. Additionally, in certain areas where we do business in the United States, governments have mandated or are considering mandating extra pay for classes of employees that include our employees, which will result in higher costs. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 Net Sales $ 44,376 $ 36,451 $ 130,611 $ 110,943 Changes in net sales: U.S 19 % 8 % 16 % 8 % Canada 34 % (1) % 22 % 4 % Other International 27 % 11 % 25 % 10 % Total Company 22 % 7 % 18 % 8 % Changes in comparable sales: U.S 18 % 6 % 15 % 7 % Canada 32 % (3) % 20 % 3 % Other International 23 % 6 % 21 % 6 % Total Company 21 % 5 % 16 % 6 % Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-currency and gasoline prices: U.S 15 % 8 % 15 % 7 % Canada 17 % 3 % 15 % 5 % Other International 13 % 12 % 16 % 8 % Total Company 15 % 8 % 15 % 7 % Net Sales Net sales increased $7,925 or 22%, and $19,668 or 18% during the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2021, compared to the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2020. This improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 21% and 16% in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2021, and sales at the 22 net new warehouses opened since the end of the third quarter of 2020. While sales in all core merchandise categories increased, sales increases were particularly stronger in hardlines and softlines, and in many of our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly our gasoline business. 22 Table of Contents Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $1,032, or 283 basis points, compared to the third quarter of 2020, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. Changes in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales in the third quarter by $984, or 270 basis points, compared to 2020, due to a 32% increase in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold in the third quarter increased approximately 33%, positively impacting net sales by $820, or 225 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $1,551, or 140 basis points, compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2020, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. Changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales in the first thirty-six weeks of 2021 by $309, or 28 basis points, compared to 2020, due to a 2% decrease in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold in the first thirty-six weeks of 2021 increased approximately 2%, positively impacting net sales by $266, or 24 basis points. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 21% and 16% in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2021, and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket. There was an increase of 41% and 65% in e-commerce comparable sales in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2021. Certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation, slightly higher than what we have experienced in recent years. Membership Fees 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 Membership fees $ 901 $ 815 $ 2,643 $ 2,435 Membership fees as a percentage of net sales 2.03 % 2.24 % 2.02 % 2.20 % Total paid members (000s) 60,600 55,800 — — Total cardholders (000s) 109,800 101,800 — — Membership fees increased 11% and 9% in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2021. Excluding the positive impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, membership fees increased 8% and 7% for the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2021, driven by signups at warehouses and online and upgrades to Executive Membership. At the end of the third quarter of 2021, our member renewal rates were 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we standardized our membership count methodology globally to be consistent with the U.S. and Canada. If this standardization would have been done at the end of the third quarter of 2020, it would have resulted in an addition to the count of approximately 2.3 million total cardholders, of which 1.5 million were paid members. Membership fee income and the renewal rate calculations were not affected. 23 Table of Contents Gross Margin 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 Net sales $ 44,376 $ 36,451 $ 130,611 $ 110,943 Less merchandise costs 39,415 32,249 115,951 98,538 Gross margin $ 4,961 $ 4,202 $ 14,660 $ 12,405 Gross margin percentage 11.18 % 11.53 % 11.22 % 11.18 % Quarterly Results The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 27 basis points. This increase was predominantly in hardlines and softlines, partially offset by fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Total gross margin percentage decreased 35 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 11.43%, a decrease of 10 basis points. This was primarily due to a 29 basis point decrease in our core merchandise categories, driven by changes in sales mix. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by two basis points due to increased spending by our members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program. Gross margin percentage was positively impacted by nine basis points due to decreased incremental wages related to COVID-19, which ended on February 28, 2021, and five basis points related to a reserve for certain inventory in 2020. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses increased seven basis points, primarily due to improvement in certain ancillary businesses, which had been negatively impacted by COVID-19 related closures or restrictions in 2020, and e-commerce, partially offset by gasoline. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), performed similarly to the consolidated results above for our U.S. segment, except warehouse ancillary and other businesses decreased primarily due to our gasoline business. Gross margin percentage increased in our Canadian and Other International segments, primarily due to increases in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, core merchandise categories and decreased incremental wages related to COVID-19, partially offset by increased spending by members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program. Year-to-date Results The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales, increased 52 basis points. This increase was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods where gross margins increased primarily as a result of efficiencies from increased sales. Total gross margin percentage increased four basis points compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2020. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 11.20%, an increase of two basis points. This was primarily due to an increase of 31 basis points in our core merchandise categories, predominantly fresh foods and hardlines, and two basis points due to a reserve for certain inventory in 2020. These increases were partially offset by a 22 basis point decrease in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, certain of which were negatively impacted by lower sales due to COVID-19, predominantly our gasoline and travel businesses. The decreases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses were partially offset by e-commerce. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by incremental wages related to COVID-19 of six basis points and increased spending by members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program of three basis points. 24 Table of Contents Gross margin percentage decreased in our U.S. segment primarily due to warehouse ancillary and other businesses and incremental wages related to COVID-19, partially offset by increases in our core merchandise categories. Our Canadian and Other International segments increased primarily due to certain of our core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses. These increases were partially offset by the incremental wages and increased spending by executive members discussed above. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 SG&A expenses $ 4,189 $ 3,830 $ 12,829 $ 11,305 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 9.44 % 10.51 % 9.82 % 10.19 % Quarterly Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 107 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2020. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was 9.65%, a decrease of 86 basis points compared to the prior year. SG&A expenses were positively impacted by 56 basis points due to decreased incremental wages related to COVID-19, which ended on February 28, 2021, and sanitation costs. SG&A expenses were also positively impacted by 20 basis points in our warehouse operations and other businesses, largely attributable to payroll, primarily due to leveraging increased sales. SG&A expenses benefited five basis points from costs associated with the acquisition of Innovel in the third quarter of 2020, four basis points related to stock compensation expense, and one basis point related to central operating costs. Effective March 1, 2021, we implemented permanent wage increases for hourly and most salaried warehouse employees. This increase was effective for 10 of the 12 weeks within the third quarter of 2021. The estimated annualized pre-tax cost of these permanent wage increases is approximately $400. Year-to-date Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 37 basis points compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2020. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation was 9.80%, a decrease of 39 basis points compared to the prior year. Warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by 38 basis points, largely attributable to payroll, primarily due to leveraging increased sales. Stock compensation expense was lower by four basis points and central operating costs were lower by three basis points. SG&A expenses also benefited two basis points from the Innovel acquisition costs discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of eight basis points due to incremental wages related to COVID-19. 25 Table of Contents Preopening Expense 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 Preopening expenses $ 10 $ 8 $ 41 $ 29 Warehouse openings, including relocations United States 1 1 8 4 Canada 3 — 5 1 Other International 2 1 3 1 Total warehouse openings, including relocations 6 2 16 6 Preopening expenses include startup costs related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the openings relative to our quarter-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market. For the remainder of fiscal 2021, we expect to open seven warehouses. Interest Expense 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 Interest expense $ 40 $ 37 $ 119 $ 109 Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes.

Foreign-currency transaction gains, net include the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations and mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts. See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Item 8, Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020. 26 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 Provision for income taxes $ 417 $ 311 $ 1,004 $ 843 Effective tax rate 25.2 % 26.7 % 22.9 % 24.1 % The effective tax rate for the first thirty-six weeks of 2021 was favorably impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $157, which primarily related to the first quarter. This included $75 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation, $70 related to the portion of the special cash dividend payable through our 401(k) plan and $19 primarily related to a reduction in the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for the first thirty-six weeks of 2020 was favorably impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $68, primarily related to excess tax benefits from stock compensation. Excluding the discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.4% and 26.1% for the first thirty-six weeks of 2021 and 2020. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 36 Weeks Ended May 9, 2021 May 10, 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 6,018 $ 4,619 Net cash used in investing activities (2,380) (2,950) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (5,769) 771 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $11,126 and $13,305 at May 9, 2021, and August 30, 2020. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $1,896 and $1,636 at May 9, 2021, and August 30, 2020. These receivables generally settle within four days. Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $6,018 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2021, compared to $4,619 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2020. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the strategic forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times to our members, payment terms with our suppliers, and the amount of payables paid early to obtain discounts from our suppliers. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,380 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2021, compared to $2,950 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2020, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. In the third quarter of 2021, we acquired a distribution facility for $345 to support our logistics and delivery activities. In the third quarter of 2020, we acquired Innovel (Costco Wholesale Logistics). See N ote 2 in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. 27 Table of Contents Capital Expenditure Plans Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first thirty-six weeks of 2021, we spent $2,494 on capital expenditures. While COVID-19 has delayed certain construction projects, it is our current intention to spend between $3,300 and $3,500 during fiscal 2021. This increased from the second quarter of 2021 as a result of the distribution facility acquisition discussed above. We opened 16 new warehouses, including two relocations, in the first thirty-six weeks of 2021 and plan to open seven additional new warehouses in the remainder of fiscal 2021. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized; plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $5,769 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2021, compared to net cash provided of $771 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2020. Cash flow used in financing activities was primarily related to the payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, and withholding taxes on stock-based awards. During the first thirty-six weeks of 2020, we issued $4,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and we also repaid $1,700 of Senior Notes. Dividends On April 14, 2021, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.79 per share payable to shareholders of record on April 30, 2021, which was paid on May 14, 2021. Stock Repurchase Program During the first thirty-six weeks of 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 1,040,000 and 368,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $353.87 and $298.53, totaling approximately $368 and $110. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At May 9, 2021, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,059. Our international operations maintain $583 of the borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $206 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities at the end of the third quarter of 2021 were immaterial, and there were none outstanding at the end of 2020. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $213. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the third quarter of 2021 totaled $181, most of which were standby letters of credit which do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. 28 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations As of the date of this Report, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since the end of our last fiscal year. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments.

share, and warehouse count data) (unaudited) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. For the period ended February 14, 2021, Costco operated 803 warehouses worldwide: 558 in the United States (U.S.) located in 45 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 102 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 27 in Japan, 16 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 12 in Australia, three in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France and China. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2021 is a 52-week year ending on August 29, 2021. References to the second quarter of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended February 14, 2021, and February 16, 2020, respectively. References to the first half of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 14, 2021, and February 16, 2020, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from the novel 9 Table of Contents coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public and private sector policies and initiatives. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 2—Acquisition of Innovel On March 17, 2020, the Company acquired Innovel Solutions for $ 998 , using existing cash and cash equivalents. Innovel (now known as Costco Wholesale Logistics or CWL) provides final-mile delivery, installation and white-glove capabilities for big and bulky products across the United States and Puerto Rico. Its financial results have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. At February 14, 2021, the initial accounting for the acquisition was incomplete, pending determination of the final purchase price, working capital adjustments, the fair value of operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and other assumed obligations. The net purchase price of $ 998 was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets of $ 286 and liabilities assumed of $ 237 , based on their preliminary fair values on the acquisition date. The remaining unallocated net purchase price of $ 949 was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the acquisition's benefits to the Company, which include the ability to serve more members and improve delivery times, enabling growth in certain segments of our U.S. e-commerce operations. The Company assigned this goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes, to reporting units within the U.S. segment. The changes to the purchase price allocation originally recorded in the third quarter of 2020 were not material. The provisional period ends and the final accounting will be complete in the third quarter of 2021. Note 3—Investments The Company's investments were as follows: February 14, 2021: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 452 $ 9 $ 461 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 156 — 156 Total short-term investments $ 608 $ 9 $ 617 August 30, 2020: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 436 $ 12 $ 448 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 580 — 580 Total short-term investments $ 1,016 $ 12 $ 1,028 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the periods ended February 14, 2021, and August 30, 2020 . At those dates, there were no available-for-sale securities in a continuous unrealized-loss position. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during the first half of 2021 or 2020. 10 Table of Contents The maturities of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities at February 14, 2021, are as follows: Available-For-Sale Held-To-Maturity Cost Basis Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 206 $ 207 $ 156 Due after one year through five years 246 254 — Total $ 452 $ 461 $ 156 Note 4—Fair Value Measurement Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The table below presents information regarding financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the level within the fair value hierarchy reflecting the valuation techniques utilized. Level 2 February 14, 2021 August 30, 2020 Investment in government and agency securities (1) $ 463 $ 508 Forward foreign-exchange contracts, in asset position (2) 4 1 Forward foreign-exchange contracts, in (liability) position (2) ( 22 ) ( 21 ) Total $ 445 $ 488 _______________ (1) At February 14, 2021, $ 2 cash and cash equivalents and $ 461 short-term investments are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. At August 30, 2020, $ 60 cash and cash equivalents and $ 448 short-term investments are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. (2) The asset and liability values are included in other current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. At February 14, 2021, and August 30, 2020, the Company did not hold any Level 1 or 3 financial assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between levels during the first half of 2021 or 2020. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. There were no fair value adjustments to these items during the first half of 2021 or 2020. 11 Table of Contents Note 5—Debt The carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt consisted of the following: February 14, 2021 August 30, 2020 2.300% Senior Notes due May 2022 $ 800 $ 800 2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 1,000 1,000 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1,000 1,000 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1,250 1,250 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1,750 1,750 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 1,000 1,000 Other long-term debt 861 857 Total long-term debt 7,661 7,657 Less unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 44 48 Less current portion (1) 95 95 Long-term debt, excluding current portion $ 7,522 $ 7,514 _______________ (1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs. The fair value of Senior Notes is estimated using Level 2 inputs. Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japan subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $ 7,895 and $ 7,987 at February 14, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively. Note 6—Equity Dividends The Company’s current quarterly dividend is $ 0.70 per share, compared to $ 0.65 in the second quarter of 2020. On January 21, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $ 0.70 per share, which was paid on February 19, 2021. On December 11, 2020, an aggregate payment of approximately $ 4,430 was made in connection with the special cash dividend of $ 10.00 per share, declared on November 16, 2020. Stock Repurchase Programs Stock repurchase activity during the second quarter and first half of 2021 and 2020 is summarized below: Shares Repurchased (000s) Average Price per Share Total Cost Second quarter of 2021 308 $ 362.95 $ 112 First half of 2021 521 $ 361.52 $ 189 Second quarter of 2020 162 $ 301.50 $ 49 First half of 2020 262 $ 299.40 $ 79 These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. The remaining amount available for stock repurchases under the approved plan was $ 3,556 at February 14, 2021. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. 12 Table of Contents Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares ( 10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum of 27,800,000 shares ( 15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes. As required by the Company's Seventh Restated 2002 Incentive Plan and 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2021 special cash dividend the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of 1.019 (rounded up to a whole share), representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $ 391.77 on November 30, 2020, which was the last trading day immediately prior to the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $ 384.50 on the ex-dividend date, December 1, 2020. The outstanding RSUs increased by approximately 94,000 . The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not change. As further required by the Seventh Restated 2002 Incentive Plan and the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under each plan was proportionally adjusted, which resulted in an additional 222,000 RSU shares available to be granted. Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity At February 14, 2021, 11,946,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards were outstanding: • 4,285,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment over specified periods; • 29,000 performance-based RSUs, granted to executive officers of the Company, for which the performance targets have been met. The awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time; and • 102,000 performance-based RSUs, granted to executive officers of the Company, subject to achievement of performance targets for fiscal 2021, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors after the end of the fiscal year. These awards are included in the table below. The Company recognized compensation expense for these awards in the second quarter of 2021, as it is currently deemed probable that the targets will be achieved. The following table summarizes RSU transactions during the first half of 2021: Number of Units (in 000s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at August 30, 2020 5,174 $ 207.55 Granted 1,982 369.15 Vested and delivered ( 2,752 ) 235.72 Forfeited ( 82 ) 250.66 Special cash dividend 94 N/A Outstanding at February 14, 2021 4,416 $ 257.77 The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs at February 14, 2021, was $ 951 , and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.7 years. 13 Table of Contents Summary of Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 14, 2021 February 16, 2020 February 14, 2021 February 16, 2020 Stock-based compensation expense $ 122 $ 118 $ 463 $ 419 Less recognized income tax benefit 22 21 97 87 Stock-based compensation expense, net $ 100 $ 97 $ 366 $ 332 Note 8—Taxes Other Taxes The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. The possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. Note 9—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of basic and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000s): 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 14, 2021 February 16, 2020 February 14, 2021 February 16, 2020 Net income attributable to Costco $ 951 $ 931 $ 2,117 $ 1,775 Weighted average basic shares 443,134 442,021 443,043 441,920 RSUs 1,360 1,706 1,397 1,784 Weighted average diluted shares 444,494 443,727 444,440 443,704 Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or 14 Table of Contents unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in an action under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to member service assistants who act as greeters in the Company’s California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. ( Case No. 5:13-CV-03598; N.D. Cal.; filed July 1, 2013). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. The action has been remanded to state court. In January 2019, an employee brought similar claims for relief concerning Costco employees engaged at member services counters in California. Rodriguez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. RG19001310; Alameda Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that depot employees in California did not receive suitable seating or appropriate workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Dec. 6, 2018 Notice to California Labor and Workforce Development Agency). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In October 2019, the parties reached an agreement to settle the seating claims on a representative basis, which received court approval in February 2020. In January 2019, a former seasonal employee filed a class action, alleging failure to provide California seasonal employees meal and rest breaks, proper wage statements, and appropriate wages. Jadan v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-CV-340438; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. In October 2019, the parties reached an agreement on a class settlement, which received court approval in January 2021. In March 2019, employees filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods and itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-03454; C.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2019, the court issued an order denying class certification. In January 2020, the plaintiffs dismissed their Labor Code claims without prejudice, and the court remanded the action to state court. The remand is being appealed. In May 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 2:19-cv-01340; E.D. Cal.). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The Company has moved for partial summary judgment, and the parties have filed competing motions regarding class certification. In August 2019, Rough filed a companion case in state court seeking penalties under PAGA. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. FCS053454; Sonoma County Superior Court). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The state court action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal action. 15 Table of Contents In June 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods, itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Martinez v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 3:19-cv-05624; N.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In April 2020, an employee, alleging underpayment of sick pay, filed a class and representative action against the Company, alleging claims under California law for failure to pay all wages at termination and for Labor Code penalties under PAGA. Kristy v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 5:20-cv-04119; N.D. Cal.). The Company filed a motion to dismiss as to the plaintiff's amended complaint, and the case has been stayed due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy. In July 2020, an employee filed an action under PAGA on behalf of all California non-exempt employees alleging violations of California Labor Code provisions regarding meal and rest periods, minimum wage, overtime, wage statements, reimbursement of expenses, and payment of wages at termination. Schwab v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 37-2020-00023551-CU-OE-CTL; San Diego County Superior Court). In August 2020, the Company filed a motion to strike portions of the complaint. In December 2020, a former employee filed suit against the Company asserting collective and class claims on behalf of non-exempt employees under the FLSA and New York Labor Law for failure to pay for all hours worked on a weekly basis and failure to provide proper wage statements and notices. The plaintiff also asserts individual retaliation claims. Cappadora v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 1:20-cv-06067; E.D.N.Y.). The Company has not yet responded to the complaint. In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are federal cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina and a third-party payor in Ohio, class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 41 states and American Samoa. In 2019, similar actions were commenced against the Company in state court in Utah. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of these matters. The Company and its CEO and CFO are defendants in putative class actions brought on behalf of shareholders who acquired Company stock between June 6 and October 25, 2018. Johnson v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash.; filed Nov. 5, 2018); Chen v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash.; filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaints allege violations of the federal securities laws stemming from the Company’s disclosures concerning internal control over financial reporting. They seek unspecified damages, equitable relief, interest, and costs and attorneys’ fees. On January 30, 2019, an order was entered consolidating the actions, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on April 16, 2019. On November 26, 2019, the court entered an order dismissing the consolidated amended complaint and granting the plaintiffs leave to file a further amended complaint. A further amended complaint was filed on March 9, which the court dismissed with prejudice on August 19, 2020. An appeal in the Ninth Circuit is pending. 16 Table of Contents Members of the Board of Directors, one other individual, and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to the internal controls and related disclosures identified in the putative class actions, alleging that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties. Wedekind v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (W.D. Wash.; filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement of compensation, corporate governance changes, and costs and attorneys' fees. Because the complaint is derivative in nature, it does not seek monetary damages from the Company, which is a nominal defendant. By agreement among the parties the action has been stayed pending further proceedings in the class action. Similar actions were filed in King County Superior Court on February 20, 2019, Elliott v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-04824-7), April 16, 2019, Brad Shuman, et ano. v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-10460-1), and June 12, 2019, Rahul Modi v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-15514-1). These actions have also been stayed. On June 23, 2020, a putative class action was filed against the Company, the “Board of Directors,” the “Costco Benefits Committee” and others under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Dustin S. Soulek v. Costco Wholesale, et al. , Case No. 20-cv-937. The class is alleged to be beneficiaries of the Costco 401(k) plan from June 23, 2014, and the claims are that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in the operation and oversight of the plan. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, damages, interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. On September 11, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and on September 21 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which the defendants have also moved to dismiss. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 17 Table of Contents Note 11—Segment Reporting The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which consider geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020, and Note 1 above. Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, are incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, but are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally come under the responsibility of the Company's U.S. management team. The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments: United States Operations Canadian Operations Other International Operations Total 12 Weeks Ended February 14, 2021 Total revenue $ 32,127 $ 6,001 $ 6,641 $ 44,769 Operating income 790 236 314 1,340 12 Weeks Ended February 16, 2020 Total revenue $ 28,523 $ 5,231 $ 5,318 $ 39,072 Operating income 821 202 243 1,266 24 Weeks Ended February 14, 2021 Total revenue $ 63,419 $ 12,012 $ 12,546 $ 87,977 Operating income 1,638 529 603 2,770 24 Weeks Ended February 16, 2020 Total revenue $ 55,588 $ 10,358 $ 10,166 $ 76,112 Operating income 1,456 430 441 2,327 52 Weeks Ended August 30, 2020 Total revenue $ 122,142 $ 22,434 $ 22,185 $ 166,761 Operating income 3,633 860 942 5,435 Disaggregated Revenue The following table summarizes net sales by merchandise category; sales from business centers and e-commerce are allocated to the relevant categories: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 14, 2021 February 16, 2020 February 14, 2021 February 16, 2020 Foods and sundries $ 17,624 $ 14,984 $ 35,643 $ 29,516 Hardlines 8,306 6,774 15,636 12,617 Fresh foods 6,254 5,079 12,117 9,655 Softlines 5,417 4,504 10,471 8,801 Ancillary and other 6,287 6,915 12,368 13,903 Total net sales $ 43,888 $ 38,256 $ 86,235 $ 74,492 18 Table of Contents Item 2—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, and warehouse count data) FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

This management discussion should be read in conjunction with the management discussion included in our fiscal 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, previously filed with the SEC. OVERVIEW We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary and other businesses. We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced 19 Table of Contents by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China, the United States and the United Kingdom, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse business. The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. 20 Table of Contents Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack an e-commerce business. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the second quarter of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended February 14, 2021, and February 16, 2020, respectively. References to the first half of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 14, 2021, and February 16, 2020, respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Highlights for the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the second quarter of 2020 include: • Net sales increased 15% to $43,888, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 13% and sales at 18 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of 2020; • Membership fee revenue increased 8% to $881, driven by signups at warehouses and online and by upgrades to Executive Membership; • Gross margin percentage decreased two basis points, driven by certain ancillary and other businesses and incremental wages due to COVID-19, partially offset by increases in our core merchandise categories; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 11 basis points, primarily due to incremental wages as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by leveraging increased sales; • On January 21, 2021, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share, which was paid on February 19, 2021. The special cash dividend of $10.00 per share declared on November 16, 2020, was paid on December 11, 2020; and • Net income was $951, or $2.14 per diluted share, compared to $931, or $2.10 per diluted share in 2020. 21 Table of Contents COVID-19 As the COVID-19 pandemic persists we continue to operate as an essential business. We remain focused on our strategy while prioritizing the health and safety of our members and employees. We have taken a variety of measures, as described in Item 1A Risk Factors of our fiscal 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have impacted us across all reportable segments to varying degrees. We have recorded strong sales and profitability in our fresh foods, foods and sundries, and our e-commerce business. Conversely, we have experienced decreases in sales and profitability in certain of our ancillary and other businesses, primarily in our gasoline and travel businesses. COVID-related supply constraints have adversely affected some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future. We paid $246 and $458 in incremental wages during the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively, related to COVID-19. The incremental wage and benefit costs associated with COVID-19, which began on March 1, 2020 and ended on February 28, 2021, totaled approximately $825. Effective March 1, 2021, we implemented permanent wage increases for hourly and most salaried warehouse employees. The estimated annualized pre-tax cost of these permanent wage increases is approximately $400. Additionally, in certain areas where we do business in the United States, governments have mandated, or are considering mandating extra pay for classes of employees that include our employees, which will result in higher costs. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 14, 2021 February 16, 2020 February 14, 2021 February 16, 2020 Net Sales $ 43,888 $ 38,256 $ 86,235 $ 74,492 Increases in net sales: U.S 13 % 10 % 14 % 8 % Canada 15 % 9 % 16 % 6 % Other International 25 % 12 % 24 % 9 % Total Company 15 % 10 % 16 % 8 % Increases in comparable sales: U.S 11 % 9 % 13 % 7 % Canada 13 % 9 % 15 % 6 % Other International 22 % 8 % 20 % 6 % Total Company 13 % 9 % 14 % 7 % Increases in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency and gasoline prices: U.S 13 % 8 % 15 % 7 % Canada 11 % 7 % 14 % 6 % Other International 18 % 7 % 18 % 6 % Total Company 13 % 8 % 15 % 6 % 22 Table of Contents Net Sales Net sales increased $5,632 or 15%, and $11,743 or 16% during the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively, compared to the second quarter and first half of 2020. This improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 13% and 14% in the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively, and sales at the 18 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of 2020. During the second quarter and first half of 2021, we experienced increased sales in our core merchandise categories, both in our warehouses and online due in part to COVID-19. Sales in certain ancillary and other businesses weakened compared to the second quarter and first half of 2020, largely driven by our gasoline and travel businesses. During the second quarter of 2021, changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $367, or 96 basis points, compared to 2020, due to a 10% decrease in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold decreased approximately 9%, negatively impacting net sales by $341, or 89 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $423, or 110 basis points, compared to the second quarter of 2020, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. During the first half of 2021, changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $1,094, or 147 basis points, compared to 2020, due to a 15% decrease in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold decreased approximately 9%, negatively impacting net sales by $740, or 99 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $527, or 71 basis points, compared to the first half of 2020, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 13% and 14% in the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively, and were positively impacted by increases in average ticket and shopping frequency. There was an increase of 76% and 80% in e-commerce comparable sales in the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively. Membership Fees 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 14, 2021 February 16, 2020 February 14, 2021 February 16, 2020 Membership fees $ 881 $ 816 $ 1,742 $ 1,620 Membership fees as a percentage of net sales 2.01 % 2.13 % 2.02 % 2.17 % Total paid members (000s) 59,700 55,300 — — Total cardholders (000s) 108,300 100,900 — — Membership fees increased 8% in both the second quarter and first half of 2021, driven by signups at warehouses and online and by upgrades to Executive Membership. At the end of the second quarter of 2021, our member renewal rates were 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we standardized our membership count methodology globally to be consistent with the U.S. and Canada. If this standardization would have been done at the end of the second quarter of 2020, it would have resulted in an addition to the count of approximately 2.2 million total cardholders, of which 1.4 million were paid members. Membership fee income and the renewal rate calculations were not affected. 23 Table of Contents Gross Margin 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 14, 2021 February 16, 2020 February 14, 2021 February 16, 2020 Net sales $ 43,888 $ 38,256 $ 86,235 $ 74,492 Less merchandise costs 39,078 34,056 76,536 66,289 Gross margin $ 4,810 $ 4,200 $ 9,699 $ 8,203 Gross margin percentage 10.96 % 10.98 % 11.25 % 11.01 % Quarterly Results The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 71 basis points. This increase was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods, primarily as a result of efficiencies from increased sales. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Total gross margin percentage decreased two basis points compared to the second quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 10.87%, a decrease of 11 basis points. This was primarily due to a 55 basis point decrease in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, certain of which were negatively impacted by lower sales due to COVID-19, predominantly in our gasoline and travel businesses. The decreases in warehouse ancillary and other business were partially offset by e-commerce. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by incremental wages related to COVID-19 of 14 basis points and increased spending by members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program of five basis points. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 63 basis points in our core merchandise categories, predominantly fresh foods. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), performed similarly to the consolidated results above for our U.S. segment. The segment gross margin percentage increased in our Canadian and Other International segments, primarily due to increases in fresh foods and foods and sundries partially offset by incremental wages related to COVID-19 and increased spending by members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program. Year-to-date Results The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales, increased 72 basis points. This increase was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods where gross margins increased primarily as a result of efficiencies from increased sales. Total gross margin percentage increased 24 basis points compared to the first half of 2020. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 11.11%, an increase of ten basis points. This was primarily due to an increase of 68 basis points in our core merchandise categories, predominantly fresh foods and foods and sundries. These increases were partially offset by a 41 basis point decrease in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, certain of which were negatively impacted by lower sales due to COVID-19, predominantly our gasoline and travel businesses. The decreases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses were partially offset by e-commerce. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by incremental wages related to COVID-19 of 13 basis points and increased spending by members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program of four basis points. 24 Table of Contents The segment gross margin percentage decreased in our U.S. segment primarily due to warehouse ancillary and other businesses and incremental wages related to COVID-19, partially offset by increases in our core merchandise categories. Our Canada and Other International segments increased primarily due to certain of our core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses. These increases were partially offset by the incremental wages and increased spending by executive members discussed above.

SG&A expenses were negatively impacted by 42 basis points due to incremental wages as a result of COVID-19. Central operating costs were also higher by two basis points, largely in our U.S. segment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 38 basis points due to warehouse operations and other businesses, largely attributable to payroll and benefits, primarily due to leveraging increased sales. Stock compensation expense was lower by three basis points. Year-to-date Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased one basis point compared to the first half of 2020.

Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the openings relative to our quarter-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market. For the remainder of fiscal 2021, we expect to open 13 warehouses. 25 Table of Contents Interest Expense 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 14, 2021 February 16, 2020 February 14, 2021 February 16, 2020 Interest expense $ 40 $ 34 $ 79 $ 72 Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes.

See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Item 8, Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020.

This included $75 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation and $70 related to the portion of the special cash dividend payable through our 401(k) plan. The effective tax rate for the first half of 2020 was favorably impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $79, primarily related to excess tax benefits from stock compensation. Excluding the discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.4% and 26.2% for the first half of 2021 and 2020, respectively. 26 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 24 Weeks Ended February 14, 2021 February 16, 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,685 $ 2,721 Net cash used in investing activities (1,037) (1,100) Net cash used in financing activities (5,350) (2,228) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $9,254 and $13,305 at February 14, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $1,659 and $1,636 at February 14, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively. These receivables generally settle within four days. Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,685 in the first half of 2021, compared to $2,721 in the first half of 2020. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the strategic forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times to our members, payment terms with our suppliers, and the amount of payables paid early to obtain discounts from our suppliers. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,037 in the first half of 2021, compared to $1,100 in the first half of 2020, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Expenditure Plans Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first half of 2021, we spent $1,466 on capital expenditures. While COVID-19 has delayed certain construction projects, it is our current intention to spend between $3,000 and $3,200 during fiscal 2021. We opened 10 new warehouses, including two relocations, in the first half of 2021 and plan to open 13 additional new warehouses in the remainder of fiscal 2021. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized; plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $5,350 in the first half of 2021, compared to $2,228 in the first half of 2020. Cash flow used in financing activities was primarily related to the payment of dividends, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, and repurchases of common stock. 27 Table of Contents Dividends On January 21, 2021, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share payable to shareholders of record on February 5, 2021, which was paid on February 19, 2021. On December 11, 2020, an aggregate payment of approximately $4,430 was made in connection with the special cash dividend of $10.00 per share, declared on November 16, 2020. Stock Repurchase Program During the first half of 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 521,000 and 262,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $361.52 and $299.40, respectively, totaling approximately $189 and $79, respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At February 14, 2021, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,051. Our international operations maintain $575 of the borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $207 is guaranteed by the Company. There were no short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities at the end of the second quarter of 2021 or at the end of 2020. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $215. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the second quarter of 2021 totaled $181, most of which were standby letters of credit which do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. Contractual Obligations As of the date of this Report, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since the end of our last fiscal year. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments.

There have been no material changes to our market risks as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020. 28 Table of Contents Item 4—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of February 14, 2021 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

For the period ended November 22, 2020, Costco operated 803 warehouses worldwide: 558 in the United States (U.S.) located in 45 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 102 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 27 in Japan, 16 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 12 in Australia, three in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France and China. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2021 is a 52-week year ending on August 29, 2021. References to the first quarter of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 22, 2020, and November 24, 2019, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public and private sector policies and initiatives. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 8 Table of Contents Note 2—Acquisition of Innovel On March 17, 2020, the Company acquired Innovel Solutions for $ 998 using existing cash and cash equivalents. Innovel (now known as Costco Wholesale Logistics or CWL) provides final-mile delivery, installation and white-glove capabilities for big and bulky products across the United States and Puerto Rico. Its financial results have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. As of November 22, 2020, the initial accounting for the acquisition was incomplete, pending determination of the final purchase price, working capital adjustments, the fair value of operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and other assumed obligations. The net purchase price of $ 998 was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets of $ 283 and liabilities assumed of $ 219 , based on their preliminary fair values on the acquisition date. The remaining unallocated net purchase price of $ 934 was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the acquisition's benefits to the Company, which include the ability to serve more members and improve delivery times, enabling growth in certain segments of our U.S. e-commerce operations. The Company assigned this goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes, to reporting units within the U.S. segment. There were no changes to goodwill during the first quarter of 2021 . The changes to the purchase price allocation originally recorded in the third quarter of 2020 were not material. As additional information becomes available, the provisional fair value estimates will be refined. Note 3—Investments The Company's investments were as follows: November 22, 2020: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 471 $ 10 $ 481 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 352 — 352 Total short-term investments $ 823 $ 10 $ 833 August 30, 2020: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 436 $ 12 $ 448 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 580 — 580 Total short-term investments $ 1,016 $ 12 $ 1,028 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the periods ended November 22, 2020, and August 30, 2020 . At those dates, there were no available-for-sale securities in a continuous unrealized-loss position. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during the first quarter of 2021 or 2020. 9 Table of Contents The maturities of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities at November 22, 2020, are as follows: Available-For-Sale Held-To-Maturity Cost Basis Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 199 $ 199 $ 352 Due after one year through five years 272 282 — Total $ 471 $ 481 $ 352 Note 4—Fair Value Measurement Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The table below presents information regarding financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the level within the fair value hierarchy reflecting the valuation techniques utilized.

(2) The asset and liability values are included in other current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. At November 22, 2020, and August 30, 2020, the Company did not hold any Level 1 or 3 financial assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between levels during the first quarter of 2021 or 2020. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. There were no fair value adjustments to these items during the first quarter of 2021 or 2020. 10 Table of Contents Note 5—Debt The carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt consisted of the following: November 22, 2020 August 30, 2020 2.300% Senior Notes due May 2022 $ 800 $ 800 2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 1,000 1,000 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1,000 1,000 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1,250 1,250 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1,750 1,750 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 1,000 1,000 Other long-term debt 872 857 Total long-term debt 7,672 7,657 Less unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 47 48 Less current portion (1) 96 95 Long-term debt, excluding current portion $ 7,529 $ 7,514 _______________ (1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.

The fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $ 8,024 and $ 7,987 at November 22, 2020, and August 30, 2020, respectively. Note 6—Equity Dividends The Company’s current quarterly dividend is $ 0.70 per share, compared to $ 0.65 in the first quarter of 2020.

The following table summarizes RSU transactions during the first quarter of 2021 : Number of Units (in 000s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at August 30, 2020 5,174 $ 207.55 Granted 1,880 368.97 Vested and delivered ( 2,744 ) 235.77 Forfeited ( 21 ) 252.77 Outstanding at November 22, 2020 4,289 $ 260.03 The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSUs at November 22, 2020, was $ 1,045 , and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.8 years. Summary of Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits: 12 Weeks Ended November 22, 2020 November 24, 2019 Stock-based compensation expense $ 341 $ 301 Less recognized income tax benefit 75 66 Stock-based compensation expense, net $ 266 $ 235 Note 8—Taxes The Company's reported effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was 26.3 %, excluding the impact of discrete net tax benefits. The provision for income taxes was favorably impacted by discrete tax items, including $ 75 related to the excess tax benefit on stock compensation and $ 70 related to the special cash dividend payable to employees, who through the Costco 401(k) plan owned approximately 27,000,000 shares of Costco common stock through an employee stock ownership plan. Dividends on these shares are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. 12 Table of Contents Other Taxes The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. The possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. Note 9—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of basic and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000s): 12 Weeks Ended November 22, 2020 November 24, 2019 Net income attributable to Costco $ 1,166 $ 844 Weighted average basic shares 442,952 441,818 RSUs 1,434 1,862 Weighted average diluted shares 444,386 443,680 Anti-dilutive RSUs 432 — Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in an action under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to member service assistants who act as greeters in the Company’s California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. ( Case No. 5:13-CV-03598; N.D. Cal.; filed July 1, 2013).

The action has been remanded to state court. 13 Table of Contents In January 2019, an employee brought similar claims for relief concerning Costco employees engaged at member services counters in California. Rodriguez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. RG19001310; Alameda Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that depot employees in California did not receive suitable seating or appropriate workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Dec. 6, 2018 Notice to California Labor and Workforce Development Agency). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In October 2019, the parties reached an agreement to settle the seating claims on a representative basis, which received court approval in February 2020. In January 2019, a former seasonal employee filed a class action, alleging failure to provide California seasonal employees meal and rest breaks, proper wage statements, and appropriate wages. Jadan v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-CV-340438; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. In October 2019, the parties reached an agreement on a class settlement, which received preliminary court approval in July 2020. In March 2019, employees filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods and itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-03454; C.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2019, the court issued an order denying class certification. In January 2020, the plaintiffs dismissed their Labor Code claims without prejudice, and the court remanded the action to state court. The remand is being appealed. In May 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 2:19-cv-01340; E.D. Cal.). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The Company has moved to dismiss or strike portions of the complaint. In August 2019, Rough filed a companion case in state court seeking penalties under PAGA. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. FCS053454; Sonoma County Superior Court). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The state court action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal action. In June 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods, itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices.

Schwab v. Costco Wholesale Corporation (Case No. 37-2020-00023551-CU-OE-CTL; San Diego County Superior Court). In August 2020, the Company filed a motion to strike portions of the complaint. 14 Table of Contents In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are federal cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina and a third-party payor in Ohio, class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 41 states and American Samoa. In 2019, similar actions were commenced against the Company in state court in Utah. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of these matters. The Company and its CEO and CFO are defendants in putative class actions brought on behalf of shareholders who acquired Company stock between June 6 and October 25, 2018. Johnson v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash.; filed Nov. 5, 2018); Chen v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash.; filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaints allege violations of the federal securities laws stemming from the Company’s disclosures concerning internal control over financial reporting. They seek unspecified damages, equitable relief, interest, and costs and attorneys’ fees. On January 30, 2019, an order was entered consolidating the actions, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on April 16, 2019. On November 26, 2019, the court entered an order dismissing the consolidated amended complaint and granting the plaintiffs leave to file a further amended complaint. A further amended complaint was filed on March 9, which the court dismissed with prejudice on August 19, 2020. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in September 2020. Members of the Board of Directors, one other individual, and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to the internal controls and related disclosures identified in the putative class actions, alleging that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties. Wedekind v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (W.D. Wash.; filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement of compensation, corporate governance changes, and costs and attorneys' fees. Because the complaint is derivative in nature, it does not seek monetary damages from the Company, which is a nominal defendant. By agreement among the parties the action has been stayed pending further proceedings in the class action. Similar actions were filed in King County Superior Court on February 20, 2019, Elliott v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-04824-7), April 16, 2019, Brad Shuman, et ano. v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-10460-1), and June 12, 2019, Rahul Modi v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-15514-1). These actions have also been stayed. On June 23, 2020, a putative class action was filed against the Company, the “Board of Directors,” the “Costco Benefits Committee” and others under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Dustin S. Soulek v. Costco Wholesale, et al. , Case No. 20-cv-937. The class is alleged to be beneficiaries of the Costco 401(k) plan from June 23, 2014, and the claims are that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in the operation and oversight of the plan. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, damages, interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. On September 11, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and on September 21 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which the defendants have also moved to dismiss. 15 Table of Contents The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. Note 11—Segment Reporting The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which consider geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020, and Note 1 above. Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, are incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, but are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally come under the responsibility of the Company's U.S. management team. The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments: United States Operations Canadian Operations Other International Operations Total 12 Weeks Ended November 22, 2020 Total revenue $ 31,292 $ 6,011 $ 5,905 $ 43,208 Operating income 848 293 289 1,430 12 Weeks Ended November 24, 2019 Total revenue $ 27,065 $ 5,127 $ 4,848 $ 37,040 Operating income 635 228 198 1,061 52 Weeks Ended August 30, 2020 Total revenue $ 122,142 $ 22,434 $ 22,185 $ 166,761 Operating income 3,633 860 942 5,435 Disaggregated Revenue The following table summarizes net sales by merchandise category; sales from business centers and e-commerce are allocated to the relevant categories: 12 Weeks Ended November 22, 2020 November 24, 2019 Foods and sundries $ 18,019 $ 14,532 Hardlines 7,330 5,843 Fresh foods 5,863 4,576 Softlines 5,054 4,297 Ancillary and other 6,081 6,988 Total net sales $ 42,347 $ 36,236 16 Table of Contents Item 2—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, and warehouse count data) FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

This management discussion should be read in conjunction with the management discussion included in our fiscal 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, previously filed with the SEC. OVERVIEW We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary and other businesses. We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced 17 Table of Contents by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse business. The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. 18 Table of Contents Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack an e-commerce business. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the first quarter of 2021 and 2020 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 22, 2020, and November 24, 2019, respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Highlights for the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 include: • Net sales increased 17% to $42,347, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 15% and sales at 18 net new warehouses opened since the end of the first quarter of 2020; • Membership fee revenue increased 7% to $861, primarily due to sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and online and upgrades to Executive Membership; • Gross margin percentage increased 50 basis points, driven by certain core merchandise categories, partially offset by certain ancillary and other businesses; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 15 basis points primarily due to leveraging increased sales, partially offset by incremental wages as a result of COVID-19; • On October 14, 2020, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share, which was paid on November 13, 2020; • On November 16, 2020, our Board declared a special cash dividend of $10.00 per share, which was paid on December 11, 2020; • The provision for income taxes was impacted by: a benefit related to stock compensation of $75, or $0.17 per diluted share compared to $77, or $0.17 in the first quarter of 2020; and a benefit of $70, or $0.16 per diluted share, in connection with the portion of the special dividend payable to our 401(k) participants; and • Net income was $1,166, or $2.62 per diluted share, compared to $844, or $1.90 per diluted share in 2020. 19 Table of Contents COVID-19 As the COVID-19 pandemic persists and, in many areas, confirmed cases rise, we have operated as an essential business. We remain focused on our strategy while prioritizing the health and safety of our members and employees. We have taken a variety of measures, as described in Item 1A Risk Factors of our fiscal 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and their implications on our results of operations have impacted us across all reportable segments to varying degrees. We have recorded strong sales increases in our fresh foods and foods and sundries merchandise categories. This growth has led to improved gross margin and SG&A percentages, as we leveraged these sales to achieve greater efficiency. Our e-commerce business has also benefited, as more members have shopped online. Conversely, we have experienced decreases in both the sales and profitability in certain of our ancillary and other businesses. Additionally, we paid $212 in incremental wages during the first quarter of 2021 related to COVID-19. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 12 Weeks Ended November 22, 2020 November 24, 2019 Net Sales $ 42,347 $ 36,236 Increases in net sales: U.S 16 % 6 % Canada 18 % 3 % Other International 22 % 7 % Total Company 17 % 6 % Increases in comparable sales: U.S 15 % 5 % Canada 16 % 3 % Other International 19 % 3 % Total Company 15 % 4 % Increases in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency and gasoline prices: U.S 17 % 5 % Canada 17 % 5 % Other International 18 % 4 % Total Company 17 % 5 % Net Sales Net sales increased $6,111 or 17% during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. This improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 15% in the first quarter of 2021 , and sales at the 18 net new warehouses opened since the end of the first quarter of 2020. During the first quarter of 2021, we experienced strong results in our core merchandise categories, primarily fresh foods and foods and sundries, as well as in our e-commerce business as a result of COVID-19. Sales in certain ancillary and other businesses weakened compared to the first quarter of 2020, largely driven by price deflation and lower volume in our gasoline business, and minimal demand in our travel business. 20 Table of Contents Changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $727, or 201 basis points, compared to 2020, due to a 19% decrease in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold decreased approximately 10%, negatively impacting net sales by $399, or 110 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $105, or 29 basis points, compared to the first quarter of 2020, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 15% in the first quarter of 2021 , and were positively impacted by increases in average ticket and shopping frequency. There was an increase of 86% in e-commerce comparable sales in the first quarter of 2021. Membership Fees 12 Weeks Ended November 22, 2020 November 24, 2019 Membership fees $ 861 $ 804 Membership fees as a percentage of net sales 2.03 % 2.22 % Total paid members (000s) 59,100 54,700 Total cardholders (000s) 107,100 99,900 Membership fees increased 7% in the first quarter of 2021, due primarily to signups at existing and new warehouses and online and upgrades to Executive Membership. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, our member renewal rates were 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. Gross Margin 12 Weeks Ended November 22, 2020 November 24, 2019 Net sales $ 42,347 $ 36,236 Less merchandise costs 37,458 32,233 Gross margin $ 4,889 $ 4,003 Gross margin percentage 11.55 % 11.05 % The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 65 basis points. This increase was across all categories, but most significantly in fresh foods, where gross margins increased primarily as a result of efficiencies from increased sales. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Total gross margin percentage increased 50 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 11.35%, an increase of 30 basis points. This was primarily due to a 66 basis point increase in core merchandise categories, predominantly fresh foods and foods and sundries. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses decreased 20 basis points, as certain of these businesses were negatively impacted by lower sales due to COVID-19. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by incremental wages related to COVID-19 of 12 21 Table of Contents basis points and increased spending by members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program of four basis points. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales, performed similarly to the consolidated results above other than the warehouse ancillary and other businesses in our Canada and Other International segments, which increased overall due to their gasoline and e-commerce operations. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 12 Weeks Ended November 22, 2020 November 24, 2019 SG&A expenses $ 4,298 $ 3,732 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 10.15 % 10.30 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 15 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation, was 9.98%, a decrease of 32 basis points compared to the prior year. Warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by 62 basis points, largely attributable to payroll and benefits, primarily due to leveraging increased sales. Stock compensation expense was lower by four basis points and central operating costs were lower by three basis points. SG&A expenses were negatively impacted by 37 basis points due to incremental wages as a result of COVID-19. Preopening Expense 12 Weeks Ended November 22, 2020 November 24, 2019 Preopening expenses $ 22 $ 14 Warehouse openings, including relocations United States 7 3 Canada 2 1 Other International 1 — Total warehouse openings, including relocations 10 4 Preopening expenses include startup costs related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the openings relative to our quarter-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market. For the remainder of fiscal 2021, we expect to open 12 to 14 warehouses. Interest Expense 12 Weeks Ended November 22, 2020 November 24, 2019 Interest expense $ 39 $ 38 Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes. 22 Table of Contents Interest Income and Other, Net 12 Weeks Ended November 22, 2020 November 24, 2019 Interest income $ 10 $ 32 Foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), net 8 (4) Other, net 11 7 Interest income and other, net $ 29 $ 35 Interest income decreased in the first quarter 2021 due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash and investment balances. Foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), net include the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations and mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts. See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Item 8, Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020. Provision for Income Taxes 12 Weeks Ended November 22, 2020 November 24, 2019 Provision for income taxes $ 239 $ 202 Effective tax rate 16.8 % 19.1 % The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was favorably impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $135. This was primarily attributable to $75 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation and $70 related to the special cash dividend payable to employees, who through our 401(k) plan owned shares of Costco common stock through an employee stock ownership plan. Employees owned approximately 27,000,000 shares of Costco stock through our 401(k) plan. Excluding net discrete tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.3% for the first quarter of 2021. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was favorably impacted by $77 due to excess tax benefits from stock compensation. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 12 Weeks Ended November 22, 2020 November 24, 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,647 $ 2,102 Net cash used in investing activities (682) (630) Net cash used in financing activities (700) (836) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $14,423 and $13,305 at November 22, 2020, and August 30, 2020, respectively. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $2,048 and $1,636 at November 22, 2020, and August 30, 2020, respectively. These receivables generally settle within four days. Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. 23 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,647 in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $2,102 in the first quarter of 2020. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, payment terms with our suppliers, and the amount of payables paid early to obtain discounts from our suppliers. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $682 in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $630 in the first quarter of 2020, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Expenditure Plans Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first quarter of 2021, we spent $893 on capital expenditures. While the impacts of COVID-19 have delayed certain construction projects, it is our current intention to spend between $3,000 and $3,200 during fiscal 2021. We opened 10 new warehouses, including two relocations, in the first quarter of 2021 and plan to open 12 to 14 additional new warehouses in the remainder of fiscal 2021. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized; plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $700 in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $836 in the first quarter of 2020. Cash flow used in financing activities was primarily related to withholding taxes on stock-based awards, the payment of dividends, and repurchases of common stock. Stock Repurchase Programs During the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 213,000 and 100,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $359.45 and $295.97, respectively, totaling approximately $77 and $30, respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Dividends On October 14, 2020, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share payable to shareholders of record on October 30, 2020, which was paid on November 13, 2020. On November 16, 2020, the Board declared a special cash dividend of $10.00 per share, which was paid on December 11, 2020. The special dividend was approximately $4,430 and was included in other current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at November 22, 2020. 24 Table of Contents Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At November 22, 2020, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,002. Our international operations maintain $526 of the borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $207 is guaranteed by the Company. There were no short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities at the end of the first quarter of 2021 or at the end of 2020. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $212. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the first quarter of 2021 totaled $177, most of which were standby letters of credit which do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. Contractual Obligations As of the date of this Report, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since the end of our last fiscal year.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data) (unaudited) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. For the period ended May 10, 2020, Costco operated 787 warehouses worldwide: 547 in the United States (U.S.) located in 45 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 100 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 26 in Japan, 16 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, 12 in Australia, two in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France and China. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material intercompany transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. In February 2020, the Company acquired a 35 % interest in Navitus Health Solutions (Navitus), a pharmacy benefit manager, and is accounted for as an equity-method investment and included in the Company's earnings. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2019. Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2020 is a 52-week year ending on August 30, 2020. References to the third quarter of 2020 and 2019 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended May 10, 2020, and May 12, 2019, respectively. References to the first thirty-six weeks of 2020 and 2019 relate to the 36 weeks ended May 10, 2020, and May 12, 2019, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited 9 Table of Contents to the potential impacts arising from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and public and private sector policies and initiatives aimed at reducing its transmission. As the extent and duration of these impacts remain unclear, the Company's estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Leases The Company leases land and/or buildings at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities. Leases generally contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair market value; or (c) a right of first refusal in the event of a third-party offer. Some leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. As the rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not easily determinable, the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated by using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or if circumstances indicate its carrying value may exceed the fair value. This evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach. The income approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results. Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable segment during the first thirty-six weeks of 2020 : United States Operations Canadian Operations Other International Operations Total Balance as of September 1, 2019 $ 13 $ 27 $ 13 $ 53 Changes in currency translation — ( 1 ) — ( 1 ) Acquisition 935 — — 935 Balance as of May 10, 2020 $ 948 $ 26 $ 13 $ 987 Definite-lived intangible assets are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit. 10 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02 - Leases (ASC 842), which required recognition on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by leases with terms greater than 12 months. The Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective transition method and elected to use the effective date of September 2, 2019, as the date of initial application. Consequently, the comparative periods presented continue to be in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, previously in effect. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, allowing the Company to carry forward conclusions related to: (a) whether expired or existing contracts contain leases; (b) lease classification; and (c) initial direct costs for existing leases. The Company has elected not to record operating lease right-of-use assets or lease liabilities associated with leases with durations of 12 months or less. Lastly, the Company elected the practical expedient allowing aggregation of non-lease components with related lease components when evaluating the accounting treatment for all classes of underlying assets. Adoption of the new standard resulted in an initial increase to assets and liabilities of $ 2,632 related to recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease obligations as of September 2, 2019. Other line item impacts in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet were not material. The standard did not materially impact the condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flows. For more information on the Company's lease arrangements refer to Note 6 . Note 2—Acquisition of Innovel On March 17, 2020, the Company acquired Innovel Solutions for $ 998 using existing cash and cash equivalents. Cash paid during the third quarter excludes a portion of the purchase price that will be paid upon the final settlement of certain holdbacks and provisional amounts, discussed below. Innovel provides final mile delivery, complete installation and white-glove capabilities for big and bulky products across the United States and Puerto Rico. Its financial results have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Innovel's results of operations were not material to the Company's consolidated results during the current quarter. At May 10, 2020, the initial accounting for the acquisition was incomplete pending determination of: the final purchase price, working capital adjustments, the fair value of intangible assets, property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and other assumed obligations. The net purchase price of $ 998 was initially allocated to the tangible and intangible assets of $ 255 and liabilities assumed of $ 192 , based on their preliminary fair values on the acquisition date. The remaining unallocated net purchase price of $ 935 was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the acquisition's benefits to the Company, which include the ability to serve more members and improve delivery times, enabling growth in certain segments of our U.S. e-commerce operations. The Company assigned this goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes, to reporting units within the U.S. segment. As additional information becomes available, the provisional fair value estimates will be refined. 11 Table of Contents Note 3—Investments The Company's investments were as follows: May 10, 2020: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 464 $ 14 $ 478 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 470 470 Total short-term investments $ 934 $ 14 $ 948 September 1, 2019: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 716 $ 6 $ 722 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 338 338 Total short-term investments $ 1,054 $ 6 $ 1,060 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the periods ended May 10, 2020, and September 1, 2019 . At May 10, 2020, there were no available-for-sale securities in a continuous unrealized-loss position. At September 1, 2019, available-for-sale securities that were in a continuous unrealized-loss position were not material. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during the first thirty-six weeks of 2020 or 2019. The maturities of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities at May 10, 2020, are as follows: Available-For-Sale Held-To-Maturity Cost Basis Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 169 $ 170 $ 470 Due after one year through five years 295 308 0 Total $ 464 $ 478 $ 470 12 Table of Contents Note 4—Fair Value Measurement Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The table below presents information regarding financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the level within the fair value hierarchy reflecting the valuation techniques utilized to determine fair value.

There were no transfers between levels during the first thirty-six weeks of 2020 or 2019. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. There were no fair value adjustments to these items during the first thirty-six weeks of 2020 or 2019. 13 Table of Contents Note 5—Debt The carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt consisted of the following: May 10, 2020 September 1, 2019 1.700% Senior Notes due December 2019 $ 0 $ 1,200 1.750% Senior Notes due February 2020 0 500 2.150% Senior Notes due May 2021 1,000 1,000 2.250% Senior Notes due February 2022 500 500 2.300% Senior Notes due May 2022 800 800 2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 1,000 1,000 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1,000 1,000 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1,250 0 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1,750 0 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 1,000 0 Other long-term debt 849 852 Total long-term debt 9,149 6,852 Less unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 54 29 Less current portion (1) 1,497 1,699 Long-term debt, excluding current portion $ 7,598 $ 5,124 _______________ (1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.

The remaining amount available for stock repurchases under the approved plan was $ 3,833 at May 10, 2020. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Note 8—Stock-Based Compensation The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares ( 10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate of 27,800,000 shares ( 15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes. Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity At May 10, 2020, 13,576,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards were outstanding: • 5,081,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time; • 30,000 performance-based RSUs, granted to executive officers of the Company, for which the performance targets have been met.

These awards are included in the table below and the Company recognized compensation expense for these awards as it is currently deemed probable that the targets will be achieved. 17 Table of Contents The following table summarizes RSU transactions during the first thirty-six weeks of 2020 : Number of Units (in 000s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at September 1, 2019 6,496 $ 167.55 Granted 2,252 294.08 Vested and delivered ( 3,362 ) 188.91 Forfeited ( 152 ) 196.52 Outstanding at May 10, 2020 5,234 $ 207.45 The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSUs at May 10, 2020, was $ 817 , and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.7 years. Summary of Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 Stock-based compensation expense $ 88 $ 93 $ 508 $ 482 Less recognized income tax benefit 18 20 105 104 Stock-based compensation expense, net $ 70 $ 73 $ 403 $ 378 Note 9—Taxes In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act was signed into law. While the Company is still assessing the impact of the legislation, it is not expected to have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. Other Taxes The Company is undergoing multiple examinations for value-added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. In September 2019, the Company received an assessment related to a product tax audit covering multiple years. The Company recorded the charge in fiscal 2019 and is protesting the assessment. No adjustments have been made to this estimate in 2020. Other possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 18 Table of Contents Note 10—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of basic and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000s): 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 Net income attributable to Costco $ 838 $ 906 $ 2,613 $ 2,562 Weighted average basic shares 442,322 439,859 442,054 439,767 RSUs 1,533 2,783 1,700 2,798 Weighted average diluted shares 443,855 442,642 443,754 442,565 Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in a class action alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to member service assistants who act as greeters in the Company’s California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (Case No. 5:13-CV-03598; N.D. Cal.; filed July 1, 2013). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. The action has been stayed pending review by the Ninth Circuit. In January 2019, an employee brought similar claims for relief concerning Costco employees engaged at member services counters in California. Rodriguez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. RG19001310; Alameda Superior Court; filed Jan. 4, 2019). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that depot employees in California did not receive suitable seating or appropriate workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Dec. 6, 2018 Notice to California Labor and Workforce Development Agency). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In October 2019, the parties reached an agreement to settle the seating claims on a representative basis, which received court approval in February 2020. 19 Table of Contents In January 2019, a former seasonal employee filed a class action, alleging failure to provide California seasonal employees meal and rest breaks, proper wage statements, and appropriate wages. Jadan v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-CV-340438; Santa Clara Superior Court; filed Jan. 3, 2019). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. In October 2019, the parties reached an agreement on a class settlement, which is subject to court approval. In March 2019, employees filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods and itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-03454; C.D. Cal.; filed Mar. 25, 2019). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2019, the court issued an order denying class certification. In January 2020, the Plaintiffs dismissed their Labor Code claims without prejudice and the court remanded the action to state court. The remand is being appealed. In May 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 2:19-cv-01340; E.D. Cal.; filed May 28, 2019). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. In August 2019, Rough filed a companion case in state court seeking penalties under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. FCS053454, Sonoma County Superior Court, filed August 23, 2019). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The state court action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal action. In June 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods, itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Martinez v. Costco Wholesale Corp . (Case No. 3:19-cv-05624; N.D. Cal.; filed June 11, 2019). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In April 2020, an employee, alleging underpayment of sick pay, filed a class and representative action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay all wages at termination and for Labor Code penalties under the California Private Attorneys General Act. Kristy v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 20CV366341; Santa Clara County Superior Court). In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others concerning the impacts of opioid abuse. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are federal cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 43 states and American Samoa. In 2019, similar actions were commenced against the Company in state court in Utah. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of these matters. 20 Table of Contents The Company and its CEO and CFO are defendants in putative class actions brought on behalf of shareholders who acquired Company stock between June 6 and October 25, 2018. Johnson v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash. filed Nov. 5, 2018); Chen v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash. filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaints allege violations of the federal securities laws stemming from the Company’s disclosures concerning internal control over financial reporting. They seek unspecified damages, equitable relief, interest, and costs and attorneys’ fees. On January 30, 2019, an order was entered consolidating the actions, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on April 16, 2019. On November 26, 2019, the court entered an order dismissing the consolidated amended complaint and granting the plaintiffs leave to file a further amended complaint. A further amended complaint was filed on March 9, which the Company moved to dismiss on April 23. Members of the Board of Directors, one other individual, and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to the internal controls and related disclosures identified in the putative class actions, alleging that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties. Wedekind v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (W.D. Wash. filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement of compensation, corporate governance changes, and costs and attorneys' fees. Because the complaint is derivative in nature, it does not seek monetary damages from the Company, which is a nominal defendant. By agreement among the parties the action has been stayed pending further proceedings in the class actions. Similar actions were filed in King County Superior Court on February 20, 2019, Elliott v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-04824-7), April 16, 2019, Brad Shuman, et ano. v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-10460-1), and June 12, 2019, Rahul Modi v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-15514-1). These actions have also been stayed. In November 2016 and September 2017, the Company received notices of violation from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection regarding hazardous waste practices at its Connecticut warehouses, primarily concerning unsalable pharmaceuticals. The relief to be sought is not known at this time. The Company is seeking to cooperate concerning the resolution of these notices. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 21 Table of Contents Note 12—Segment Reporting The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which consider geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2019, and Note 1 above. Intersegment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, are incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, but are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally come under the responsibility of the Company's U.S. management team.

OVERVIEW We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary and other businesses. We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced 23 Table of Contents by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions (primarily impacting our U.S. and Canadian operations). The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods– consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse business. The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. 24 Table of Contents Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, and may lack an e-commerce business. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the third quarter of 2020 and 2019 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended May 10, 2020, and May 12, 2019, respectively. References to the first thirty-six weeks of 2020 and 2019 relate to the 36 weeks ended May 10, 2020, and May 12, 2019, respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Highlights for the third quarter of 2020 as compared to the third quarter of 2019 include: • Net sales increased 7% to $36,451, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 5% and sales at 15 net new warehouses opened since the end of the third quarter of 2019; • Membership fee revenue increased 5% to $815, primarily due to sign-ups at existing and new warehouses; • Gross margin percentage increased 54 basis points, driven by certain core merchandise categories and our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, primarily gasoline; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 59 basis points primarily due to incremental wage and sanitation costs as a result of COVID-19; • Net income was $838, or $1.89 per diluted share, compared to $906, or $2.05 per diluted share in 2019. Net income was negatively impacted by $283 pretax, or $0.47 per diluted share, from incremental wage and sanitation costs related to COVID-19 while 2019 included the benefit of a non-recurring tax item of $73, or $0.16 per share; • In March 2020, we acquired Innovel Solutions, a company that provides final mile delivery, complete installation and white-glove capabilities for big and bulky products across the United States and Puerto Rico; • In April 2020, we issued $4,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes; and • On April 15, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share, an increase of 8%, which was paid on May 15, 2020. 25 Table of Contents COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that COVID-19 infections had become a pandemic, and shortly afterward the U.S. declared a National Emergency. The outbreak has led to widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and is adversely affecting many aspects of our business and the operations of others with which we do business. We temporarily reduced warehouse operating hours, increased compensation levels for certain employees, and required some employees to work remotely. We have taken other steps in warehouses to protect the health of our members and employees, including limiting the member density in warehouses and ceasing sales of certain merchandise or services. Generally, these measures and their implications on our results of operations have impacted us across all our reportable segments to varying degrees. There is uncertainty regarding the expected extent and duration of counter-measures that impact our business, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business and government shutdowns. Therefore, the ultimate impacts to our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity, cannot now be reasonably estimated. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 Net Sales $ 36,451 $ 33,964 $ 110,943 $ 102,903 Changes in net sales: U.S 8 % 9 % 8 % 10 % Canada (1) % 3 % 4 % 3 % Other International 11 % 4 % 10 % 5 % Total Company 7 % 7 % 8 % 8 % Changes in comparable sales: U.S 6 % 7 % 7 % 9 % Canada (3) % 1 % 3 % 1 % Other International 6 % 2 % 6 % 2 % Total Company 5 % 6 % 6 % 7 % Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency and gasoline prices (1) : U.S 8 % 6 % 7 % 7 % Canada 3 % 5 % 5 % 6 % Other International 12 % 7 % 8 % 6 % Total Company 8 % 6 % 7 % 7 % _______________ (1) Excludes the impact of the revenue recognition standard for the periods ended May 12, 2019. Net Sales Net sales increased $2,487 or 7%, and $8,040 or 8% during the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2020 , respectively, compared to the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2019. These increases were attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 5% and 6% in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2020 , respectively, and sales at the 15 net new warehouses opened since the end of the third quarter 26 Table of Contents of 2019. During the third quarter of 2020, due to COVID-19, we experienced a significant sales shift from our ancillary and other businesses to certain of our core merchandise categories, primarily food and sundries and fresh foods. This was largely driven by lower volume and price deflation in our gasoline business; closures of most of our optical, hearing aid and photo departments; and limited service in our travel business and food courts. In addition, we experienced a decrease in sales in our softlines category, primarily in apparel. During the third quarter of 2020, changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $671, or 197 basis points, due to a 21% decrease in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold decreased approximately 20% as a result of less driving due to COVID-19. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $407, or 120 basis points, compared to the third quarter of 2019, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. During the first thirty-six weeks of 2020 , changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $473, or 46 basis points, due to a 4% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $425, or 41 basis points, compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2019, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 5% and 6% in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2020 , respectively. During the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2020 , comparable sales were positively impacted by increases in average ticket, which were partially offset in the third quarter by decreases in traffic due to capacity restrictions and stay-at-home orders related to COVID-19. The decrease in traffic was also impacted by a shift to shopping online, resulting in an increase of 65% in e-commerce comparable sales in the third quarter of 2020. Membership Fees 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 Membership fees $ 815 $ 776 $ 2,435 $ 2,302 Membership fees as a percentage of net sales 2.24 % 2.29 % 2.20 % 2.24 % Total paid members (000s) 55,800 53,100 — — Total cardholders (000s) 101,800 97,200 — — Membership fees increased 5% and 6% in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2020 . This was primarily due to signups at existing and new warehouses. At the end of the third quarter of 2020 , our member renewal rates were 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide. 27 Table of Contents Gross Margin 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 Net sales $ 36,451 $ 33,964 $ 110,943 $ 102,903 Less merchandise costs 32,249 30,233 98,538 91,576 Gross margin $ 4,202 $ 3,731 $ 12,405 $ 11,327 Gross margin percentage 11.53 % 10.99 % 11.18 % 11.01 % Quarterly Results The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 17 basis points. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. These decreases were across all categories, except fresh foods, which benefited from operational efficiencies from increased sales, partially offset by operating losses from our poultry processing plant. The decreases in all other merchandise categories were largely due to changes in sales mix, both between and within merchandise categories. Total gross margin percentage increased 54 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.32%, an increase of 33 basis points. This was primarily due to a 33 basis-point increase in our core merchandise categories, predominantly food and sundries and fresh foods, partially offset by softlines and hardlines. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses increased 21 basis points, primarily due to our gasoline business, partially offset by certain ancillary businesses, which were negatively impacted by COVID-19 related closures or restrictions. These increases were partially offset by the incremental wage and sanitation costs related to COVID-19 of $44 or 12 basis points, $20 or five basis points related to a reserve for certain inventory, and a four basis-point decrease due to increased spending by members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), was impacted by increases in food and sundries and fresh foods and decreases in softlines and hardlines in each of our U.S., Canadian, and Other International segments. Each of our segments was also negatively impacted by the incremental wage and sanitation costs as a result of COVID-19. The segment gross margin percentage in our U.S. and Other International operations increased, primarily due to core merchandise categories, as discussed above, and were also positively impacted by warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly our gasoline business. Our Canadian segment gross margin percentage decreased due to softlines, hardlines and warehouse ancillary and other businesses, partially offset by increases in fresh foods and food and sundries. Year-to-date Results The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales, decreased nine basis points. This was attributable to decreases in hardlines and food and sundries, partially offset by increases in fresh foods and softlines. Fresh foods gross margin increased as a result of operational efficiencies from increased sales in the third quarter despite operating losses from our poultry processing plant. Total gross margin percentage increased 17 basis points compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2019. Excluding the impacts of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.13%, an increase of 12 basis points from the first thirty-six weeks of 2019. This was primarily due to a 13 basis point increase in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly our gasoline business, partially offset by certain ancillary businesses which were negatively impacted by 28 Table of Contents COVID-19 related closures or restrictions. An adjustment in the first quarter of 2019 to our estimate of breakage on rewards earned under our co-branded credit card program positively impacted gross margin by four basis points, which was offset by four basis points for incremental wage and sanitation costs and two basis points related to a reserve for certain inventory, both discussed above. Core merchandise categories increased by one basis point which was driven by increases in food and sundries and fresh foods, partially offset by decreases in softlines and hardlines. Gross margin on a segment basis was impacted by increases in food and sundries and fresh foods and decreases in softlines and hardlines in each of our U.S., Canadian, and Other International segments. Each of our segments was also negatively impacted by the incremental wage and sanitation costs as a result of COVID-19. The segment gross margin percentage increased in our U.S. operations, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly our gasoline business, as well as the prior year breakage adjustment discussed above. The segment gross margin percentage increased in our Other International operations primarily due to core merchandise categories, as discussed above. Our Canadian segment gross margin percentage decreased due to hardlines, softlines and warehouse ancillary and other businesses, partially offset by increases in fresh foods and food and sundries. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 SG&A expenses $ 3,830 $ 3,371 $ 11,305 $ 10,310 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 10.51 % 9.92 % 10.19 % 10.02 % Quarterly Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 59 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, SG&A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.32%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the prior year. SG&A expenses were negatively impacted by approximately $239 or 64 basis points due to incremental wage and sanitation costs as a result of COVID-19. Excluding this impact, costs related to warehouse operations and other businesses, which include e-commerce and travel, were lower by 24 basis points compared to the prior year. This decrease was largely due to leveraging increased sales in certain of our core merchandise categories. Stock compensation expense was lower by three basis points and central operating costs were lower by two basis points. SG&A expenses were negatively impacted by approximately $19 or five basis points due to costs associated with the acquisition of Innovel (see Note 2 in the condensed consolidated financial statements). Year-to-date Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 17 basis points compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2019. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, SG&A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.15%, an increase of 13 basis points compared to the prior year. SG&A expenses were negatively impacted by approximately $239 or 21 basis points due to incremental wage and sanitation costs as discussed above as a result of COVID-19. Excluding this impact, costs related to warehouse operations and other businesses, which include e-commerce and travel, decreased 10 basis points due to leveraging increased sales in certain of our core merchandise categories. SG&A expenses were negatively impacted by approximately $19 or two basis points due to costs associated with the acquisition of Innovel. 29 Table of Contents Preopening Expense 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 Preopening expenses $ 8 $ 14 $ 29 $ 45 Warehouse openings, including relocations United States 1 1 4 9 Canada 0 0 1 2 Other International 1 2 1 2 Total warehouse openings, including relocations 2 3 6 13 Preopening expenses include startup costs related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the openings relative to our quarter-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market. For the remainder of fiscal 2020, we expect to open 10 warehouses, including two relocations. Interest Expense 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 Interest expense $ 37 $ 35 $ 109 $ 105 Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes and finance leases. In April 2020, we issued $4,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes (see Note 5 in the condensed consolidated financial statements). A portion of the proceeds from this issuance was used to repay, prior to maturity, the 2.150% and 2.250% Senior Notes subsequent to the end of the quarter. The early redemption resulted in a $36 charge, which will be recorded in Interest Income and Other in the fourth quarter of 2020. Interest Income and Other, Net 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 Interest income $ 10 $ 27 $ 72 $ 81 Foreign-currency transaction gains, net 5 3 9 6 Other, net 6 6 20 17 Interest income and other, net $ 21 $ 36 $ 101 $ 104 Interest income decreased for the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2020 due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash and investment balances. Foreign-currency transaction gains, net, include the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations and mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts. See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Item 8, Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2019. 30 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 Provision for income taxes $ 311 $ 207 $ 843 $ 679 Effective tax rate 26.7 % 18.5 % 24.1 % 20.7 % The effective tax rate for the first thirty-six weeks of 2020 included discrete net tax benefits of $68. Excluding these benefits, the tax rate was 26.1% for the first thirty-six weeks of 2020. The effective tax rate for the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 included discrete net tax benefits of $165. During the third quarter of 2019, we recognized a net benefit of $73 related to U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends, net of losses of current year foreign tax credits, which impacted the effective tax rate. The tax rate for the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 was 26.8%, excluding the discrete benefits, but including the impact of the lost foreign tax credits. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 36 Weeks Ended May 10, 2020 May 12, 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,619 $ 4,063 Net cash used in investing activities (2,950) (1,945) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 771 (1,146) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $11,774 and $9,444 at May 10, 2020, and September 1, 2019, respectively. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $1,471 and $1,434 at May 10, 2020, and September 1, 2019, respectively. These receivables generally settle within four days. Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. We no longer consider earnings after 2017 of our non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $4,619 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2020, compared to $4,063 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2019. Cash provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, payment terms with our suppliers, and the amount of early payments to obtain discounts from suppliers. 31 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,950 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2020, compared to $1,945 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2019, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. In the third quarter of 2020, we acquired Innovel and a minority interest in Navitus. For more information see Notes 1 and 2 in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Expenditure Plans Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first thirty-six weeks of 2020, we spent $1,958 on capital expenditures. While the impacts of COVID-19 have delayed certain of our construction projects, it is our current intention to spend between $2,700 and $2,900 during fiscal 2020. We opened six new warehouses, including one relocation, in the first thirty-six weeks of 2020 and plan to open 10 additional new warehouses, including two relocations, in the remainder of fiscal 2020. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized; plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $771 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2020, compared to cash used of $1,146 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2019. In April 2020, we issued $4,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes as follows: $1,250 of 1.375% due June 2027; $1,750 of 1.600% due April 2030; and $1,000 of 1.750% due April 2032. A portion of the proceeds were used to repay, prior to maturity, the 2.150% and 2.250% Senior Notes subsequent to the end of the quarter, at a redemption price plus accrued interest as specified in the Notes' agreements. The remaining funds will be used for general corporate purposes. Financing activities also included $1,200 and $500 repayment of our 1.700% and 1.750% Senior Notes, respectively, payment of dividends, and withholding taxes on stock-based awards. Stock Repurchase Programs During the first thirty-six weeks of 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 368,000 and 903,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $298.53 and $215.94, respectively, totaling approximately $110 and $195, respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Dividends Dividends totaling $860 were paid during the first thirty-six weeks of 2020, of which $286 related to the dividend declared in August 2019. On April 15, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share payable to shareholders of record on May 1, 2020. The dividend was paid subsequent to the end of the quarter on May 15, 2020. 32 Table of Contents Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At May 10, 2020, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $940, including a $400 revolving line of credit, which expires in June 2020. Our international operations maintain $427 of the borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $148 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities at the end of the third quarter of 2020 were immaterial and there were none outstanding at the end of 2019. The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $224. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the third quarter of 2020 totaled $150, most of which were standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. Contractual Obligations Other than the issuance of Senior Notes described above, as of the date of this Report, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since the end of our last fiscal year. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base these on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2019. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in that Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. Item 3—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our direct exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. There have been no material changes to our market risks as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2019. 33 Table of Contents Item 4—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of May 10, 2020, and based on their evaluation have concluded the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Although most of our corporate and regional office employees are working remotely due to COVID-19, we have not experienced a material impact to our internal control over financial reporting. We continue to monitor the pandemic and its effects on the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1—Legal Proceedings See discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. Item 1A—Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2019. Other than the risk factor set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Market and Other External Risks The COVID-19 outbreak is adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. The continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable, volatile, and uncertain and could adversely affect our business operations, demand for our products and services, costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things. 34 Table of Contents The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and on our employees, members, suppliers, and other people and entities with which we do business. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread, and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business and government shutdowns. Many government subdivisions have imposed restrictions on the operation of our membership warehouses, including limiting the number of members who may enter and preventing the sales of certain categories of merchandise. We are taking precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including temporarily requiring some employees to work remotely. To reward our employees for exemplary service in difficult times we have temporarily increased compensation levels and otherwise incurred increased spending for wages and benefits, including overtime pay. The outbreak and any preventative or protective actions that governments or we may take in respect of this virus are likely to result in a period of business disruption, reduced member traffic and reduced sales in certain merchandise categories, and increased operating expenses. The pandemic has significantly impacted the global supply chain, with restrictions and limitations on business activities causing disruption and delay. These disruptions and delays have strained domestic and international supply chains, which has affected and could continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain products. Member demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed, and member behaviors have changed, which has challenged our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. These factors have resulted in higher out-of-stock positions in certain products, as well as delays in delivering those products. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more or require us to incur higher transportation costs, adversely impacting our profitability and financial condition. Similarly, increased demand for online purchases of products has impacted our fulfillment operations, resulting in delays in delivering products to members. If we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if our members do not participate in social distancing and other safety measures, the well-being of our employees and members could be at risk, and a failure to appropriately respond, or the perception of an inadequate response, could cause reputational harm to our brand and subject us to claims from employees, members, suppliers, regulators or other parties. Additionally, a future outbreak of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our facilities could result in temporary or sustained workforce shortages or facility closures, which would negatively impact our business and results of operations. Some jurisdictions have taken measures intended to expand the availability of workers compensation or to change the presumptions applicable to workers compensation measures. These actions may increase our exposure to claims and increase our costs. In an effort to strengthen our liquidity position, during the quarter we issued $4 billion of long-term debt, a portion of which was used to repay, prior to maturity, $1.5 billion of Senior Notes subsequent to the end of the quarter. Financial and credit markets have experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility and turmoil. Our continued access to external sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. If the impacts of the pandemic continue to disrupt the financial markets, or if rating agencies lower our credit ratings, it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt or other sources of external liquidity, if needed. 35 Table of Contents Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: • The severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there is a “second wave” caused by additional periods of increases or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we operate; • Evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; • Unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response; • The pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides; and • The long-term impact of the pandemic on our business. To the extent that COVID-19 continues to adversely affect the U.S. and global economy, our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition, it may also heighten other risks described in the “Risk Factors” section in our 2019 Form 10-K, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, brand reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain and treat its impacts, among others.

(amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data) (unaudited) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. For the period ended February 16, 2020 , Costco operated 785 warehouses worldwide: 546 in the United States (U.S.) located in 44 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 100 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 26 in Japan, 16 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, 11 in Australia, two in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France and China. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material intercompany transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2019 . Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2020 is a 52-week year ending on August 30, 2020 . References to the second quarter of 2020 and 2019 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended February 16, 2020 , and February 17, 2019 , respectively. References to the first half of 2020 and 2019 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 16, 2020 , and February 17, 2019 , respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 9 Table of Contents Leases The Company leases land and/or buildings at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities. Leases generally contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair market value; or (c) a right of first refusal in the event of a third-party offer. Some leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. As the rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not easily determinable, the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated by using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02 - Leases (ASC 842), which required recognition on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by leases with terms greater than 12 months. The Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective transition method and elected to use the effective date of September 2, 2019, as the date of initial application. Consequently, the comparative periods presented continue to be in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, previously in effect. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, allowing the Company to carry forward conclusions related to: (a) whether expired or existing contracts contain leases; (b) lease classification; and (c) initial direct costs for existing leases. The Company has elected not to record operating lease right-of-use assets or lease liabilities associated with leases with durations of 12 months or less. Lastly, the Company elected the practical expedient allowing aggregation of non-lease components with related lease components when evaluating accounting treatment for all classes of underlying assets. Adoption of the new standard resulted in an initial increase to assets and liabilities of $ 2,632 related to recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease obligations as of September 2, 2019. Other line item impacts in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet were not material. The standard did not materially impact the condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flows. For more information on the Company's lease arrangements refer to Note 5 . 10 Table of Contents Note 2—Investments The Company's investments were as follows: February 16, 2020: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 523 $ 6 $ 529 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 400 400 Total short-term investments $ 923 $ 6 $ 929 September 1, 2019: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 716 $ 6 $ 722 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 338 338 Total short-term investments $ 1,054 $ 6 $ 1,060 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the periods ended February 16, 2020 , and September 1, 2019 .

In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. In September 2019, the Company received an assessment related to a product tax audit covering multiple years. The Company recorded the charge in fiscal 2019 and is protesting the assessment. No adjustments have been made to this estimate in the first half of 2020. Other possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. Note 9—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of basic and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000s): 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 16, 2020 February 17, 2019 February 16, 2020 February 17, 2019 Net income attributable to Costco $ 931 $ 889 $ 1,775 $ 1,656 Weighted average basic shares 442,021 440,284 441,920 439,721 RSUs 1,706 2,053 1,784 2,814 Weighted average diluted shares 443,727 442,337 443,704 442,535 Anti-dilutive RSUs — 1,667 — — Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. 17 Table of Contents The Company is a defendant in a class action alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to member service assistants who act as greeters in the Company’s California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (Case No. 5:13-CV-03598, N.D. Cal. filed July 1, 2013).

In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others concerning the impacts of opioid abuse. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are federal cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and class actions filed in thirty-eight states on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions. In 2019 similar actions were commenced against the Company in state courts in Utah and Arizona. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey and Oklahoma have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of these matters. 18 Table of Contents The Company and its CEO and CFO are defendants in putative class actions brought on behalf of shareholders who acquired Company stock between June 6 and October 25, 2018. Johnson v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash. filed Nov. 5, 2018); Chen v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash. filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaints allege violations of the federal securities laws stemming from the Company’s disclosures concerning internal control over financial reporting. They seek unspecified damages, equitable relief, interest, and costs and attorneys’ fees. On January 30, 2019, an order was entered consolidating the actions, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on April 16. On November 26, the court entered an order dismissing the consolidated amended complaint and granting the plaintiffs leave to file a further amended complaint within 90 days. Members of the Board of Directors, one other individual, and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to the internal controls and related disclosures identified in the putative class actions, alleging that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties. Wedekind v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (W.D. Wash. filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement of compensation, corporate governance changes, and costs and attorneys' fees. Because the complaint is derivative in nature, it does not seek monetary damages from the Company, which is a nominal defendant. By agreement among the parties the action has been stayed pending further proceedings in the class actions. Similar actions were filed in King County Superior Court on February 20, 2019, Elliott v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-04824-7), April 16, 2019, Brad Shuman, et ano. v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp.

Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-15514-1). These actions have also been stayed. In November 2016 and September 2017, the Company received notices of violation from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection regarding hazardous waste practices at its Connecticut warehouses, primarily concerning unsalable pharmaceuticals. The relief to be sought is not known at this time. The Company is seeking to cooperate concerning the resolution of these notices. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 19 Table of Contents Note 11—Segment Reporting The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which consider geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2019 , and Note 1 above. Intersegment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, are incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, but are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally come under the responsibility of the Company's U.S. management team.

OVERVIEW We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions (primarily impacting our U.S. and Canadian operations). The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and 21 Table of Contents gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods– consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results. We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse business. The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. 22 Table of Contents Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefits costs as a percentage of country sales, and less or no direct membership warehouse competition. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the second quarters of 2020 and 2019 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended February 16, 2020 , and February 17, 2019 , respectively. References to the first half of 2020 and 2019 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 16, 2020 , and February 17, 2019 , respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Highlights for the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the second quarter of 2019 include: • Net sales increased 10% to $38,256 , driven by an increase in comparable sales of 9% and sales at 16 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of 2019 ; • Membership fee revenue increased 6% to $816 , primarily due to sign-ups at existing and new warehouses; • Gross margin percentage decreased 31 basis points, primarily in our core merchandise categories driven by a shift in sales penetration to certain lower-margin warehouse ancillary and other businesses; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 22 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales and a shift in sales penetration to certain warehouse ancillary and other businesses with lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales; • Net income increased 5% to $931 , or $2.10 per diluted share, compared to $889 , or $2.01 per diluted share in 2019 ; and • On January 23, 2020 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.65 per share, which was paid on February 21, 2020 . 23 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 16, 2020 February 17, 2019 February 16, 2020 February 17, 2019 Net Sales $ 38,256 $ 34,628 $ 74,492 $ 68,939 Changes in net sales: U.S 10 % 9 % 8 % 11 % Canada 9 % 1 % 6 % 3 % Other International 12 % 4 % 9 % 6 % Total Company 10 % 7 % 8 % 9 % Changes in comparable sales: U.S 9 % 7 % 7 % 9 % Canada 9 % 0 % 6 % 1 % Other International 8 % 1 % 6 % 2 % Total Company 9 % 5 % 7 % 7 % Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency and gasoline prices (1) : U.S 8 % 7 % 7 % 8 % Canada 7 % 6 % 6 % 6 % Other International 7 % 5 % 6 % 5 % Total Company 8 % 7 % 6 % 7 % _______________ (1) Excludes the impact of the revenue recognition standard for the periods ended February 17, 2019 . Net Sales Net sales increased $3,628 or 10% , and $5,553 or 8% during the second quarter and first half of 2020 , respectively, compared to the second quarter and first half of 2019 . These increases were attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 9% and 7% in the second quarter and first half of 2020 , respectively, and sales at the 16 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of 2019 . During the second quarter of 2020 , changes in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $320 , or 92 basis points, due to a 9% increase in the average sales price per gallon. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar also positively impacted net sales by approximately $85 , or 25 basis points, compared to the second quarter of 2019 , attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. During the first half of 2020 , changes in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by approximately $198 , or 29 basis points, due to a 3% increase in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately 19 , or three basis points, compared to the first half of 2019 , attributable to our Other International operations. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 9% and 7% in the second quarter and first half of 2020 , respectively, and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket. Comparable sales were also positively impacted by the shift in timing of the Thanksgiving holiday to the second quarter of 2020. 24 Table of Contents Comparable sales for the second quarter and first half of 2020 were negatively impacted by cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Membership Fees 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 16, 2020 February 17, 2019 February 16, 2020 February 17, 2019 Membership fees $ 816 $ 768 $ 1,620 $ 1,526 Membership fees as a percentage of net sales 2.13 % 2.22 % 2.17 % 2.21 % Total paid members (000s) 55,300 52,700 — — Total cardholders (000s) 100,900 96,300 — — Membership fees increased 6% in both the second quarter and first half of 2020 . This was primarily due to signups at existing and new warehouses. At the end of the second quarter of 2020 , our member renewal rates were 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide. Gross Margin 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 16, 2020 February 17, 2019 February 16, 2020 February 17, 2019 Net sales $ 38,256 $ 34,628 $ 74,492 $ 68,939 Less merchandise costs 34,056 30,720 66,289 61,343 Gross margin $ 4,200 $ 3,908 $ 8,203 $ 7,596 Gross margin percentage 10.98 % 11.29 % 11.01 % 11.02 % Quarterly Results The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 15 basis points primarily in fresh foods and hardlines. The decrease in fresh foods was driven primarily by initial operating losses from our new poultry processing plant while hardlines decreased primarily due to timing of the Thanksgiving holiday, which shifted lower-margin activity into the current quarter as compared to the prior year second quarter. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in softlines. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Total gross margin percentage decreased 31 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.07%, a decrease of 22 basis points. This was primarily due to a shift in sales penetration to certain lower-margin warehouse ancillary businesses, and losses from our poultry processing plant discussed above. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased in our U.S. and Canadian operations, primarily due to decreases in our core merchandise categories. The segment gross margin percentage in our Other International operations increased, primarily in our core merchandise categories. 25 Table of Contents Year-to-date Results The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales, decreased six basis points. This was attributable to a decrease in fresh foods, which was driven primarily by initial operating losses from our new poultry processing plant, partially offset by an increase in softlines. Total gross margin percentage decreased one basis-point compared to the first half of 2019 . Excluding the impacts of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.04%, an increase of two basis points from the first half of 2019 . This was primarily due to a nine basis-point increase in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, as well as a six basis-point increase related to an adjustment in the first quarter of 2019 to our estimate of breakage on rewards earned under our co-branded credit card program. These increases were partially offset by a 14 basis-point decrease in our core merchandise categories, primarily due to losses from our poultry processing plant discussed above. The segment gross margin percentage decreased in our U.S. operations, primarily due to core merchandise categories, partially offset by our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, as well as the breakage adjustment noted above. The segment gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations increased due to increases in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses partially offset by decreases in certain of our core merchandise categories. The segment gross margin percentage in our Other International operations increased, primarily in our core merchandise categories. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 16, 2020 February 17, 2019 February 16, 2020 February 17, 2019 SG&A expenses $ 3,743 $ 3,464 $ 7,475 $ 6,939 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 9.78 % 10.00 % 10.03 % 10.06 % Quarterly Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 22 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, SG&A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.87%, a decrease of 13 basis points compared to the prior year. Costs related to warehouse operations and other businesses, which include e-commerce and travel, decreased 10 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales and a shift in sales penetration to certain warehouse ancillary and other businesses with lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. This decrease was partially offset by the wage increases and bonding leave benefits for U.S. and Canadian hourly employees effective in March 2019. Stock compensation expense was lower by three basis points. Year-to-date Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased three basis points compared to the first half of 2019 . Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, SG&A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales was flat despite the wage increases and bonding leave benefits for U.S. and Canadian hourly employees discussed above. Costs related to warehouse operations and other businesses, which include e-commerce and travel, were lower by two basis points, predominantly in our U.S. operations, due to leveraging increased sales. This decrease was offset by higher central operating costs of two basis points related to maintaining, upgrading and expanding our technology capabilities. 26 Table of Contents Preopening Expense 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 16, 2020 February 17, 2019 February 16, 2020 February 17, 2019 Preopening expenses $ 7 $ 9 $ 21 $ 31 Warehouse openings, including relocations United States 0 2 3 8 Canada 0 0 1 2 Other International 0 0 0 0 Total warehouse openings, including relocations 0 2 4 10 Preopening expenses include startup costs related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the openings relative to our quarter-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market. For the remainder of fiscal 2020 , we expect to open 15 warehouses, including two relocations.

Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $1,385 and $1,434 at February 16, 2020 , and September 1, 2019 , respectively. These receivables generally settle within four days. Cash and cash equivalents were positively impacted by foreign-exchange rate changes of $ 9 and negatively impacted by $ 13 in the first half of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. We no longer consider earnings after 2017 of our non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,721 in the first half of 2020 , compared to $1,958 in the first half of 2019 . Cash provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, payment terms with our suppliers, and the amount of early payments to obtain discounts from suppliers. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,100 in the first half of 2020 , compared to $1,171 in the first half of 2019 , and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. 28 Table of Contents Capital Expenditure Plans Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first half of 2020 , we spent $1,260 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $3,000 during fiscal 2020 . We opened four new warehouses, including one relocation, in the first half of 2020 and plan to open 15 additional new warehouses, including two relocations, in the remainder of fiscal 2020 . There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized; plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $2,228 in the first half of 2020 , compared to $749 in the first half of 2019 . Cash flow used in financing activities was primarily related to the $1,200 repayment of our 1.70% Senior Notes, payment of dividends, and withholding taxes on stock-based awards. Dividends totaling $573 were paid during the first half of 2020 , of which $286 related to the dividend declared in August 2019. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on February 18, 2020, the Company paid the outstanding principal balance of $500 and associated interest on the 1.75% Senior Notes using cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Stock Repurchase Programs During the first half of 2020 and 2019 , we repurchased 262,000 and 711,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $299.40 and $213.08 , respectively, totaling approximately $79 and $151 , respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Dividends On January 23, 2020 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share payable to shareholders of record on February 7, 2020 . The dividend was paid subsequent to the end of the quarter on February 21, 2020 . Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At February 16, 2020 , we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $875, including a $400 revolving line of credit, which expires in June 2020. Our international operations maintain $362 of the borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $146 is guaranteed by the Company. There were no outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of the second quarter of 2020 or at the end of 2019 . The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $225. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the second quarter of 2020 totaled $150, most of which were standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. 29 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations As of the date of this Report, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since the end of our last fiscal year.

Item 4—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of February 16, 2020 , and based on their evaluation have concluded the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

For the period ended November 24, 2019 , Costco operated 785 warehouses worldwide: 546 in the United States (U.S.) located in 44 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 100 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 26 in Japan, 16 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, 11 in Australia, two in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France and China. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material intercompany transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2019 . Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2020 is a 52-week year ending on August 30, 2020 . References to the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 24, 2019 , and November 25, 2018 , respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 8 Table of Contents Leases The Company leases land and/or buildings at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities. Leases generally contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair market value; or (c) a right of first refusal in the event of a third-party offer. Some leases include free rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company more likely than not expects to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company determines at inception of a contract whether the contract is or contains a lease. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. As the rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not easily determinable, the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated by using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 - Leases (ASC 842), which required recognition on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by leases with terms greater than 12 months. The Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective transition method and elected to use the effective date of September 2, 2019 as the date of initial application. Consequently, the comparative periods presented continue to be in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, allowing the Company to carry forward conclusions related to: (a) whether expired or existing contracts contain leases; (b) lease classification; and (c) initial direct costs for existing leases. The Company has elected not to record operating lease right-of-use assets or lease liabilities associated with leases with durations of 12 months or less. Lastly, the Company elected the practical expedient allowing aggregation of non-lease components with related lease components when evaluating accounting treatment for all classes of underlying assets. A doption of the new standard resulted in an initial increase to assets and liabilities of $ 2,632 related to recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease obligations as of September 2, 2019. Other line item impacts in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet were not material. The standard did not materially impact the condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flows. For more information on the Company's lease arrangements refer to Note 5 . 9 Table of Contents Note 2—Investments The Company's investments were as follows: November 24, 2019: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 596 $ 4 $ 600 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 393 393 Total short-term investments $ 989 $ 4 $ 993 September 1, 2019: Cost Basis Unrealized Gains, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 716 $ 6 $ 722 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 338 338 Total short-term investments $ 1,054 $ 6 $ 1,060 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the periods ended November 24, 2019 , and September 1, 2019 .

These awards are not included in the table below. The following table summarizes RSU transactions during the first quarter of 2020 : Number of Units (in 000s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at September 1, 2019 6,496 $ 167.55 Granted 2,128 293.62 Vested and delivered ( 3,341 ) 188.91 Forfeited ( 26 ) 182.38 Outstanding at November 24, 2019 5,257 $ 204.94 The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSUs at November 24, 2019 , was $ 1,012 , and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.8 years. Summary of Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits: 12 Weeks Ended November 24, 2019 November 25, 2018 Stock-based compensation expense before income taxes $ 301 $ 270 Less recognized income tax benefit ( 66 ) ( 61 ) Stock-based compensation expense, net of income taxes $ 235 $ 209 15 Table of Contents Note 8—Taxes Other Taxes The Company is undergoing multiple examinations for value-added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. In September 2019, the Company received an assessment related to a product tax audit covering multiple years. The Company recorded the charge in fiscal 2019 and is protesting the assessment. Other possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. Note 9—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of basic and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000s): 12 Weeks Ended November 24, 2019 November 25, 2018 Net income attributable to Costco $ 844 $ 767 Weighted average basic shares 441,818 439,157 RSUs 1,862 3,592 Weighted average diluted shares 443,680 442,749 Note 10-Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. 16 Table of Contents The Company is a defendant in a class action alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to member service assistants who act as greeters in the Company’s California warehouses.

In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others concerning the impacts of opioid abuse. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are federal cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and class actions filed in thirty-eight states on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions. In 2019 similar actions were commenced against the Company in state courts in Utah and Arizona. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey and Oklahoma have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of these matters. 17 Table of Contents The Company and its CEO and CFO are defendants in putative class actions brought on behalf of shareholders who acquired Company stock between June 6 and October 25, 2018. Johnson v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash. filed Nov. 5, 2018); Chen v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash. filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaints allege violations of the federal securities laws stemming from the Company’s disclosures concerning internal control over financial reporting. They seek unspecified damages, equitable relief, interest, and costs and attorneys’ fees. On January 30, 2019, an order was entered consolidating the actions, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on April 16. On November 26, the court entered an order dismissing the consolidated amended complaint and granting the plaintiffs leave to file a further amended complaint within 90 days. Members of the Board of Directors, one other individual, and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to the internal controls and related disclosures identified in the putative class actions, alleging that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties. Wedekind v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (W.D. Wash. filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement of compensation, corporate governance changes, and costs and attorneys' fees. Because the complaint is derivative in nature, it does not seek monetary damages from the Company, which is a nominal defendant. By agreement among the parties the action has been stayed pending further proceedings in the class actions. Similar actions were filed in King County Superior Court on February 20, 2019, Elliott v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp.

Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-10460-1), and June 12, 2019, Rahul Modi v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-15514-1). These actions have also been stayed. In November 2016 and September 2017, the Company received notices of violation from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection regarding hazardous waste practices at its Connecticut warehouses, primarily concerning unsalable pharmaceuticals. The relief to be sought is not known at this time. The Company is seeking to cooperate concerning the resolution of these notices. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. 18 Table of Contents Note 11—Segment Reporting The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which consider geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2019 , and Note 1 above. Intersegment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, are incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, but are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally come under the responsibility of the Company's U.S. management team. The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments: United States Operations Canadian Operations Other International Operations Total 12 Weeks Ended November 24, 2019 Total revenue $ 27,065 $ 5,127 $ 4,848 $ 37,040 Operating income 635 228 198 1,061 Total assets 35,784 4,857 10,790 51,431 12 Weeks Ended November 25, 2018 Total revenue $ 25,550 $ 4,977 $ 4,542 $ 35,069 Operating income 560 214 175 949 Total assets 30,499 4,673 8,642 43,814 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2019 Total revenue $ 111,751 $ 21,366 $ 19,586 $ 152,703 Operating income 3,063 924 750 4,737 Total assets 32,162 4,369 8,869 45,400 Disaggregated Revenue The following table summarizes net sales by merchandise category: 12 Weeks Ended November 24, 2019 November 25, 2018 Foods and Sundries $ 14,532 $ 13,641 Hardlines 5,843 5,840 Fresh Foods 4,576 4,293 Softlines 4,297 4,123 Ancillary 6,988 6,414 Total Net Sales $ 36,236 $ 34,311 19 Table of Contents Item 2—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, and warehouse count data) FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained in this Report constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

OVERVIEW We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth. We define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions (primarily impacting our U.S. and Canadian operations). The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, 20 Table of Contents national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods– consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results. We also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse business. The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. 21 Table of Contents Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefits costs as a percentage of country sales, and/or less or no direct membership warehouse competition. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended November 24, 2019 , and November 25, 2018 , respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Highlights for the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the first quarter of 2019 include: • Net sales increased 6% to $36,236 , driven by an increase in comparable sales of 4% and sales at 17 net new warehouses opened since the end of the first quarter of 2019 ; • Membership fee revenue increased 6% to $804 , primarily due to sign-ups at existing and new warehouses; • Gross margin percentage increased 30 basis points, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and an adjustment in the first quarter of 2019 to our estimate of breakage on rewards earned under our co-branded credit card program; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 17 basis points, primarily due to operating costs related to warehouse, ancillary and other businesses and stock compensation; • The provision for income taxes in the first quarter of 2020 was positively impacted by a benefit related to stock compensation of $77, or $0.17 per diluted share compared to $59, or $0.13 in the first quarter of 2019. The first quarter of 2019 was also positively impacted by a benefit of $27, or $0.06 per diluted share, related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act); • Net income increased 10% to $844 , or $1.90 per diluted share, compared to $767 , or $1.73 per diluted share in 2019 ; and • On October 18, 2019 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.65 per share, which was paid on November 15, 2019 . 22 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 12 Weeks Ended November 24, 2019 November 25, 2018 Net Sales $ 36,236 $ 34,311 Changes in net sales U.S 6 % 12 % Canada 3 % 4 % Other International 7 % 8 % Total Company 6 % 10 % Changes in comparable sales: U.S 5 % 11 % Canada 3 % 2 % Other International 3 % 4 % Total Company 4 % 9 % Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency and gasoline prices (1) : U.S 5 % 8 % Canada 5 % 5 % Other International 4 % 6 % Total Company 5 % 7 % _______________ (1) Excludes the impact of the revenue recognition standard for the period ended November 25, 2018 . Net Sales Net sales increased $1,925 or 6% , during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019 . This increase was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 4% in the first quarter of 2020 , and sales at the 17 net new warehouses opened since the end of the first quarter of 2019 . During the first quarter of 2020 , changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $122 , or 35 basis points, due to a 3% decrease in the average sales price per gallon. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar also negatively impacted net sales by approximately $103 , or 30 basis points, compared to the first quarter of 2019 , attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 4% in the first quarter of 2020 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket. Comparable sales for the first quarter of 2020 were negatively impacted by cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations) and the shift in timing of the Thanksgiving holiday to the second quarter of 2020. 23 Table of Contents Membership Fees 12 Weeks Ended November 24, 2019 November 25, 2018 Membership fees $ 804 $ 758 Membership fees as a percentage of net sales 2.22 % 2.21 % Total paid members as of quarter end (000s) 54,700 52,200 Total cardholders as of quarter end (000s) 99,900 95,400 The increase of 6% in membership fees was primarily due to signups at existing and new warehouses. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a slight negative impact on membership fees. At the end of the first quarter of 2020 , our member renewal rates were 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide. Gross Margin 12 Weeks Ended November 24, 2019 November 25, 2018 Net sales $ 36,236 $ 34,311 Less merchandise costs 32,233 30,623 Gross margin $ 4,003 $ 3,688 Gross margin percentage 11.05 % 10.75 % The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased four basis points, primarily due to increases in hardlines, softlines, and food and sundries partially offset by a decrease in fresh foods, which was driven primarily by initial operating losses from our new poultry processing plant. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Total gross margin percentage increased 30 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.01%, an increase of 26 basis points. This was primarily due to a 19 basis-point increase in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and 13 basis points related to an adjustment in the first quarter of 2019 to our estimate of breakage on rewards earned under our co-branded credit card program. These increases were partially offset by a six basis-point decrease in our core merchandise categories. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased in our U.S. operations, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and the adjustment mentioned above, partially offset by decreases in our core merchandise categories. The segment gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The segment gross margin percentage in our Other International operations increased, primarily due to our core merchandise categories and our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, partially offset by increased spending by members under the Executive Membership 2% reward program. 24 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 12 Weeks Ended November 24, 2019 November 25, 2018 SG&A expenses $ 3,732 $ 3,475 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 10.30 % 10.13 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 17 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, SG&A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.26%, an increase of 13 basis points compared to the prior year. Operating costs related to warehouse ancillary and other businesses, which include e-commerce and travel, increased five basis points, primarily due to the wage increases and bonding leave benefits for U.S. and Canadian hourly employees effective in March 2019. Stock compensation was higher by four basis points, primarily due to accelerated vesting for long service. Central operating costs related to maintaining, upgrading and expanding our technology capabilities were higher by four basis points. Preopening Expense 12 Weeks Ended November 24, 2019 November 25, 2018 Preopening expenses $ 14 $ 22 Warehouse openings, including relocations United States 3 6 Canada 1 2 Other International 0 0 Total warehouse openings, including relocations 4 8 Preopening expenses include startup costs related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the openings relative to our quarter-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market. For the remainder of fiscal 2020 , we expect to open 17 warehouses, including two relocations. Interest Expense 12 Weeks Ended November 24, 2019 November 25, 2018 Interest expense $ 38 $ 36 Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes. 25 Table of Contents Interest Income and Other, Net 12 Weeks Ended November 24, 2019 November 25, 2018 Interest income $ 32 $ 21 Foreign-currency transaction gains, net (4 ) (5 ) Other, net 7 6 Interest income and other, net $ 35 $ 22 Interest income increased for the first quarter of 2020 , due to higher average cash and investment balances and higher interest rates.

See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Item 8, Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2019 . Provision for Income Taxes 12 Weeks Ended November 24, 2019 November 25, 2018 Provision for income taxes $ 202 $ 158 Effective tax rate 19.1 % 16.9 % The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was favorably impacted by $77 due to excess tax benefits from stock compensation. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was favorably impacted by discrete tax benefits of $59 related to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and $27 related to the 2017 Tax Act. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 12 Weeks Ended November 24, 2019 November 25, 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,102 $ 2,177 Net cash used in investing activities (630 ) (737 ) Net cash used in financing activities (836 ) (700 ) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $10,020 and $9,444 at November 24, 2019 , and September 1, 2019 , respectively. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $1,743 and $1,434 at November 24, 2019 , and September 1, 2019 , respectively. These receivables generally settle within four days. Cash and cash equivalents were positively impacted by a change in exchange rates of $ 7 and negatively impacted by a change of $ 17 in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. We no longer consider earnings after 2017 of our non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. 26 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,102 in the first quarter of 2020 , compared to $2,177 in the first quarter of 2019 . Cash provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, payment terms with our suppliers, the amount of early payments to obtain discounts from suppliers, and the shift in timing of the Thanksgiving holiday to the second quarter of 2020. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $630 in the first quarter of 2020 , compared to $737 in the first quarter of 2019 , and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Expenditure Plans Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In the first quarter of 2020 , we spent $715 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $3,000 during fiscal 2020 . We opened four new warehouses, including one relocation, in the first quarter of 2020 and plan to open 17 additional new warehouses, including two relocations, in the remainder of fiscal 2020 . There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized; plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $836 in the first quarter of 2020 , compared to $700 in the first quarter of 2019 . Cash flow used in financing activities was primarily related to the payment of dividends, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, and repurchases of common stock. Dividends totaling $573 were paid during the first quarter of 2020 , of which $286 related to the dividend declared in August 2019. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on December 16, 2019, we paid the outstanding principal balance and associated interest on the 1.70% Senior Notes from cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Stock Repurchase Programs During the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 , we repurchased 100,000 and 150,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $295.97 and $229.35 , respectively, totaling approximately $30 and $34 , respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Dividends On October 18, 2019 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share payable to shareholders of record on November 1, 2019 . The dividend was paid on November 15, 2019 . 27 Table of Contents Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At November 24, 2019 , we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $873, including a $400 revolving line of credit, which expires in June 2020. Our international operations maintain $360 of the borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $147 is guaranteed by the Company. There were no outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of the first quarter of 2020 or at the end of 2019 . The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $224. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the first quarter of 2020 totaled $150, most of which were standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. Contractual Obligations As of the date of this Report, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since the end of our last fiscal year. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base these on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2019 . There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in that Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. Item 3—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our direct exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. There have been no material changes to our market risks as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2019 . Item 4—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 24, 2019 , and based on their evaluation have concluded the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. 28 Table of Contents Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In the first quarter of 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-02 Leases (ASC 842) which required changes to certain of our business processes and internal controls over financial reporting. There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data) (unaudited) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. For the period ended May 12, 2019 , Costco operated 772 warehouses worldwide: 535 in the United States (U.S.) located in 44 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 100 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 28 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 26 in Japan, 16 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, 11 in Australia, two in Spain, and one each in Iceland and France. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, and Taiwan. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. During the first quarter of 2018 , the Company purchased its former joint venture partner's remaining equity interest in its Korean operations. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018 . Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2019 is a 52 week year ending on September 1, 2019 . References to the third quarter of 2019 and 2018 relate to the 12 week fiscal quarters ended May 12, 2019 , and May 13, 2018 , respectively. References to the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 and 2018 relate to the 36 weeks ended May 12, 2019 , and May 13, 2018 , respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 9 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and returns. The Company reserves for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Merchandise Sales - The Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods. The Company also provides expanded products and services through warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The majority of revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is recognized upon shipment to the member to the extent there is no installation provided as a part of the contract. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the condensed consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Principal Versus Agent - The Company is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally is established when Costco is primarily responsible for merchandising decisions, maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member service and satisfaction, and has pricing discretion. Membership Fees - The Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. For the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 , the Company recognized $2,302 of membership fees, of which $1,451 was included in deferred membership at the end of 2018 . In certain countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum of approximately $1,000 per year), which does not expire and can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. In the third quarter of 2019 and 2018 the net reduction in sales was $346 and $316 , respectively. In the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 and 2018 the net reduction in sales was $1,060 and $962 , respectively. Cash Cards - The Company sells and otherwise provides proprietary cash cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from cash cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for outstanding cash card balances as a cash card liability, net of estimated breakage and as of May 12, 2019 , and September 2, 2018, the liability was not material. Co-Branded Credit Card Program - Citibank, N.A. (“Citi”) became the exclusive issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members in June 2016. The Company receives various forms of consideration, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco, a portion of which, after giving rise to estimated breakage, is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receive. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31 of each year. Breakage is estimated based on redemption data. 10 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, providing for changes in the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance requires disclosures sufficient to describe the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows. The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $16 as an increase to retained earnings, which is included in cash dividend declared and other in the condensed consolidated statements of equity. The standard impacted the presentation and timing of certain revenue transactions. Specifically, the changes included gross presentation of the Company’s estimate of merchandise returns reserve and the related recoverable assets, recognizing cash card breakage over the period of redemption, and accelerating the recognition of certain e-commerce and special-order sales. Additionally, the Company’s evaluation under the standard of its status as a principal in certain vendor arrangements resulted in the recognition of additional sales on a gross basis. The effect of the standard on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet was an increase to other current liabilities and other current assets of $649 and $694 at adoption and at the end of the third quarter of 2019, respectively, related to the estimate of merchandise returns reserve and the related recoverable assets. The effect of the adoption of this standard on the Company's condensed consolidated statement of income is as follows: As Reported ASU 2014-09 Effect Excluding ASU 2014-09 Effect 12 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 Net Sales $ 33,964 $ 346 $ 33,618 Merchandise Costs 30,233 342 29,891 Gross Margin (1) 3,731 4 3,727 36 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 Net Sales $ 102,903 $ 865 $ 102,038 Merchandise Costs 91,576 856 90,720 Gross Margin (1) 11,327 9 11,318 _______________ (1) Net sales less merchandise costs. For related disaggregated revenue disclosures, see Note 10 . Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires recognition on the balance sheet of rights and obligations created by leases with terms greater than twelve months. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2020 and utilize the transition option, which allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption and does not require application of the guidance to comparative periods. The primary effect of adoption will be recording right-of-use assets and corresponding lease obligations for current operating leases. Although the Company continues to evaluate the effect to the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures, management currently estimates total assets and liabilities will increase by approximately $2,500 to $ 3,000 upon adoption. This estimate could change as the Company continues to progress with implementation and will also fluctuate based on the lease portfolio, discount rates and currency exchange 11 Table of Contents rates as of the adoption date. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact to the Company's consolidated statements of income or cash flows. The Company is reviewing current accounting policies and related disclosures, and evaluating changes to business processes, systems and controls to support adoption of the new standard, which includes implementing a new lease accounting system. Note 2—Investments The Company's investments were as follows: May 12, 2019: Cost Basis Unrealized Loss, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 860 $ (3 ) $ 857 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 297 297 Total short-term investments $ 1,157 $ (3 ) $ 1,154 September 2, 2018: Cost Basis Unrealized Loss, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 912 $ (14 ) $ 898 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 306 306 Total short-term investments $ 1,218 $ (14 ) $ 1,204 Gross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the periods ended May 12, 2019 , and September 2, 2018 .

There were no transfers in or out of Level 1 or 2 during the third quarter or the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 or 2018 . Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets recorded at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. There were no fair value adjustments to these items during the third quarter or first thirty-six weeks of 2019 and 2018 . 13 Table of Contents Note 4—Debt The carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt consisted of the following: May 12, 2019 September 2, 2018 1.70% Senior Notes due December 2019 $ 1,200 $ 1,200 1.75% Senior Notes due February 2020 500 500 2.15% Senior Notes due May 2021 1,000 1,000 2.25% Senior Notes due February 2022 500 500 2.30% Senior Notes due May 2022 800 800 2.75% Senior Notes due May 2024 1,000 1,000 3.00% Senior Notes due May 2027 1,000 1,000 Other long-term debt 529 613 Total long-term debt 6,529 6,613 Less unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 31 36 Less current portion 1,699 90 Long-term debt, excluding current portion $ 4,799 $ 6,487 The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.

The fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $6,519 and $6,492 at May 12, 2019 , and September 2, 2018 , respectively. Note 5—Equity Dividends The Company’s current quarterly dividend rate is $0.65 per share, compared to $0.57 in the third quarter of 2018 . On April 26, 2019 , the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.65 per share, which was paid on May 24, 2019 . Stock Repurchase Programs Stock repurchase activity during the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2019 and 2018 is summarized below: Shares Repurchased (000's) Average Price per Share Total Cost Third quarter of 2019 192 $ 226.57 $ 44 First thirty-six weeks 2019 903 $ 215.94 $ 195 Third quarter of 2018 290 $ 189.66 $ 55 First thirty-six weeks 2018 1,337 $ 174.30 $ 233 These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. On April 26, 2019 , the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000 , which expires in April 2023 . This authorization revoked previously authorized but unused amounts, totaling $2,237 . The remaining amount available for stock repurchases under the approved plan was $3,995 at May 12, 14 Table of Contents 2019 . Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Note 6—Stock-Based Compensation On January 24, 2019, our shareholders approved the adoption of the 2019 Incentive Plan, which replaced the Seventh Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (Seventh Plan). The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares ( 10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant under the Seventh Plan on January 24, 2019 and future forfeited shares from grants under the Seventh Plan up to a maximum aggregate of 27,800,000 shares ( 15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes. Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity At May 12, 2019 , 15,649,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs and the following awards were outstanding: • 6,307,000 time-based RSUs that vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time; • 78,000 performance-based RSUs, granted to executive officers of the Company, for which the performance targets have been met. The awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time; and • 150,000 performance-based RSUs, granted to executive officers of the Company, subject to achievement of performance targets for fiscal 2019 , as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors after the end of the fiscal year. These awards are included in the table below and the Company recognized compensation expense for these awards as it is currently deemed probable that the targets will be achieved. The following table summarizes RSU transactions during the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 : Number of Units (in 000’s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at September 2, 2018 7,578 $ 140.85 Granted 2,792 224.00 Vested and delivered (3,707 ) 155.64 Forfeited (128 ) 163.68 Outstanding at May 12, 2019 6,535 $ 167.55 The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at May 12, 2019 , was $ 817 , and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.7 years. Summary of Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits under the Company’s plans: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 Stock-based compensation expense before income taxes $ 93 $ 85 $ 482 $ 431 Less recognized income tax benefit (20 ) (19 ) (104 ) (98 ) Stock-based compensation expense, net of income taxes $ 73 $ 66 $ 378 $ 333 15 Table of Contents Note 7—Taxes Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2019 was favorably impacted by the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% , which was in effect for the entire third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2019, as compared to a higher blended rate effective for the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2018. The effective tax rate for the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 included discrete net tax benefits of $165 . During the third quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a net benefit of $73 related to U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends, net of losses of current year foreign tax credits, which impacted the effective tax rate. The tax rate for the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 was 26.8% , excluding the discrete benefits, but including the impact of the lost foreign tax credits. Other Taxes The Company is undergoing multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, import or other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. The possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. Note 8—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000’s): 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 Net income attributable to Costco $ 906 $ 750 $ 2,562 $ 2,091 Weighted average number of common shares used in basic net income per common share 439,859 438,740 439,767 438,576 RSUs 2,783 2,975 2,798 2,807 Weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential of common stock used in diluted net income per share 442,642 441,715 442,565 441,383 16 Table of Contents Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in a class action alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to member service assistants who act as greeters in the Company’s California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (Case No. 5:13-CV-03598, N.D. Cal. filed July 1, 2013). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. The action in the district court has been stayed pending review by the Ninth Circuit of the order certifying a class. In January 2019, an employee brought similar claims for relief concerning Costco employees engaged at member services counters in California. Rodriguez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. RG19001310, Alameda Superior Court filed Jan. 4, 2019). In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that employees in California did not receive suitable seating or appropriate workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Dec. 6, 2018 Notice to California Labor and Workforce Development Agency). In January 2019, a former seasonal employee filed a class action, alleging failure to provide California seasonal employees meal and rest breaks, proper wage statements, and appropriate wages. Jadan v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-CV-340438 Santa Clara Superior Court filed Jan. 3, 2019). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. On March 25, 2019, employees filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez, et ano., v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al . (Case No. 19ST-CV-10017 Los Angeles County Superior Court filed Mar. 25, 2019). In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, and third-party payors concerning the impacts of opioid abuse. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are federal cases that name the Company, including actions filed by a number of counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, a third-party payor in Ohio, and class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in New York, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, and Missouri. Similar claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey and Oklahoma have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of these matters. The Company and its CEO and CFO are defendants in putative class actions brought on behalf of shareholders who acquired Company stock between June 6 and October 25, 2018. Johnson v. Costco 17 Table of Contents Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash. filed Nov. 5, 2018); Chen v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash. filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaints allege violations of the federal securities laws stemming from the Company’s disclosures concerning internal control over financial reporting. They seek unspecified damages, equitable relief, interest, and costs and attorneys’ fees. On January 30, 2019, an order was entered consolidating the actions and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on April 16, 2019. The Company expects the consolidated action to be vigorously defended. Members of the Board of Directors, one other individual, and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to the internal controls and related disclosures identified in the putative class actions, alleging that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties. Wedekind v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (W.D. Wash. filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement of compensation, corporate governance changes, and costs and attorneys' fees. Because the complaint is derivative in nature, it does not seek monetary damages from the Company, which is a nominal defendant. By agreement among the parties the action has been stayed pending further proceedings in the class actions. Similar actions were filed in King County Superior Court on February 20, 2019, Elliott v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-04824-7), and April 16, 2019, Brad Shuman, et ano. v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-10460-1). These actions have also been stayed. In November 2016 and September 2017, the Company received notices of violation from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection regarding hazardous waste practices at its Connecticut warehouses, primarily concerning unsalable pharmaceuticals. On February 13, 2019, the Company's affiliate in Spain received notice from the General Directorate on Environment and Sustainability of the Regional Government of Madrid that the Directorate is investigating issues concerning rain, sewage and hydrocarbon drainage related to the Company's warehouse in Getafe. The relief to be sought is not known at this time. The Company is seeking to cooperate concerning the resolution of these notices. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. Note 10—Segment Reporting The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland and France and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which consider geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018 , and Note 1 above. Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, are incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International Operations, but are included in the U.S. Operations because those costs generally come under the responsibility of the Company's U.S. management team. 18 Table of Contents The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments: United States Operations Canadian Operations Other International Operations Total 12 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 Total revenue $ 25,536 $ 4,792 $ 4,412 $ 34,740 Operating income 736 213 173 1,122 Depreciation and amortization 260 32 44 336 Additions to property and equipment 500 38 134 672 12 Weeks Ended May 13, 2018 Total revenue $ 23,475 $ 4,647 $ 4,239 $ 32,361 Operating income 682 210 175 1,067 Depreciation and amortization 242 31 54 327 Additions to property and equipment 468 42 75 585 36 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 Total revenue $ 76,958 $ 14,561 $ 13,686 $ 105,205 Operating income 2,108 625 541 3,274 Depreciation and amortization 764 100 155 1,019 Additions to property and equipment 1,428 209 352 1,989 Net property and equipment 14,020 1,917 4,538 20,475 Total assets 30,416 4,637 8,699 43,752 36 Weeks Ended May 13, 2018 Total revenue $ 69,975 $ 14,163 $ 13,027 $ 97,165 Operating income 1,818 652 564 3,034 Depreciation and amortization 756 94 156 1,006 Additions to property and equipment 1,323 156 434 1,913 Net property and equipment 12,924 1,829 4,425 19,178 Total assets 27,062 4,248 8,295 39,605 52 Weeks Ended September 2, 2018 Total revenue $ 102,286 $ 20,689 $ 18,601 $ 141,576 Operating income 2,787 939 754 4,480 Depreciation and amortization 1,078 135 224 1,437 Additions to property and equipment 2,046 268 655 2,969 Net property and equipment 13,353 1,900 4,428 19,681 Total assets 28,207 4,303 8,320 40,830 Disaggregated Revenue The following table summarizes net sales by merchandise category: 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 May 12, 2019 Foods and Sundries $ 13,524 $ 41,131 Hardlines 5,666 17,276 Fresh Foods 4,568 13,551 Softlines 3,413 11,760 Ancillary 6,793 19,185 Total Net Sales $ 33,964 $ 102,903 19 Table of Contents Item 2—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, and warehouse count data) FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained in this Report constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

OVERVIEW We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth. We define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, as well as online sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions; and changes from the revenue recognition standard. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and 20 Table of Contents regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items and through our online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods– consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing can, from time to time, include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, negatively impacting near-term gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe that our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a significantly lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline businesses. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results. We also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales. Our membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. 21 Table of Contents Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 10 included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefits costs as a percentage of country sales, and/or less or no direct membership warehouse competition. In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which relates to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the third quarters of 2019 and 2018 relate to the 12 week fiscal quarters ended May 12, 2019 , and May 13, 2018 , respectively. References to the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 and 2018 relate to the 36 weeks ended May 12, 2019 , and May 13, 2018 , respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Key items for the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the third quarter of 2018 include: • Net sales increased 7% to $33,964 , driven by an increase in comparable sales of 6% and sales at 23 net new warehouses opened since the end of the third quarter of 2018 ; • Membership fee revenue increased 5% to $776 , primarily due to sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and the annual fee increase in the U.S. and Canada in June 2017; • Gross margin percentage decreased six basis points primarily due to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard on net sales; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased six basis points primarily due to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard on net sales; • The provision for income taxes in the third quarter of 2019 was positively impacted by a non-recurring tax benefit of $73 , or $0.16 per diluted share; • Net income increased 21% to $906 , or $2.05 per diluted share, compared to $750 , or $1.70 per diluted share in 2018 ; • On April 26, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash-dividend of $0.65 per share, an increase from $0.57, which was paid on May 24, 2019; and • On April 26, 2019 , the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000 . 22 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 Net Sales $ 33,964 $ 31,624 $ 102,903 $ 95,020 Changes in net sales U.S 9 % 11 % 10 % 11 % Canada 3 % 14 % 3 % 14 % Other international 4 % 17 % 5 % 18 % Total Company 7 % 12 % 8 % 12 % Changes in comparable sales: U.S 7 % 10 % 9 % 9 % Canada 1 % 11 % 1 % 10 % Other international 2 % 12 % 2 % 13 % Total Company 6 % 10 % 7 % 10 % Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency and gasoline prices (1) : U.S 6 % 8 % 7 % 7 % Canada 5 % 5 % 6 % 4 % Other international 7 % 6 % 6 % 7 % Total Company 6 % 7 % 7 % 7 % _______________ (1) Excludes the impact of the revenue recognition standard for the periods ended May 12, 2019 . See Item 1 Note 1 . Net Sales Net sales increased $2,340 or 7% , and $7,883 or 8% during the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2019 , respectively, compared to the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2018 . These increases were attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 6% and 7% in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2019 , respectively, and sales at the 23 net new warehouses opened since the end of the third quarter of 2018 . During the third quarter of 2019, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $427 , or 135 basis points, compared to the third quarter of 2018 , attributable to our Other International and Canadian operations. The new revenue recognition standard positively impacted net sales by $ 346 , or 110 basis points. Gasoline prices had a slight positive impact on net sales. During the first thirty-six weeks of 2019, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $1,199 , or 126 basis points, compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2018 , attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. The new revenue recognition standard positively impacted net sales by $ 865 , or 91 basis points. Changes in gasoline prices also positively impacted net sales by approximately $240 , or 25 basis points, due to a 2% increase in the average price per gallon. 23 Table of Contents Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 6% and 7% in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2019 , respectively, and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket. Comparable sales for the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2019 were negatively impacted by cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Membership Fees 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 Membership fees $ 776 $ 737 $ 2,302 $ 2,145 Membership fees as a percentage of net sales 2.29 % 2.33 % 2.24 % 2.26 % Total paid members as of quarter end (000's) 53,100 50,900 — — Total cardholders as of quarter end (000's) 97,200 93,000 — — Membership fees increased 5% and 7% in the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2019 , respectively. This was primarily due to sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and the fee increase (discussed below). Renewal rates are 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide. As previously reported, in fiscal 2017 we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. These fee increases had a positive impact on revenues during the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2019 of approximately $ 11 and $ 72 , respectively. Gross Margin 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 Net sales $ 33,964 $ 31,624 $ 102,903 $ 95,020 Less merchandise costs 30,233 28,131 91,576 84,481 Gross margin $ 3,731 $ 3,493 $ 11,327 $ 10,539 Gross margin percentage 10.99 % 11.05 % 11.01 % 11.09 % Quarterly Results The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 21 basis points, with increases in all core merchandise categories. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Total gross margin percentage decreased six basis points compared to the third quarter of 2018 . Excluding the impacts of the new revenue recognition standard and gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.10%, an increase of five basis points. This was primarily due to a nine basis point increase across most core merchandise categories, partially offset by the Executive Membership 2% reward program, which negatively impacted gross margin by three basis points, due to increased spending by Executive Members. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses decreased by one basis point. Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased in our 24 Table of Contents U.S. operations, primarily due to warehouse ancillary and other businesses, partially offset by increases in our core merchandise categories. The segment gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations decreased, primarily due to our core merchandise categories. The segment gross margin percentage in our Other International operations decreased, primarily due to the Executive Membership 2% reward program which was recently introduced in Korea, and our core merchandise categories. Year-to-date Results The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales, increased eight basis points. This was attributable to increases in food and sundries and hardlines partially offset by decreases in softlines. Total gross margin percentage decreased eight basis points compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2018 . Excluding the impacts of gasoline price inflation and the new revenue recognition standard on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.13%, an increase of four basis points from the first thirty-six weeks of 2018 . This was primarily due to a 15 basis point increase in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly our gasoline business. This increase was partially offset by decreases of four basis points in our core merchandise categories and four basis points due to an adjustment to our estimate of breakage on rewards earned under our co-branded credit card program. Executive Membership 2% reward program negatively impacted gross margin by three basis points, due to increased spending by Executive Members. The segment gross margin percentage increased in our U.S. operations, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly our gasoline business, partially offset by our core merchandise categories. The segment gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations decreased due to decreases across all core merchandise categories, except fresh foods, and warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The segment gross margin percentage in our Other International operations decreased, primarily in our core merchandise categories. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 SG&A expenses $ 3,371 $ 3,155 $ 10,310 $ 9,613 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 9.92 % 9.98 % 10.02 % 10.12 % Quarterly Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased six basis points compared to the third quarter of 2018 . Excluding the impacts of the new revenue recognition standard and gasoline price inflation on net sales, SG&A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.03%, an increase of five basis points compared to the prior year. Operating costs related to warehouse, ancillary and other businesses, which includes e-commerce and travel, increased two basis points, primarily due to the wage increases of our U.S. hourly employees that went into effect in June 2018. Central operating costs were higher by two basis points and stock compensation expense was higher by one basis point. Year-to-date Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points compared to the first thirty-six weeks of 2018 . Excluding the impacts of gasoline price inflation and the new revenue recognition standard on net sales, SG&A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.13%, an increase of one basis point. Stock compensation expense was higher by two basis points and operating costs related to warehouse, ancillary and other businesses, which includes e-commerce and travel, were lower by one basis point. 25 Table of Contents Preopening Expense 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 Preopening expenses $ 14 $ 8 $ 45 $ 37 Warehouse openings, including relocations United States 1 0 9 7 Canada 0 0 2 1 Other International 2 2 2 2 Total warehouse openings, including relocations 3 2 13 10 Preopening expenses include startup costs related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the openings relative to our quarter-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market. For the remainder of fiscal 2019 , we expect to open 13 warehouses, including two relocations. Interest Expense 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 Interest expense $ 35 $ 37 $ 105 $ 111 Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes. In October 2018 we repaid a Guaranteed Senior Note issued by our Japanese subsidiary. Interest Income and Other, Net 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 Interest income $ 27 $ 16 $ 81 $ 45 Foreign-currency transaction gains, net 3 20 6 10 Other, net 6 5 17 15 Interest income and other, net $ 36 $ 41 $ 104 $ 70 Interest income increased for the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2019 , due to higher interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances. Foreign-currency transaction gains, net, include the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations and mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts. See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Item 8, Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018 . 26 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes 12 Weeks Ended 36 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 Provision for income taxes $ 207 $ 309 $ 679 $ 867 Effective tax rate 18.5 % 28.8 % 20.7 % 29.0 % The effective tax rate for the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2019 was favorably impacted by the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which was in effect for the entire third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2019, as compared to a higher blended rate effective for the third quarter and first thirty-six weeks of 2018. The effective tax rate for the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 included discrete net tax benefits of $165. During the third quarter of 2019, we recognized a net benefit of $73 related to U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends, net of losses of current year foreign tax credits, which impacted the effective tax rate. The tax rate for the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 was 26.8% , excluding the discrete benefits, but including the impact of the lost foreign tax credits. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 36 Weeks Ended May 12, 2019 May 13, 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,063 $ 4,220 Net cash used in investing activities (1,945 ) (1,852 ) Net cash used in financing activities (1,146 ) (1,014 ) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $8,167 and $7,259 at May 12, 2019 , and September 2, 2018 , respectively. Of these balances, approximately $1,460 and $1,348 represented unsettled credit and debit card receivables, respectively. These receivables generally settle within four days. Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements and, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we no longer consider earnings after fiscal 2017 of our non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $4,063 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 , compared to $4,220 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2018 . Cash provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise vendors, and warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and debit and credit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors including how fast our inventory is sold, the payment terms with our vendors, and the amount of payables we pay early to obtain favorable discounts from our vendors. 27 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,945 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 compared to $1,852 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2018 , and primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Expenditure Plans Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations and working capital. In the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 , we spent $1,989 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $2,800 to $3,100 during fiscal 2019 . We opened 13 new warehouses, including three relocations, in the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 and plan to open 13 additional new warehouses, including two relocations, in the remainder of fiscal 2019 . There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,146 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 compared to $1,014 in the first thirty-six weeks of 2018 . Cash flow used in financing activities primarily related to the payment of dividends, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, and repurchases of common stock. Dividends totaling $752 were paid during the first thirty-six weeks of 2019, of which $250 related to the dividend declared in August 2018. Stock Repurchase Programs On April 26, 2019 , the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000 , which expires in April 2023 . During the first thirty-six weeks of 2019 and 2018 , we repurchased 903,000 and 1,337,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $215.94 and $174.30 , respectively, totaling approximately $195 and $233 , respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Dividends On April 26, 2019 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share payable to shareholders of record on May 10, 2019 . The dividend was paid on May 24, 2019 . Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At May 12, 2019 , we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $880, including a $400 revolving line of credit, which expires in June 2019. The Company currently has no plans to draw upon this facility but intends to renew it. Our international operations maintain $353 of the borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $146 is guaranteed by the Company. There were no outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of the third quarter of 2019 or at the end of fiscal 2018 . The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $234. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of the third quarter of 2019 totaled $162, most of which were standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. 28 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations As of the date of this Report, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since the end of our last fiscal year. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base these on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018 . There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in that Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. Item 3—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our direct exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. There have been no material changes to our market risks as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018 . Item 4—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of May 12, 2019 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of that date due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that was disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting except as described below. Remediation As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018, we began implementing a remediation plan to address the material weakness mentioned above. The weakness will not be considered remediated, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed prior to the end of fiscal 2019. 29 Table of Contents PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1—Legal Proceedings See discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.

STATEMENTS (amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data) (unaudited) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. For the period ended February 17, 2019 , Costco operated 769 warehouses worldwide: 534 in the United States (U.S.) located in 44 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 100 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 28 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 26 in Japan, 15 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, 10 in Australia, two in Spain, and one each in Iceland and France. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, and Taiwan. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net income excludes income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Taiwan. During the first quarter of 2018 , the Company purchased its former joint venture partner's remaining equity interest in its Korean operations. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018 . Fiscal Year End The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2019 is a 52 week year ending on September 1, 2019 . References to the second quarter of 2019 and 2018 relate to the 12 week fiscal quarters ended February 17, 2019 , and February 18, 2018 , respectively. References to the first half of 2019 and 2018 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 17, 2019, and February 18, 2018, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 9 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and merchandise returns. The Company reserves for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Merchandise Sales - The Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods. The Company also provides expanded products and services through warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The majority of revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is recognized upon shipment to the member to the extent there is no installation provided as a part of the contract. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the condensed consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Principal Versus Agent - The Company is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally is established when Costco is primarily responsible for merchandising decisions, maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member service and satisfaction, and has pricing discretion. Membership Fees - The Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. For the first half of 2019 , the Company recognized $1,526 of membership fees, of which $1,144 was included in deferred membership at the end of 2018 . In certain countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of approximately $1,000 per year), which does not expire and can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. In the second quarter of 2019 and 2018 the net reduction in sales was $364 and $329 , respectively. In the first half of 2019 and 2018 the net reduction in sales was $714 and $646 , respectively. Cash Cards - The Company sells and otherwise provides proprietary cash cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from cash cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for outstanding cash card balances as a cash card liability, net of estimated breakage and as of February 17, 2019 , and September 2, 2018, the cash card liability was not material. Co-Brand Credit Card Program - Citibank, N.A. (“Citi”) became the exclusive issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members in June 2016. The Company receives various forms of consideration, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco, a portion of which is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receive after giving rise to estimated breakage. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31 of each year. Breakage is estimated based on redemption data. 10 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, providing for changes in the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance requires disclosures sufficient to describe the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows. The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019, using the modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $16 as an increase to retained earnings, which is included in cash dividend declared and other in the condensed consolidated statements of equity. The standard impacted the presentation and timing of certain revenue transactions. Specifically, the changes included gross presentation of the Company’s estimate of merchandise returns reserve and related recoverable assets, recognizing cash card breakage over the period of redemption, and accelerating the recognition of certain e-commerce and special order sales. Additionally, the Company’s evaluation under the standard of its status as a principal in certain vendor arrangements resulted in the recognition of additional sales on a gross basis. The effect of the standard on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet was an increase to other current liabilities and other current assets of $649 and $731 at adoption and at the end of the second quarter of 2019, respectively, related to the estimate of merchandise returns reserve and the related recoverable assets. The effect of the adoption of this standard on the Company's condensed consolidated statement of income is as follows: As Reported ASU 2014-09 Effect Excluding ASU 2014-09 Effect 12 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 Net Sales $ 34,628 $ 179 $ 34,449 Merchandise Costs 30,720 183 30,537 Gross Margin (1) 3,908 (4 ) 3,912 24 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 Net Sales $ 68,939 $ 519 $ 68,420 Merchandise Costs 61,343 514 60,829 Gross Margin (1) 7,596 5 7,591 _______________ (1) Net sales less merchandise costs. For related disaggregated revenue disclosures, see Note 10 . Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires recognition on the balance sheet of rights and obligations created by leases with terms greater than twelve months. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2020 and utilize the transition option, which allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption and does not require application of the guidance to comparative periods. The primary effect of adoption will be recording right-of-use assets and corresponding lease obligations for current operating leases. The adoption is expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheets, but not on the consolidated statements of income or cash flows. The Company is reviewing current accounting policies and related disclosures, and evaluating changes to business processes, systems and controls to support adoption of the new standard, which includes implementing a new lease accounting system. 11 Table of Contents Note 2—Investments The Company's investments were as follows: February 17, 2019: Cost Basis Unrealized Loss, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 892 $ (8 ) $ 884 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 158 158 Total short-term investments $ 1,050 $ (8 ) $ 1,042 September 2, 2018: Cost Basis Unrealized Loss, Net Recorded Basis Available-for-sale: Government and agency securities $ 912 $ (14 ) $ 898 Held-to-maturity: Certificates of deposit 306 306 Total short-term investments $ 1,218 $ (14 ) $ 1,204 Gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material for the second quarter and first half of 2019 and 2018 .

The remaining amount available for stock repurchases under our approved plan, which expires in April 2019, was $2,276 at February 17, 2019 . Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. 14 Table of Contents Note 6—Stock-Based Compensation On January 24, 2019, our shareholders approved the adoption of the 2019 Incentive Plan, which replaced the Seventh Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (Seventh Plan). The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares ( 10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant under the Seventh Plan on January 24, 2019 and future forfeited shares from grants under the Seventh Plan up to a maximum aggregate of 27,800,000 ( 15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes. Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity At February 17, 2019 , 15,577,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs and the following awards were outstanding: • 6,385,000 time-based RSUs that vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time; • 91,000 performance-based RSUs, granted to executive officers of the Company, for which the performance targets have been met. The awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time; and • 150,000 performance-based RSUs, granted to executive officers of the Company, subject to achievement of performance targets for fiscal 2019 , as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors after the end of the fiscal year. These awards are included in the table below and the Company recognized compensation expense for these awards as it is currently deemed probable that the targets will be achieved. The following table summarizes RSU transactions during the first half of 2019 : Number of Units (in 000’s) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at September 2, 2018 7,578 $ 140.85 Granted 2,792 224.00 Vested and delivered (3,688 ) 155.67 Forfeited (56 ) 160.93 Outstanding at February 17, 2019 6,626 $ 167.48 The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at February 17, 2019 , was $ 919 , and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.7 years. Summary of Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits under the Company’s plans: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 Stock-based compensation expense before income taxes $ 119 $ 112 $ 389 $ 346 Less recognized income tax benefit (23 ) (2 ) (84 ) (79 ) Stock-based compensation expense, net of income taxes $ 96 $ 110 $ 305 $ 267 15 Table of Contents Note 7—Income Taxes In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) was signed into law. The Company is a fiscal-year taxpayer, so most provisions became effective for fiscal 2019, including the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction and limitations on certain business deductions. During the quarter ended February 17, 2019, the measurement period related to the 2017 Tax Act concluded and the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the final determinations on its accounting implications based on the Company's interpretations. Note 8—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000’s): 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 Net income attributable to Costco $ 889 $ 701 $ 1,656 $ 1,341 Weighted average number of common shares used in basic net income per common share 440,284 439,022 439,721 438,494 RSUs 2,053 2,546 2,814 2,707 Weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential of common stock used in diluted net income per share 442,337 441,568 442,535 441,201 Anti-dilutive RSUs 1,667 — — — 16 Table of Contents Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded an immaterial accrual with respect to one matter described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. The Company is a defendant in a class action alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to member service assistants who act as greeters in the Company’s California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (Case No. 5:13-cv-03598, N.D. Cal. filed July 1, 2013). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. The action in the district court has been stayed pending review by the Ninth Circuit of the order certifying a class. In January 2019, an employee brought similar claims for relief concerning Costco employees engaged at member services counters in California. Rodriguez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. RG19001310, Alameda Superior Court filed Jan. 4, 2019). In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that employees in California did not receive suitable seating or appropriate workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Dec. 6, 2018 Notice to California Labor and Workforce Development Agency). In January 2019, a former seasonal employee filed a class action, alleging failure to provide California seasonal employees meal and rest breaks, proper wage statements, and appropriate wages. Jordan v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-CV-340438 Santa Clara Superior Court filed Jan. 3, 2019). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. On November 23, 2016, the Company’s Canadian subsidiary received from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care a request for an inspection and information concerning compliance with the anti-rebate provisions in the Ontario Drug Benefit Act and the Drug Interchangeability and Dispensing Fee Act. On February 1, 2019, with the consent of the Company’s subsidiary the Ministry entered an order requiring CWC Pharmacies (Ontario) Ltd., a subsidiary of the Company, to pay five million in satisfaction of the issues raised in the investigation, which was paid during the quarter. The Company had accrued for this liability in a prior period. In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, and third-party payors concerning the impacts of opioid abuse. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are federal cases that name the Company, including actions filed by a number of counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey and Ohio, and a third-party payor in Ohio. Similar claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey and Oklahoma have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of these matters. 17 Table of Contents The Company and its CEO and CFO are defendants in putative class actions brought on behalf of shareholders who acquired Company stock between June 6 and October 25, 2018. Johnson v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash. filed Nov. 5, 2018); Chen v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (W.D. Wash. filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaints allege violations of the federal securities laws stemming from the Company’s disclosures concerning internal control over financial reporting. They seek unspecified damages, equitable relief, interest, and costs and attorneys’ fees. On January 30, 2019, an order was entered consolidating the actions. The Company expects the consolidated action to be vigorously defended. Members of the Board of Directors, one other individual, and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to the internal controls and related disclosures identified in the putative class actions, alleging that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties. Wedekind v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (W.D. Wash. filed Dec. 11, 2018). The complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement of compensation, corporate governance changes, and costs and attorneys' fees. Because the complaint is derivative in nature, it does not seek monetary damages from the Company, which is a nominal defendant. By agreement among the parties the action has been stayed pending further proceedings in the class actions. A similar action was filed in King County Superior Court on February 20, 2019. Elliott v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach, Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-04824-7). In November 2016 and September 2017, the Company received notices of violation from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection regarding hazardous waste practices at its Connecticut warehouses, primarily concerning unsalable pharmaceuticals. On February 13, 2019, the Company's affiliate in Spain received notice from the General Directorate on Environment and Sustainability of the Regional Government of Madrid that the Directorate is investigating issues concerning rain, sewage and hydrocarbon drainage related to the Company's warehouse in Getafe. The relief to be sought is not known at this time. The Company is seeking to cooperate concerning the resolution of these notices. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter. Note 10—Segment Reporting The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland and France and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which consider geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018 , and Note 1 above. Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, are incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International Operations, but are included in the U.S. Operations because those costs generally come under the responsibility of the Company's U.S. management team. 18 Table of Contents The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments: United States Operations Canadian Operations Other International Operations Total 12 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 Total revenue $ 25,872 $ 4,792 $ 4,732 $ 35,396 Operating income 812 198 193 1,203 Depreciation and amortization 256 37 59 352 Additions to property and equipment 404 77 106 587 12 Weeks Ended February 18, 2018 Total revenue $ 23,687 $ 4,745 $ 4,563 $ 32,995 Operating income 603 206 207 1,016 Depreciation and amortization 262 31 51 344 Additions to property and equipment 375 39 94 508 24 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 Total revenue $ 51,422 $ 9,769 $ 9,274 $ 70,465 Operating income 1,372 412 368 2,152 Depreciation and amortization 504 68 111 683 Additions to property and equipment 928 171 218 1,317 Net property and equipment 13,725 1,937 4,483 20,145 Total assets 30,033 4,250 8,516 42,799 24 Weeks Ended February 18, 2018 Total revenue $ 46,500 $ 9,516 $ 8,788 $ 64,804 Operating income 1,136 442 389 1,967 Depreciation and amortization 514 63 102 679 Additions to property and equipment 855 114 359 1,328 Net property and equipment 12,690 1,852 4,507 19,049 Total assets 26,417 3,825 8,461 38,703 52 Weeks Ended September 2, 2018 Total revenue $ 102,286 $ 20,689 $ 18,601 $ 141,576 Operating income 2,787 939 754 4,480 Depreciation and amortization 1,078 135 224 1,437 Additions to property and equipment 2,046 268 655 2,969 Net property and equipment 13,353 1,900 4,428 19,681 Total assets 28,207 4,303 8,320 40,830 Disaggregated Revenue The following table summarizes net sales by merchandise category: 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 February 17, 2019 Foods and Sundries $ 13,966 $ 27,607 Hardlines 5,770 11,610 Fresh Foods 4,690 8,983 Softlines 4,224 8,347 Ancillary 5,978 12,392 Total Net Sales $ 34,628 $ 68,939 19 Table of Contents Item 2—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, and warehouse count data) FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained in this Report constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. This management discussion should be read in conjunction with the management discussion included in our fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, previously filed with the SEC. OVERVIEW We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth. We define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, as well as online sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions; and changes from the revenue recognition standard. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, 20 Table of Contents national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items and through our online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods– consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing can, from time to time, include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, negatively impacting near-term gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe that our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a significantly lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. We also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales. Our membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefits costs as a percentage of country sales, and/or less or no direct membership warehouse competition. 21 Table of Contents In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which relates to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to the second quarters of 2019 and 2018 relate to the 12 week fiscal quarters ended February 17, 2019 , and February 18, 2018 , respectively. References to the first half of 2019 and 2018 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 17, 2019 , and February 18, 2018 , respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Key items for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the second quarter of 2018 include: • Net sales increased 7% to $34,628 , driven by an increase in comparable sales of 5% and sales at 22 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018 ; • Membership fee revenue increased 7% to $768 , primarily due to sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and the annual fee increase in the U.S. and Canada in June 2017; • Gross margin percentage increased 31 basis points primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly our gasoline business; • SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased two basis points due to leveraging increased sales; • Net income increased 27% to $889 , or $2.01 per diluted share, compared to $701 , or $1.59 per diluted share in 2018 ; • On January 24, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash-dividend of $0.57 per share, which was paid on February 22, 2019; and • Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we increased our starting and supervisor wages and will provide paid bonding leave for hourly employees in the U.S. and Canada, effective March 2019. The estimated annualized pre-tax cost of these increases is approximately $50-$60. 22 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 Net Sales $ 34,628 $ 32,279 $ 68,939 $ 63,396 Changes in net sales U.S 9 % 9 % 11 % 10 % Canada 1 % 12 % 3 % 14 % Other international 4 % 21 % 6 % 19 % Total Company 7 % 11 % 9 % 12 % Changes in comparable sales: U.S 7 % 7 % 9 % 9 % Canada 0 % 9 % 1 % 10 % Other international 1 % 16 % 2 % 13 % Total Company 5 % 8 % 7 % 9 % Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency and gasoline prices (1) : U.S 7 % 6 % 8 % 7 % Canada 6 % 2 % 6 % 3 % Other international 5 % 7 % 5 % 8 % Total Company 7 % 5 % 7 % 7 % _______________ (1) Excludes the impact of the revenue recognition standard for the periods ended February 17, 2019 . See Item 1 Note 1. Net Sales Net sales increased $2,349 or 7% , and $5,543 or 9% during the second quarter and first half of 2019 , respectively, compared to the second quarter and first half of 2018 . These increases were attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 5% and 7% in the second quarter and first half of 2019 , respectively, and sales at the 22 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second quarter of 2018 . During the second quarter of 2019, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $460 , or 142 basis points, compared to the second quarter of 2018 , attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. Changes in gasoline prices also negatively impacted net sales by approximately $195 , or 60 basis points, due to a 5% decrease in the average price per gallon. The new revenue recognition standard positively impacted net sales by $ 179 , or 55 basis points. During the first half of 2019, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $773 , or 122 basis points, compared to the first half of 2018 , attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations. The new revenue recognition standard positively impacted net sales by $ 519 , or 82 basis points. Changes in gasoline prices also positively impacted net sales by approximately $226 , or 36 basis points, due to a 4% increase in the average price per gallon. 23 Table of Contents Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 5% and 7% in the second quarter and first half of 2019 , respectively, and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and the average ticket. Comparable sales for the second quarter and first half of 2019 were negatively impacted by cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Membership Fees 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 Membership fees $ 768 $ 716 $ 1,526 $ 1,408 Membership fees as a percentage of net sales 2.22 % 2.22 % 2.21 % 2.22 % Total paid members as of quarter end (000's) 52,700 50,400 — — Total cardholders as of quarter end (000's) 96,300 92,200 — — Membership fees increased 7% and 8% in the second quarter and first half of 2019 , respectively. This was primarily due to sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and the fee increase (discussed below). Renewal rates are 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide. As previously reported, in fiscal 2017 we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. These fee increases had a positive impact on revenues during the second quarter and first half of 2019 of approximately $24 and $61, respectively. Gross Margin 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 Net sales $ 34,628 $ 32,279 $ 68,939 $ 63,396 Less merchandise costs 30,720 28,733 61,343 56,350 Gross margin $ 3,908 $ 3,546 $ 7,596 $ 7,046 Gross margin percentage 11.29 % 10.98 % 11.02 % 11.11 % Quarterly Results The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased eight basis points, primarily due to increases in food and sundries and fresh foods, partially offset by decreases in hardlines and softlines. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Total gross margin percentage increased 31 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2018 . Excluding the impacts of gasoline price deflation and the new revenue recognition standard on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.28%, an increase of 30 basis points. This was primarily due to a 32 basis point increase in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly our gasoline business. Core merchandise categories were also higher by one basis point. Executive Membership 2% reward program negatively impacted gross margin by three basis points, due to increased spending by Executive Members. 24 Table of Contents Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased in our U.S. operations, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly our gasoline business. The segment gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations decreased primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Other International operations decreased, primarily in our core merchandise categories. Year-to-date Results The gross margin of core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales, increased one basis point. This was attributable to increases in food and sundries partially offset by decreases in softlines and fresh foods. Total gross margin percentage decreased nine basis points compared to the first half of 2018 . Excluding the impacts of gasoline price inflation and the new revenue recognition standard on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.14%, an increase of three basis points from the first half of 2018 . This was primarily due to a 22 basis point increase in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly our gasoline business. This increase was partially offset by decreases of nine basis points in our core merchandise categories and six basis points due to an adjustment to our estimate of breakage on rewards earned under our co-branded credit card program. The segment gross margin percentage increased in our U.S. operations, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly our gasoline business. This was partially offset by decreases from the breakage adjustment noted above and lower gross margins in certain of our core merchandise categories. The segment gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations decreased due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories. The segment gross margin percentage in our Other International operations decreased due to our core merchandise categories. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 SG&A expenses $ 3,464 $ 3,234 $ 6,939 $ 6,458 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 10.00 % 10.02 % 10.06 % 10.19 % Quarterly Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased two basis points compared to the second quarter of 2018 . The combined effect of gasoline price deflation and the new revenue recognition standard had no impact on SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. Operating costs related to warehouse, ancillary and other businesses, which includes e-commerce and travel, decreased two basis points, due to leveraging increased sales, partially offset by the wage increases of our U.S. hourly employees that went into effect in June 2018. Year-to-date Results SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 13 basis points compared to the first half of 2018 . Excluding the impacts of gasoline price inflation and the new revenue recognition standard on net sales, SG&A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.18%, a decrease of one basis point. Operating costs related to warehouse, ancillary and other businesses, which includes e-commerce and travel, were lower by three basis points, predominantly in our U.S. operations, due to leveraging increased sales. Central operating costs were lower by one basis point. Stock compensation expense was higher by three basis points. 25 Table of Contents Preopening Expense 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 Preopening expenses $ 9 $ 12 $ 31 $ 29 Warehouse openings, including relocations United States 2 1 8 7 Canada 0 0 2 1 Other International 0 0 0 0 Total warehouse openings, including relocations 2 1 10 8 Preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets, new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the openings relative to our quarter-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market. For the remainder of fiscal 2019 , we expect to open 17 warehouses, including two relocations. Interest Expense 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 Interest expense $ 34 $ 37 $ 70 $ 74 Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes. In October 2018 we repaid a Guaranteed Senior Note issued by our Japanese subsidiary. Interest Income and Other, Net 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 Interest income $ 33 $ 16 $ 54 $ 29 Foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), net 8 (14 ) 3 (10 ) Other, net 5 5 11 10 Interest income and other, net $ 46 $ 7 $ 68 $ 29 Interest income increased for the second quarter and first half of 2019 , due to higher interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances. Foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), net, include the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations and mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts. See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Item 8, Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018 . 26 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 Provision for income taxes $ 314 $ 273 $ 472 $ 558 Effective tax rate 25.8 % 27.7 % 21.9 % 29.0 % The effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of 2019 was favorably impacted by the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which was in effect for the entire second quarter and first half of 2019, as compared to a higher blended rate effective for the second quarter and first half of 2018. The effective tax rate for the first half of 2019 included discrete net tax benefits of $90 which largely related to the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.1% for the first half of 2019. The tax rate includes a benefit for certain foreign tax credits, which were originally disallowed beginning in fiscal 2019. Similar credits will not be allowed in future years. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 24 Weeks Ended February 17, 2019 February 18, 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,958 $ 2,115 Net cash used in investing activities (1,171 ) (1,158 ) Net cash used in financing activities (749 ) (748 ) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $7,122 and $7,259 at February 17, 2019 , and September 2, 2018 , respectively. Of these balances, approximately $1,215 and $1,348 represented unsettled credit and debit card receivables, respectively. These receivables generally settle within four days. Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements and, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we no longer consider earnings of our non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested. We consider undistributed earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries prior to fiscal 2018 to be indefinitely reinvested. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,958 in the first half of 2019 , compared to $2,115 in the first half of 2018 . Cash provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise vendors, warehouse operating costs including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and debit and credit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,171 in the first half of 2019 compared to $1,158 in the first half of 2018 , and primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. 27 Table of Contents Capital Expenditure Plans Our primary requirements for capital is acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations and working capital. In the first half of 2019 , we spent $1,317 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $2,800 to $3,100 during fiscal 2019 . We opened 10 new warehouses, including three relocations, in the first half of 2019 and plan to open 17 additional new warehouses, including two relocations, in the remainder of fiscal 2019 . There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $749 in the first half of 2019 compared to $748 in the first half of 2018 . Cash flow used in financing activities primarily related to the payment of dividends and withholding taxes on stock-based awards. Dividends totaling $501 were paid during the first half of 2019, of which $250 related to the dividend declared in August 2018 and $251 related to the dividend declared in October 2018. Stock Repurchase Programs During the first half of 2019 and 2018 , we repurchased 711,000 and 1,047,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $213.08 and $170.06 , respectively, totaling approximately $151 and $178 , respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of a quarter. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Dividends On January 24, 2019 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share payable to shareholders of record on February 8, 2019 . The dividend was paid on February 22, 2019 . Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At February 17, 2019 , we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $870, including a $400 revolving line of credit, which expires in June 2019. The Company currently has no plans to draw upon this facility. Our international operations maintain $343 of the borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $146 is guaranteed by the Company. There were no outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of the second quarter of 2019 or at the end of 2018 . The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $235. The outstanding standby letters of credit under these facilities at the end of the second quarter of 2019 totaled $164, and many expire within one year. Bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs that expire typically have a one-year term and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit then outstanding. 28 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations As of the date of this Report, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since the end of our last fiscal year. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base these on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018 . There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in that Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. Item 3—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our direct exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. There have been no material changes to our market risks as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018 . Item 4—Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of February 17, 2019 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of that date due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that was disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Remediation As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018, we began implementing a remediation plan to address the material weakness mentioned above. The weakness will not be considered remediated, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed prior to the end of fiscal 2019. 29 Table of Contents PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1—Legal Proceedings See discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.

Item 3—Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4—Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5—Other Information On March 11, 2019, we filed with the Washington Secretary of State Articles of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the “Charter” and, such Articles of Amendment, the “Article of Amendment”) to declassify our Board of Directors beginning at the annual meeting of shareholders in 2020. Prior to the filing of the Articles of Amendment, Article V of the Charter provided that the Board of Directors would be divided into three classes of directors, with one class of directors being elected each year. The Articles of Amendment provide that, commencing with the annual meeting of shareholders in 2020, directors standing for election will be elected for one year terms. Directors elected to three-year terms prior to the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders will complete those terms, and the entire Board of Directors will be elected annually commencing with the 2022 annual meeting of the shareholders. A detailed description of the declassification amendments is set forth in our Definitive Proxy Statement for the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 17, 2018. Effective as of March 11, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company amended section 3.4 of the Bylaws, as amended, to conform that provision to the Articles of Amendment. The foregoing descriptions of the Articles of Amendment and Bylaws, as amended, are qualified in their entirety by reference to the texts of such documents, which are filed as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 30 Table of Contents Item 6—Exhibits The following exhibits are filed as part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or are incorporated herein by reference.

Among other things, the new guidance requires expanded disclosure about key program terms, payment terms, and amounts outstanding for obligations under these programs for each period presented. The company adopted some aspects of this guidance in 2023 using a retrospective method and will adopt other aspects in 2024 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the company’s disclosures; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of arrangements of this nature entered into by the company. In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance to require entities to disclose information about certain types of government assistance they receive, including cash grants and tax credits. Among other things, the new guidance requires expanded disclosure regarding the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the nature, amount, timing, and significant terms and conditions of transactions with a government arising from a grant or other forms of assistance accounted for under a contribution model. The company adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2022 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. 9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 2. Acquisitions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses and the benefits that will be gained from the assembled workforces. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products and services; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products and services. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. 2023 On January 3, 2023, the company acquired, within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, The Binding Site Group, a U.K.-based provider of specialty diagnostic assays and instruments to improve the diagnosis and management of blood cancers and immune system disorders. The acquisition expands the segment’s portfolio with the addition of pioneering innovation in diagnostics and monitoring for multiple myeloma. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not tax deductible. On August 14, 2023, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, CorEvitas, LLC, a U.S.-based provider of regulatory-grade, real-world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies. The acquisition expands the segment’s portfolio with the addition of highly complementary real-world evidence solutions to enhance decision-making as well as the time and cost of drug development. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not expected to be tax deductible. The components of the purchase price and net assets acquired are as follows: (In millions) The Binding Site CorEvitas Purchase price Cash paid $ 2,412 $ 730 Debt settled 307 184 Cash acquired ( 20 ) ( 4 ) $ 2,699 $ 910 Net assets acquired Definite-lived intangible assets: Customer relationships $ 868 $ 260 Product technology 172 47 Tradenames 42 — Backlog — 46 Goodwill 1,756 626 Net tangible assets 140 ( 1 ) Deferred tax assets (liabilities) ( 279 ) ( 68 ) $ 2,699 $ 910 In addition, in 2023, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a U.S.-based developer of Raman-based spectroscopy solutions for in-line measurement. The weighted-average amortization period for definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2023 are 18 years for customer relationships, 14 years for product technology, 15 years for tradenames, and 13 years for backlog. The weighted average amortization period for all definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2023 is 17 years. Proposed Acquisition On October 17, 2023, the company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Olink Holding AB (publ) at a price of $ 26.00 per share, or approximately $ 3.1 billion. Olink is a leading provider of next-generation proteomics solutions that will expand the company’s capabilities in this field. The company has commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the American Depositary Shares and common shares of Olink. The transaction is expected to close by mid-year 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, and completion of the tender offer. Upon completion, Olink will become part of the Life Sciences Solutions segment. The company intends to finance the purchase price with cash on hand and the net proceeds from issuances of debt. 10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

In the first nine months of 2023 the company also recorded a tax benefit of $ 91 million, net of related tax expenses, from a foreign exchange loss on an intercompany debt refinancing transaction, as well as a $ 144 million tax benefit resulting from a capital loss generated as part of an intra-entity transaction. During the third quarter of 2022, the company settled an IRS audit relating to the 2017 and 2018 tax years. The company recorded a $ 208 million net tax benefit primarily from this settlement and related impacts, which resulted in a decrease in the company’s unrecognized tax benefits of $ 658 million. The company recorded $ 49 million of charges for expired tax credits and other related components of the settlement. The company recorded a charge of $ 395 million to establish a valuation allowance against certain U.S. foreign tax credits which the company believes will more likely than not expire unutilized. The company also recorded $ 101 million of additional net unrecognized tax benefit liabilities related to other tax audits. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 70 countries outside the U.S. The company's effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate each year due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives, state and local taxes, and foreign taxes that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of September 30, 2023 the company had $ 0.55 billion of unrecognized tax benefits substantially all of which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.

See Note 10 for fair value information pertaining to the company’s long-term borrowings. Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility (the Facility) with a bank group that provides for up to $ 5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The Facility expires on January 7, 2027. The revolving credit agreement calls for interest at either a Term SOFR, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of September 30, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit. 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. Senior Notes Interest is payable quarterly on the floating rate senior notes, annually on the euro-denominated fixed rate senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the U.S. dollar and euro-denominated fixed rate senior notes and yen-denominated private placement notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest, together with swap breakage costs payable to holders of yen-denominated private placement notes who have entered into cross-currency swap agreements. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures and note purchase agreement governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge certain property and assets as security under borrowing arrangements. The company was in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2023. In the first quarter of 2022, the company redeemed all of its 3.650 % Senior Notes due 2025. In connection with the redemption, the company incurred $ 26 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in other income/(expense) on the accompanying statements of income. Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V. (Thermo Fisher International), a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued each of the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00 % Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00 % Senior Notes due 2025, the 0.80 % Senior Notes due 2030, the 1.125 % Senior Notes due 2033, the 1.625 % Senior Notes due 2041, and the 2.00 % Senior Notes due 2051 included in the table above (collectively, the “Euronotes”) in registered public offerings. The company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of Thermo Fisher International’s obligations under the Euronotes and all of Thermo Fisher International’s other debt securities, and no other subsidiary of the company will guarantee these obligations. Thermo Fisher International is a “finance subsidiary” as defined in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of the Exchange Act, with no assets or operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Euronotes and other debt securities issued by Thermo Fisher International from time to time. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Thermo Fisher International are consolidated in the financial statements of the company. Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. At September 30, 2023, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending environmental-related matters disclosed in the company’s 2022 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies The company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The disputes and litigation matters include product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for 16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) which accrual amounts are not disclosed in the company’s 2022 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more such matters could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters The company is involved in various proceedings and litigation that arise from time to time in connection with product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters. At September 30, 2023, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending product liability, workers compensation, and other personal injury matters disclosed in the company’s 2022 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated insurance recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. Note 9.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company initially measures the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on amounts expected to be transferred (probability-weighted) discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the company recorded $ 11 million and $( 33 ) million, respectively, of net gains/(losses) on investments, which are included in other income/(expense) in the accompanying statements of income. In the three and nine months ended October 1, 2022, the company recorded $ 13 million and $ 136 million, respectively, of net losses on investments, which are included in other income/(expense) in the accompanying statements of income. The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs (such as likelihood of achieving production or revenue milestones, as well as changes in the fair values of the investments underlying a recapitalization investment portfolio), of the contingent consideration. 18 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Gains and losses recognized on currency exchange contracts are included in the accompanying statements of income together with the corresponding, offsetting losses and gains on the underlying hedged transactions. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2022 included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the company’s risk management objectives and strategies.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 12. Restructuring and Other Costs In the first nine months of 2023, restructuring and other costs primarily included continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, impairment of long-lived assets, and, to a lesser extent, net charges for pre-acquisition litigation and other matters. In 2023, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected approximately 4 % of the company’s workforce. As of November 3, 2023, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $ 65 million, primarily in 2023, and expects to identify additional actions in future periods which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred.

(c) Excludes $ 39 million of charges for impairment of a disposal group that was held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2023. The loss attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. was reduced by $ 19 million attributable to a noncontrolling interest. The company expects to pay accrued restructuring costs primarily through 2023. 21 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), are made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding: projections of revenues, expenses, earnings, margins, tax rates, tax provisions, cash flows, pension and benefit obligations and funding requirements, and our liquidity position; cost reductions, restructuring activities, new product and service developments, competitive strengths or market position, acquisitions or divestitures; growth, declines and other trends in markets we sell into; new or modified laws, regulations and accounting pronouncements; outstanding claims, legal proceedings, tax audits and assessments and other contingent liabilities; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; general economic and capital markets conditions; the timing of any of the foregoing; assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; the COVID-19 pandemic; and any other statements that address events or developments that Thermo Fisher intends or believes will or may occur in the future. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements are accompanied by such words. While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the company’s estimates change, and readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing the company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this report. A number of important factors could cause the results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the caption “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (which is on file with the SEC). Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties relating to: the COVID-19 pandemic; the need to develop new products and adapt to significant technological change; implementation of strategies for improving growth; general economic conditions and related uncertainties; dependence on customers’ capital spending policies and government funding policies; the effect of economic and political conditions and exchange rate fluctuations on international operations; use and protection of intellectual property; the effect of changes in governmental regulations; any natural disaster, public health crisis or other catastrophic event; and the effect of laws and regulations governing government contracts, as well as the possibility that expected benefits related to recent or pending acquisitions, including our proposed acquisition of Olink, may not materialize as expected. The company refers to various amounts or measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to their most directly comparable amount or measure under the section “ Non-GAAP Measures ” later in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Overview Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. The company’s operations fall into four segments (Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services.

The biosciences and bioproduction businesses have expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they have expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, our pharma services business has provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. Since the company’s acquisition of PPD in December 2021, the clinical research business has continued to play a leading role in supporting the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. These positive impacts are expected to continue at much lower levels in 2023 as customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand declines. Sales of products related to COVID-19 testing were $0.05 billion and $0.44 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $0.27 billion and $2.75 billion in the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the third quarter of 2023, growth declined slightly from pharma and biotech customers driven by lower demand associated with COVID-19 vaccine and therapies as well as the continued impact on customers from a more challenging macroeconomic environment and low economic activity in China. We saw very strong growth from academic and government customers, with strong adoption of our high-impact innovation. The industrial and applied market was flat, driven by more challenging macroeconomic environment and low economic activity in China. The diagnostics and healthcare market declined due to decreased demand for COVID-19 testing products. During the third quarter of 2023, sales growth in North America and Asia Pacific declined, while Europe grew slightly. Sales growth in all regions was impacted by decreased demand in 2023 for COVID-19 related products and the impact on customers from a more challenging macroeconomic environment. Asia Pacific was impacted by low economic activity in China. Contributions to organic revenue during the third quarter of 2023 from the Analytical Instruments and Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments were more than offset by declines in the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments. During the first nine months of 2023, we saw slight growth from pharma and biotech customers driven by our trusted partner status, partially offset by the impact on customers from a more challenging macroeconomic environment and low economic activity in China. We saw broad based strength across the academic and government market. The industrial and applied market was strong, driven by continued strong demand for our analytical instruments serving our semiconductor and materials science customers. The diagnostics and healthcare market declined due to decreased demand for COVID-19 testing products. During the first nine months of 2023, sales growth in all major regions declined due to decreased demand for COVID-19 related products, as well as a challenging macroeconomic environment and low economic activity in China. Contributions to organic revenue during the first nine months of 2023 from the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services and Analytical Instruments segments were more than offset by declines in the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments. The company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars: • High-impact innovation, • Our trusted partner status with customers, and • Our unparalleled commercial engine. GAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin increased in the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to exceptionally strong productivity improvements and good price realization, partially offset by lower COVID-19 related revenue. GAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin decreased in the first nine months of 2023 due primarily to lower COVID-19 related revenue. This was partially offset by strong productivity improvements and strong pricing realization to address higher inflation. GAAP operating income margin in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 was also impacted by restructuring and other charges incurred for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations and limit the impact of expected lower revenue (Note 12). The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, 23 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Notable Recent Acquisitions On January 3, 2023, the company acquired, within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, The Binding Site Group, a U.K.-based provider of specialty diagnostic assays and instruments to improve the diagnosis and management of blood cancers and immune system disorders. The acquisition expands the segment’s portfolio with the addition of pioneering innovation in diagnostics and monitoring for multiple myeloma. On August 14, 2023, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, CorEvitas, LLC, a U.S.-based provider of regulatory-grade, real-world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies. The acquisition expands the segment’s portfolio with the addition of highly complementary real-world evidence solutions to enhance decision-making as well as the time and cost of drug development. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits as defined in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2022.

See additional discussion under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, the company’s net interest expense was reduced by approximately $34 million and $62 million, respectively, as a result of its interest rate swap and cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements (Note 10). GAAP other income/(expense) and adjusted other income/(expense) includes currency transaction gains/losses on non-operating monetary assets and liabilities, and net periodic pension benefit cost/income, excluding the service cost component. GAAP other income/(expense) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 also includes $10 million and $(33) million of net gains/(losses) on investments, respectively. GAAP other income/(expense) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 also includes $12 million and $135 million, respectively, of net losses on investments. GAAP other income/expense in the first nine months of 2022 also includes $26 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 7). The GAAP and adjusted tax rates in 2023 were impacted by the release of a valuation allowance of $183 million in the third quarter of 2023 in jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are now expected to be realized, and, to a lesser extent, by a decrease in pre-tax earnings compared to 2022. The company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates in 2023 were also impacted by tax planning initiatives, including a tax benefit of $91 million, net of related tax expenses, from a foreign exchange loss on an intercompany debt refinancing transaction in the second quarter of 2023, as well as a $144 million tax benefit resulting from a capital loss generated in the first quarter of 2023 as part of an intra-entity transaction. The company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates in 2022 were impacted by releases of valuation allowances of $189 million in the first nine months of 2022 in jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are now expected to be realized. The company’s 2022 GAAP tax rate was also impacted by a net benefit of $208 million resulting from tax audit settlements in the third quarter of 2022 (Note 5). 26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. The effective tax rates in both 2023 and 2022 were also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total approximately $1.40 billion in 2023. The company expects its GAAP effective tax rate in 2023 will be between 3% and 5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. The company expects its adjusted tax rate will be approximately 10% in 2023. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 70 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Weighted average diluted shares decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to share repurchases, net of option dilution. Liquidity and Capital Resources The company’s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets. The company deploys its capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends. (In millions) September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 6,151 $ 8,524 Total debt 35,284 34,488 Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions, capacity expansion, and repayment of third-party foreign debt by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. As of September 30, 2023, the company’s short-term debt totaled $4.80 billion. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 7). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of September 30, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit. Nine months ended (In millions) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,683 $ 5,667 Net cash used in investing activities (4,766) (1,634) Net cash used in financing activities (2,194) (5,201) Free cash flow (non-GAAP measure) 3,685 3,992 Operating Activities During the first nine months of 2023, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $1.36 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $0.74 billion. Cash payments for income taxes were $1.17 billion during the first nine months of 2023. During the first nine months of 2022, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. An increase in inventories used cash of $1.12 billion, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. liabilities used cash of $0.73 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation. Cash payments for income taxes were $1.05 billion during the first nine months of 2022. Investing Activities During the first nine months of 2023, acquisitions used cash of $3.66 billion. The company’s investing activities also included purchases of $1.07 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. During the first nine months of 2022, acquisitions used cash of $0.04 billion. The company’s investing activities also included purchases of $1.69 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. The company expects that for all of 2023, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. Financing Activities During the first nine months of 2023, repayment of senior notes and net commercial paper activity used cash of $2.00 billion and $0.32 billion, respectively. Issuance of debt provided $3.47 billion of cash. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock (5.2 million shares) and the payment of $0.39 billion in cash dividends. On November 10, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.00 billion of the company’s common stock. All of the shares of common stock repurchased by the company during the first quarter of 2023 were under this program. During the first nine months of 2022, repayment of senior notes and net commercial paper activity used cash of $0.38 billion and $2.46 billion, respectively. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock (3.3 million shares) and the payment of $0.34 billion in cash dividends. The company’s commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially subsequent to September 30, 2023, except for the agreement to acquire Olink (Note 2). Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company’s short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods. We report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company’s core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable: • Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs. • Costs/income associated with restructuring activities and large-scale abandonments of product lines, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities and large-scale abandonment of product lines are not indicative of our normal operating costs. • Equity in earnings/losses of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. • The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. • The noncontrolling interest and tax impacts of the above items and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as changes in deferred taxes from enacted tax rate/law changes), the latter of which we exclude because they are outside of our normal operations and difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We report free cash flow, which is operating cash flow excluding net capital expenditures, to provide a view of the continuing operations’ ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. The company also uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. The non-GAAP financial measures of the company’s results of operations and cash flows included in this Form 10-Q are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for the company’s results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth within the “Consolidated Results” and “Segment Results” sections and below.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Interim Financial Statements The interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared by the company, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position at July 1, 2023, the results of operations for the three- and six-month periods ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022, and the cash flows for the six-month periods ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain all information that is included in the annual financial statements and notes thereto of the company. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the 2022 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2022 describes the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes in the company’s significant accounting policies during the six months ended July 1, 2023. Inventories The components of inventories are as follows: (In millions) July 1, 2023 December 31, 2022 Raw materials $ 2,368 $ 2,405 Work in process 760 660 Finished goods 2,527 2,569 Inventories $ 5,655 $ 5,634 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company’s estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2022, the FASB issued new guidance to require entities to disclose information about supplier finance programs. Among other things, the new guidance requires expanded disclosure about key program terms, payment terms, and amounts outstanding for obligations under these programs for each period presented. The company adopted some aspects of this guidance in 2023 using a retrospective method and will adopt other aspects in 2024 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the company’s disclosures; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of arrangements of this nature entered into by the company. In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance to require entities to disclose information about certain types of government assistance they receive, including cash grants and tax credits. Among other things, the new guidance requires expanded disclosure regarding the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the nature, amount, timing, and significant terms and conditions of transactions with a government arising from a grant or other forms of assistance accounted for under a contribution model. The company adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2022 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. 9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 2. Acquisitions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses and the benefits that will be gained from the assembled workforces. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products and services; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products and services. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. 2023 On January 3, 2023, the company acquired, within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, The Binding Site Group, a U.K.-based provider of specialty diagnostic assays and instruments to improve the diagnosis and management of blood cancers and immune system disorders. The acquisition expands the segment’s portfolio with the addition of pioneering innovation in diagnostics and monitoring for multiple myeloma. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not tax deductible. The components of the purchase price and net assets acquired are as follows: (In millions) The Binding Site Purchase price Cash paid $ 2,412 Debt settled 307 Cash acquired ( 20 ) $ 2,699 Net assets acquired Definite-lived intangible assets: Customer relationships $ 868 Product technology 172 Tradenames 42 Goodwill 1,755 Net tangible assets 141 Deferred tax assets (liabilities) ( 279 ) $ 2,699 In addition, in 2023, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a U.S.-based developer of Raman-based spectroscopy solutions for in-line measurement. The weighted-average amortization period for definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2023 are 18 years for customer relationships, 14 years for product technology and 15 years for tradenames. The weighted average amortization period for all definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2023 is 17 years. Pending Acquisition The company has entered into an agreement to acquire CorEvitas, LLC for approximately $ 0.91 billion in cash. CorEvitas provides regulatory-grade, real-world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies. The transaction, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2023, is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Upon completion, CorEvitas will become part of the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. 10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

See Note 10 for fair value information pertaining to the company’s long-term borrowings. Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility (the Facility) with a bank group that provides for up to $ 5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The Facility expires on January 7, 2027. The revolving credit agreement calls for interest at either a Term SOFR, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of July 1, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. Senior Notes Interest is payable quarterly on the floating rate senior notes, annually on the euro-denominated fixed rate senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the U.S. dollar and euro-denominated fixed rate senior notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. Except for the euro-denominated floating rate senior notes, which may not be redeemed early, the floating rate senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part on or after their applicable call dates at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. The company was in compliance with all covenants at July 1, 2023. In the first quarter of 2022, the company redeemed all of its 3.650 % Senior Notes due 2025. In connection with the redemption, the company incurred $ 26 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in other income/(expense) on the accompanying statements of income. 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V. (Thermo Fisher International), a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued each of the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00 % Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00 % Senior Notes due 2025, the 0.80 % Senior Notes due 2030, the 1.125 % Senior Notes due 2033, the 1.625 % Senior Notes due 2041, and the 2.00 % Senior Notes due 2051 included in the table above (collectively, the “Euronotes”) in registered public offerings. The company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of Thermo Fisher International’s obligations under the Euronotes and all of Thermo Fisher International’s other debt securities, and no other subsidiary of the company will guarantee these obligations. Thermo Fisher International is a “finance subsidiary” as defined in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of the Exchange Act, with no assets or operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Euronotes and other debt securities issued by Thermo Fisher International from time to time. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Thermo Fisher International are consolidated in the financial statements of the company. Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. At July 1, 2023, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending environmental-related matters disclosed in the company’s 2022 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies The company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The disputes and litigation matters include product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed in the company’s 2022 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more such matters could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters The company is involved in various proceedings and litigation that arise from time to time in connection with product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters. At July 1, 2023, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending product liability, workers compensation, and other personal injury matters disclosed in the company’s 2022 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated insurance recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. 16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company initially measures the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on amounts expected to be transferred (probability-weighted) discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. In the six months ended July 1, 2023, the company recorded $ 44 million, of net losses on investments, which are included in other income/(expense) in the accompanying statements of income. In the three and six months ended July 2, 2022, the company recorded $ 17 million and $( 122 ) million, respectively, of net gains (losses) on investments, which are included in other income/(expense) in the accompanying statements of income. The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs (such as likelihood of achieving production or revenue milestones, as well as changes in the fair values of the investments underlying a recapitalization investment portfolio), of the contingent consideration.

The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity.

Restructuring and Other Costs In the first six months of 2023, restructuring and other costs primarily included continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, impairment of long-lived assets, and, to a lesser extent, net charges for pre-acquisition litigation and other matters. In 2023, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected approximately 3 % of the company’s workforce. As of August 4, 2023, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $ 85 million, primarily in 2023, and expects to identify additional actions in future periods which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), are made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding: projections of revenues, expenses, earnings, margins, tax rates, tax provisions, cash flows, pension and benefit obligations and funding requirements, and our liquidity position; cost reductions, restructuring activities, new product and service developments, competitive strengths or market position, acquisitions or divestitures; growth, declines and other trends in markets we sell into; new or modified laws, regulations and accounting pronouncements; outstanding claims, legal proceedings, tax audits and assessments and other contingent liabilities; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; general economic and capital markets conditions; the timing of any of the foregoing; assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; the COVID-19 pandemic; and any other statements that address events or developments that Thermo Fisher intends or believes will or may occur in the future. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements are accompanied by such words. While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the company’s estimates change, and readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing the company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this report. A number of important factors could cause the results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the caption “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (which is on file with the SEC). Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties relating to: the COVID-19 pandemic; the need to develop new products and adapt to significant technological change; implementation of strategies for improving growth; general economic conditions and related uncertainties; dependence on customers’ capital spending policies and government funding policies; the effect of economic and political conditions and exchange rate fluctuations on international operations; use and protection of intellectual property; the effect of changes in governmental regulations; any natural disaster, public health crisis or other catastrophic event; and the effect of laws and regulations governing government contracts, as well as the possibility that expected benefits related to recent or pending acquisitions may not materialize as expected. The company refers to various amounts or measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to their most directly comparable amount or measure under the section “ Non-GAAP Measures ” later in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Overview Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies.

The biosciences and bioproduction businesses have expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they have expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, our pharma services business has provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. These positive impacts are expected to continue at much lower levels in 2023 as customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand declines. Sales of products related to COVID-19 testing were $0.08 billion and $0.63 billion in the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $0.22 billion and $2.31 billion in the first six months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the second quarter of 2023, growth was flat from pharma and biotech customers driven by lower demand associated with COVID-19 vaccine and therapies, the impact on customers from a more challenging macroeconomic environment and the slow economic recovery in China. We saw very strong growth across the academic and government market with great customer adoption of our high-impact innovation. The industrial and applied market grew slightly, driven by continued strong demand for our analytical instruments serving our semiconductor and materials science customers, partially offset by the impact of a slow economic recovery in China. The diagnostics and healthcare market declined due to decreased demand for COVID-19 testing products. During the second quarter of 2023, sales growth in North America and Asia Pacific declined, while Europe grew slightly. Sales growth in all regions was impacted by decreased demand in 2023 for COVID-19 related products and the impact on customers from a more challenging macroeconomic environment. Asia Pacific was impacted by the slow economic recovery in China. Contributions to organic revenue during the second quarter of 2023 from the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services and Analytical Instruments segments were more than offset by declines in the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments. During the first six months of 2023, we saw good demand from pharma and biotech customers driven by our trusted partner status, partially offset by the impact on customers from a more challenging macroeconomic environment. We saw broad based strength across the academic and government market. The industrial and applied market was strong, driven by continued strong demand for our analytical instruments serving our semiconductor and materials science customers. The diagnostics and healthcare market declined due to decreased demand for COVID-19 testing products. During the first six months of 2023, sales growth in all major regions declined due to decreased demand for COVID-19 related products. Contributions to organic revenue during the first six months of 2023 from the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services and Analytical Instruments segments were more than offset by declines in the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments. The company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars: • High-impact innovation, • Our trusted partner status with customers, and • Our unparalleled commercial engine. GAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 due primarily to lower COVID-19 related revenue, strategic growth investments and effects of currency translation. This was partially offset by strong productivity improvements and strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. GAAP operating income margin in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 was also impacted by restructuring and other charges incurred for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations and limit the impact of expected lower revenue (Note 9). The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing 23 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Notable Recent Acquisitions On January 3, 2023, the company acquired, within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, The Binding Site Group, a U.K.-based provider of specialty diagnostic assays and instruments to improve the diagnosis and management of blood cancers and immune system disorders. The acquisition expands the segment’s portfolio with the addition of pioneering innovation in diagnostics and monitoring for multiple myeloma. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits as defined in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2022.

See additional discussion under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. GAAP other income/(expense) and adjusted other income/(expense) includes currency transaction gains, losses on non-operating monetary assets and liabilities, and net periodic pension benefit cost/income, excluding the service cost component. GAAP other income/(expense) in the first six months of 2023 also includes $43 million of net losses on investments. GAAP other income/(expense) in the second quarter and first six months of 2022 also includes $18 million and $(123) million, respectively, of net gains/(losses) on investments. GAAP other income/expense in the first six months of 2022 also includes $26 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 7). The company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to tax planning initiatives, including a tax benefit of $91 million, net of related tax expenses, from a foreign exchange loss on an intercompany debt refinancing transaction in the second quarter of 2023, as well as a $144 million tax benefit resulting from a capital loss generated in the first quarter of 2023 as part of an intra-entity transaction. The GAAP and adjusted tax rates in 2023 were also impacted, to a lesser extent, by a decrease in pre-tax earnings compared to 2022. The company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates in 2022 were impacted by releases of valuation allowances of $88 million and $175 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2022, respectively, in jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are now expected to be realized. The effective tax rates in both 2023 and 2022 were also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total approximately $1.40 billion in 2023. 26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. The company expects its GAAP effective tax rate in 2023 will be between 5% and 7% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. The company expects its adjusted tax rate will be approximately 10% in 2023. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 70 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Weighted average diluted shares decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to share repurchases, net of option dilution. Liquidity and Capital Resources The company’s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets. The company deploys its capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends. (In millions) July 1, 2023 December 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,133 $ 8,524 Total debt 34,008 34,488 Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions, capacity expansion, and repayment of third-party foreign debt by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. As of July 1, 2023, the company’s short-term debt totaled $4.81 billion. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 7). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of July 1, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit. Six months ended (In millions) July 1, 2023 July 2, 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,269 $ 3,730 Net cash used in investing activities (3,585) (1,089) Net cash used in financing activities (4,049) (5,050) Free cash flow (non-GAAP measure) 1,537 2,598 Operating Activities During the first six months of 2023, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $1.50 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $0.87 billion. Cash payments for income taxes were $0.78 billion during the first six months of 2023. During the first six months of 2022, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. An increase in inventories used cash of $0.87 billion, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $0.74 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation. Cash payments for income taxes were $0.83 billion during the first six months of 2022. 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Investing Activities During the first six months of 2023, acquisitions used cash of $2.75 billion. The company’s investing activities also included purchases of $0.74 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. During the first six months of 2022, acquisitions used cash of $0.04 billion. The company’s investing activities also included purchases of $1.15 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. The company expects that for all of 2023, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be approximately $1.7 billion. Financing Activities During the first six months of 2023, repayment of senior notes used cash of $1.00 billion. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock (5.2 million shares) and the payment of $0.25 billion in cash dividends. On November 10, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.00 billion of the company’s common stock. All of the shares of common stock repurchased by the company during the first quarter of 2023 were under this program. At August 4, 2023, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. During the first six months of 2022, repayment of senior notes and net commercial paper activity used cash of $0.38 billion and $2.46 billion, respectively. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock (3.3 million shares) and the payment of $0.22 billion in cash dividends. The company’s commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially subsequent to July 1, 2023, except for the agreement to acquire CorEvitas, LLC. Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company’s short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods. We report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company’s core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable: • Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs. • Costs/income associated with restructuring activities and large-scale abandonments of product lines, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities and large-scale abandonment of product lines are not indicative of our normal operating costs. • Equity in earnings/losses of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. • The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. • The tax impacts of the above items and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as changes in deferred taxes from enacted tax rate/law changes), the latter of which we exclude because they are outside of our normal operations and difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We report free cash flow, which is operating cash flow excluding net capital expenditures, to provide a view of the continuing operations’ ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. The company also uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. The non-GAAP financial measures of the company’s results of operations and cash flows included in this Form 10-Q are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for the company’s results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth within the “Overview” and “Results of Operations” sections and below.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Interim Financial Statements The interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared by the company, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position at April 1, 2023, the results of operations for the three-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, and the cash flows for the three-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain all information that is included in the annual financial statements and notes thereto of the company. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the 2022 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2022 describes the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes in the company’s significant accounting policies during the three months ended April 1, 2023. Inventories The components of inventories are as follows: (In millions) April 1, 2023 December 31, 2022 Raw materials $ 2,416 $ 2,405 Work in process 708 660 Finished goods 2,540 2,569 Inventories $ 5,664 $ 5,634 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company’s estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. The negative impacts associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic significantly lessened in 2022 and 2023. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which may include inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, are uncertain and may require changes to estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2022, the FASB issued new guidance to require entities to disclose information about supplier finance programs. Among other things, the new guidance requires expanded disclosure about key program terms, payment terms, and amounts outstanding for obligations under these programs for each period presented. The company adopted some aspects of this guidance in 2023 using a retrospective method and will adopt other aspects in 2024 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the company’s disclosures; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of arrangements of this nature entered into by the company. In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance to require entities to disclose information about certain types of government assistance they receive, including cash grants and tax credits. Among other things, the new guidance requires expanded disclosure regarding the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the nature, amount, timing, and significant terms and 8 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) conditions of transactions with a government arising from a grant or other forms of assistance accounted for under a contribution model. The company adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2022 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. Note 2. Acquisitions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses and the benefits that will be gained from the assembled workforces. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products and services; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products and services. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. 2023 On January 3, 2023, the company acquired, within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, The Binding Site Group, a U.K.-based provider of specialty diagnostic assays and instruments to improve the diagnosis and management of blood cancers and immune system disorders. The acquisition expands the segment’s portfolio with the addition of pioneering innovation in diagnostics and monitoring for multiple myeloma. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not expected to be tax deductible. The components of the purchase price and net assets acquired are as follows: (In millions) The Binding Site Purchase price Cash paid $ 2,416 Debt settled 307 Cash acquired ( 19 ) $ 2,704 Net assets acquired Definite-lived intangible assets: Customer relationships $ 868 Product technology 173 Tradenames 42 Goodwill 1,758 Net tangible assets 142 Deferred tax assets (liabilities) ( 279 ) $ 2,704 The weighted-average amortization period for definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2023 are 18 years for customer relationships, 15 years for product technology and 15 years for tradenames. The weighted average amortization period for all definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2023 is 17 years. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the acquisition of The Binding Site is based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and is subject to adjustment upon finalization, largely with respect to acquired intangible assets and the related deferred taxes. Measurements of these items inherently require significant estimates and assumptions. 9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 3.

See Note 10 for fair value information pertaining to the company’s long-term borrowings. Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility (the Facility) with a bank group that provides for up to $ 5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The Facility expires on January 7, 2027. The revolving credit agreement calls for interest at either a Term SOFR, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of April 1, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of April 1, 2023, there were $ 0.82 billion of outstanding borrowings under these programs. Senior Notes Interest is payable quarterly on the floating rate senior notes, annually on the euro-denominated fixed rate senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the fixed rate senior notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. Except for the euro-denominated floating rate senior notes, which may not be redeemed early, the floating rate senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part on or after their applicable call dates at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. The company was in compliance with all covenants at April 1, 2023. In the first quarter of 2022, the company redeemed all of its 3.650 % Senior Notes due 2025. In connection with the redemption, the company incurred $ 26 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in other income/(expense) on the accompanying statements of income. 14 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V. (Thermo Fisher International), a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued each of the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00 % Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00 % Senior Notes due 2025, the 0.80 % Senior Notes due 2030, the 1.125 % Senior Notes due 2033, the 1.625 % Senior Notes due 2041, and the 2.00 % Senior Notes due 2051 included in the table above (collectively, the “Euronotes”) in registered public offerings. The company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of Thermo Fisher International’s obligations under the Euronotes and all of Thermo Fisher International’s other debt securities, and no other subsidiary of the company will guarantee these obligations. Thermo Fisher International is a “finance subsidiary” as defined in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of the Exchange Act, with no assets or operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Euronotes and other debt securities issued by Thermo Fisher International from time to time. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Thermo Fisher International are consolidated in the financial statements of the company. Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. At April 1, 2023, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending environmental-related matters disclosed in the company’s 2022 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies The company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The disputes and litigation matters include product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed in the company’s 2022 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more such matters could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters The company is involved in various proceedings and litigation that arise from time to time in connection with product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters. At April 1, 2023, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending product liability, workers compensation, and other personal injury matters disclosed in the company’s 2022 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated insurance recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company initially measures the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on amounts expected to be transferred (probability-weighted) discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. In the first three months ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, the company recorded $ 44 million and $ 139 million, respectively, of net losses on investments, which are included in other income/(expense) in the accompanying statements of income. The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs (such as likelihood of achieving production or revenue milestones, as well as changes in the fair values of the investments underlying a recapitalization investment portfolio), of the contingent consideration.

The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt, certain foreign-denominated payables, and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes, certain foreign-denominated payables, and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and certain foreign-denominated payables, and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity.

Note 12. Restructuring and Other Costs In the first three months of 2023, restructuring and other costs primarily included impairment of long-lived assets, net charges for pre-acquisition litigation and other matters, and continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations. In 2023, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected less than 2 % of the company’s workforce. As of May 5, 2023, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $ 125 million, primarily in 2023, and expects to identify additional actions in future periods which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), are made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding: projections of revenues, expenses, earnings, margins, tax rates, tax provisions, cash flows, pension and benefit obligations and funding requirements, and our liquidity position; cost reductions, restructuring activities, new product and service developments, competitive strengths or market position, acquisitions or divestitures; growth, declines and other trends in markets we sell into; new or modified laws, regulations and accounting pronouncements; outstanding claims, legal proceedings, tax audits and assessments and other contingent liabilities; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; general economic and capital markets conditions; the timing of any of the foregoing; assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s business; and any other statements that address events or developments that Thermo Fisher intends or believes will or may occur in the future. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements are accompanied by such words. While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the company’s estimates change, and readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing the company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this report. A number of important factors could cause the results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the caption “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (which is on file with the SEC). Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties relating to: the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; the need to develop new products and adapt to significant technological change; implementation of strategies for improving growth; general economic conditions and related uncertainties; dependence on customers’ capital spending policies and government funding policies; the effect of economic and political conditions and exchange rate fluctuations on international operations; use and protection of intellectual property; the effect of changes in governmental regulations; any natural disaster, public health crisis or other catastrophic event; and the effect of laws and regulations governing government contracts, as well as the possibility that expected benefits related to recent or pending acquisitions may not materialize as expected. The company refers to various amounts or measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to their most directly comparable amount or measure under the section “ Non-GAAP Measures ” later in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Overview Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. The company’s operations fall into four segments (Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services.

The biosciences and bioproduction businesses have expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they have expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, our pharma services business has provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. These positive impacts are expected to continue at much lower levels in 2023 as customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand declines. Sales of products related to COVID-19 testing were $141 million and $1.68 billion in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the first quarter of 2023, we saw good demand from pharma and biotech customers driven by our trusted partner status. We saw broad based strength across the academic and government market. The industrial and applied market was strong, driven by continued strong demand for our analytical instruments serving our semiconductor and materials science customers. The diagnostics and healthcare market declined due to decreased demand for COVID-19 testing products. During the first quarter of 2023, sales growth in North America and Europe declined, while Asia Pacific grew slightly. Sales growth in all regions was impacted by decreased demand in 2023 for COVID-19 related products. Contributions to organic revenue during the first quarter of 2023 from the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services and Analytical Instruments segments were more than offset by declines in the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments. The company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars: • Developing high-impact, innovative new products, • Leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets, and • Delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. GAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin decreased in the first quarter of 2023 due primarily to lower COVID-19 related volumes, unfavorable business mix and strategic growth investments. This was partially offset by strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation while also driving strong productivity. GAAP operating income margin in the first quarter of 2023 was also impacted by restructuring and other charges incurred for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations (Note 9), as well as the impact of fixed intangible amortization expense on lower revenues. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Notable Recent Acquisitions On January 3, 2023, the company acquired, within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, The Binding Site Group, a U.K.-based provider of specialty diagnostic assays and instruments to improve the diagnosis and management of blood cancers and immune system disorders. The acquisition expands the segment’s portfolio with the addition of pioneering innovation in diagnostics and monitoring for multiple myeloma. 22 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits as defined in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2022. Accordingly, the following segment data are reported on this basis. Three months ended April 1, April 2, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $ 2,612 $ 4,231 Analytical Instruments 1,723 1,518 Specialty Diagnostics 1,108 1,482 Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services 5,763 5,442 Eliminations (496) (855) Consolidated revenues $ 10,710 $ 11,818 Life Sciences Solutions Three months ended Organic* (non-GAAP measure) (Dollars in millions) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 Total Change Currency Translation Acquisitions/ Divestitures Revenues $ 2,612 $ 4,231 (38) % (2) % — % (37) % Segment income 836 2,176 (62) % Segment income margin 32.0 % 51.4 % -19.4 pt The decrease in organic revenues in the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to lower revenue in the genetic sciences and biosciences businesses, driven by moderation in COVID-19 related revenue. The decrease in segment income margin resulted primarily from unfavorable business mix and significantly lower COVID-19 related revenue. These decreases were partially offset by strong productivity. Analytical Instruments Three months ended Organic* (non-GAAP measure) (Dollars in millions) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 Total Change Currency Translation Acquisitions/ Divestitures Revenues $ 1,723 $ 1,518 14 % (3) % — % 17 % Segment income 421 301 40 % Segment income margin 24.4 % 19.8 % 4.6 pt The increase in organic revenues in the first quarter of 2023 was driven by increased demand across each of the segment’s businesses, with particular strength in the chromatography and mass spectrometry and electron microscopy businesses. The increase in segment income margin resulted primarily from profit on higher sales, strong productivity improvements, and favorable business mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments. Specialty Diagnostics Three months ended Organic* (non-GAAP measure) (Dollars in millions) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 Total Change Currency Translation Acquisitions/ Divestitures Revenues $ 1,108 $ 1,482 (25) % (1) % 4 % (28) % Segment income 280 353 (21) % Segment income margin 25.3 % 23.9 % 1.4 pt The decrease in organic revenues in the first quarter of 2023 was due to decreased demand, primarily driven by products addressing diagnosis of COVID-19, partially offset by growth in the immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. The impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume on segment income margin was partially offset by favorable business mix and strong productivity improvements. 23 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services Three months ended Organic* (non-GAAP measure) (Dollars in millions) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 Total Change Currency Translation Acquisitions/ Divestitures Revenues $ 5,763 $ 5,442 6 % (1) % — % 7 % Segment income 793 620 28 % Segment income margin 13.8 % 11.4 % 2.4 pt The increase in organic revenues in the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to higher sales in the pharma services and clinical research businesses. The increase in segment income margin was primarily due to profit on higher sales and productivity improvements, partially offset by strategic growth investments. * Results may not sum due to rounding Non-operating Items Three months ended April 1, April 2, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Net interest expense $ 154 $ 118 GAAP other income/(expense) (46) (163) Adjusted other income/(expense) (non-GAAP measure) — 4 GAAP tax rate 3.4 % 11.9 % Adjusted tax rate (non-GAAP measure) 10.0 % 14.1 % Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) increased due primarily to the company’s capital deployment initiatives, which included financing stock buybacks and the acquisition of The Binding Site Group (Note 2). See additional discussion under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. GAAP other income/(expense) and adjusted other income/(expense) includes currency transaction gains, losses on non-operating monetary assets and liabilities, and net periodic pension benefit cost/income, excluding the service cost component. GAAP other income/(expense) in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 also includes $43 million and $141 million, respectively, of net losses on investments. GAAP other income/expense in 2022 also includes $26 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 7). The company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates decreased in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to tax planning initiatives, which included a $144 million tax benefit resulting from a capital loss generated as part of an intra-entity transaction in the first quarter of 2023. The company’s 2022 GAAP and adjusted tax rates were impacted by the release of an $82 million valuation allowance in a jurisdiction where the deferred tax assets are now expected to be realized. The effective tax rates in both the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 were also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total approximately $1.40 billion in 2023. The company expects its GAAP effective tax rate in 2023 will be between 6% and 8% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. The company expects its adjusted tax rate will be approximately 11% in 2023. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 70 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources The company’s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets. The company deploys its capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends. 24 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. (In millions) April 1, 2023 December 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,482 $ 8,524 Total debt 35,257 34,488 Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions, capacity expansion, and repayment of third-party foreign debt by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. As of April 1, 2023, the company’s short-term debt totaled $6.12 billion. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 7). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of April 1, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit. Three months ended (In millions) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 729 $ 2,202 Net cash used in investing activities (3,142) (670) Net cash used in financing activities (2,593) (3,145) Free cash flow (non-GAAP measure) 277 1,564 Operating Activities During the first three months of 2023, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $1.32 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes were $0.57 billion during the first three months of 2023. During the first three months of 2022, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. An increase in inventories used cash of $0.50 billion, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $0.36 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation. Cash payments for income taxes were $0.30 billion during the first three months of 2022. Investing Activities During the first three months of 2023, acquisitions used cash of $2.70 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $0.46 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. During the first three months of 2022, acquisitions used cash of $0.04 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $0.64 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. Financing Activities During the first three months of 2023 net commercial paper activity used cash of $0.50 billion. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock (5.2 million shares) and the payment of $0.12 billion in cash dividends. On November 10, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.00 billion of the company’s common stock. All of the shares of common stock repurchased by the company during the first quarter of 2023 were under this program. At May 5, 2023, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. During the first three months of 2022 repayment of senior notes and net commercial paper activity used cash of $0.38 billion and $0.63 billion, respectively. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock (3.3 million shares) and the payment of $0.10 billion in cash dividends. The company’s commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially subsequent to April 1, 2023. The company expects that for all of 2023, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be approximately $2.0 billion. 25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company’s short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods. We report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company’s core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable: • Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs. • Costs/income associated with restructuring activities and large-scale abandonments of product lines, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities and large-scale abandonment of product lines are not indicative of our normal operating costs. • Equity in earnings/losses of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. • The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. • The tax impacts of the above items and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as changes in deferred taxes from enacted tax rate/law changes), the latter of which we exclude because they are outside of our normal operations and difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We report free cash flow, which is operating cash flow excluding net capital expenditures, to provide a view of the continuing operations’ ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. The company also uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. The non-GAAP financial measures of the company’s results of operations and cash flows included in this Form 10-Q are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for the company’s results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth within the “Overview” and “Results of Operations” sections and below.

(c) Adjusted results in 2023 and 2022 exclude restructuring and other costs consisting principally of severance, impairments of long-lived assets, abandoned facility and other expenses of headcount reductions and real estate consolidations. Adjusted results in 2023 also exclude $18 million of net charges for pre-acquisition litigation and other matters. (d) Adjusted results in 2023 and 2022 exclude net gains/losses on investments. Adjusted results in 2022 also exclude $26 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt. (e) Adjusted provision for income taxes in 2023 and 2022 excludes incremental tax impacts for the reconciling items between GAAP and adjusted net income, incremental tax impacts as a result of tax rate/law changes and the tax impacts from audit settlements.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Interim Financial Statements The interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared by the company, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position at October 1, 2022, the results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, and the cash flows for the nine-month periods ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2021 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain all information that is included in the annual financial statements and notes thereto of the company. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the 2021 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2021 describes the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes in the company’s significant accounting policies during the nine months ended October 1, 2022. Inventories The components of inventories are as follows: (In millions) October 1, 2022 December 31, 2021 Raw materials $ 2,405 $ 1,922 Work in process 677 676 Finished goods 2,640 2,453 Inventories $ 5,722 $ 5,051 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company’s estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. The negative impacts associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic significantly lessened in 2021 and 2022. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which may include inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, are uncertain and may require changes to estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance to require entities to disclose information about certain types of government assistance they receive, including cash grants and tax credits. Among other things, the new guidance requires expanded disclosure regarding the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the nature, amount, timing, and significant terms and conditions of transactions with a government arising from a grant or other forms of assistance accounted for under a contribution model. The company will adopt this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2022 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of transactions of this nature entered into by the company. In September 2022, the FASB issued new guidance to require entities to disclose information about supplier finance programs. Among other things, the new guidance requires expanded disclosure about key program terms, payment terms, and amounts outstanding for obligations under these programs for each period presented. The company will adopt some aspects of this guidance in 2023 using a retrospective method and other aspects in 2024 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of arrangements of this nature entered into by the company. Note 2. Acquisitions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses and the benefits that will be gained from the assembled workforces. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products and services; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products and services. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Pending Acquisition The company has entered into an agreement to acquire The Binding Site Group for £ 2.25 billion, payable as € 2.59 billion in cash. The Binding Site Group provides specialty diagnostic assays and instruments to improve the diagnosis and management of blood cancers and immune system disorders. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Upon completion, The Binding Site Group will become part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. 2022 In 2022, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a U.S.-based developer of Fourier-transform infrared gas analysis technologies. 2021 The preliminary allocations of the purchase price for the acquisitions of PPD, Inc. and PeproTech, Inc. were based on estimates of the fair values of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization, largely with respect to acquired intangible assets, lease assets and liabilities, and the related deferred taxes. Measurements of these items inherently require significant estimates and assumptions. During the first nine months of 2022, the company adjusted the preliminary allocations of PPD and PeproTech, which among others increased goodwill ($ 122 million) and other liabilities assumed ($ 35 million), and decreased definite-lived intangible assets ($ 43 million), property, plant and equipment ($ 39 million), other current assets ($ 38 million), contract liabilities ($ 29 million), equity method investments ($ 23 million), and the fair value of assumed contingent consideration ($ 18 million). The adjustments to depreciation and amortization expenses recorded during the first nine months of 2022 were not material. 10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company recorded a $ 208 million net tax benefit primarily from this settlement and related impacts, which resulted in a decrease in the company’s unrecognized tax benefits of $ 658 million. The company recorded $ 49 million of charges for expired tax credits and other related components of the settlement. The company recorded a charge of $ 395 million to establish a valuation allowance against certain U.S. foreign tax credits which the company believes will more likely than not expire unutilized. The company also recorded $ 101 million of additional net unrecognized tax benefit liabilities related to other tax audits. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 70 countries outside the U.S. The company's effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate each year due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives, state and local taxes, and foreign taxes that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of October 1, 2022 the company had $ 0.56 billion of unrecognized tax benefits substantially all of which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.

See Note 10 for fair value information pertaining to the company’s long-term borrowings. Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility (the Facility) with a bank group that provides for up to $ 5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The Facility expires on January 7, 2027. The revolving credit agreement calls for interest at either a Term SOFR, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of October 1, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of October 1, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under these programs. Senior Notes Interest is payable quarterly on the floating rate senior notes, annually on the euro-denominated fixed rate senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the fixed rate senior notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. Except for the euro-denominated floating rate senior notes, which may not be redeemed early, the floating rate senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part on or after their applicable call dates at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The company is subject 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. The company was in compliance with all covenants at October 1, 2022. In the first quarter of 2022, the company redeemed all of its 3.650 % Senior Notes due 2025. In connection with the redemption, the company incurred $ 26 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in other income/(expense) on the accompanying statement of income. Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V. (Thermo Fisher International), a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued each of the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00 % Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00 % Senior Notes due 2025, the 0.80 % Senior Notes due 2030, the 1.125 % Senior Notes due 2033, the 1.625 % Senior Notes due 2041, and the 2.00 % Senior Notes due 2051 included in the table above (collectively, the “Euronotes”) in registered public offerings. The company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of Thermo Fisher International’s obligations under the Euronotes and all of Thermo Fisher International’s other debt securities, and no other subsidiary of the company will guarantee these obligations. Thermo Fisher International is a “finance subsidiary” as defined in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of the Exchange Act, with no assets or operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Euronotes and other debt securities issued by Thermo Fisher International from time to time. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Thermo Fisher International are consolidated in the financial statements of the company.

Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. At October 1, 2022, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending environmental-related matters disclosed in the company’s 2021 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies The company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The disputes and litigation matters include product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed in the company’s 2021 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that 16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters The company is involved in various proceedings and litigation that arise from time to time in connection with product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters. At October 1, 2022, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending product liability, workers compensation, and other personal injury matters disclosed in the company’s 2021 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated insurance recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. Note 9.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company initially measures the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on amounts expected to be transferred (probability-weighted) discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. In the three and nine months ended October 1, 2022, the company recorded $ 13 million and $ 136 million, respectively, of net losses on investments which are included in other income/(expense) in the accompanying statement of income. In the three and nine months ended October 2, 2021, the company recorded $ 25 million and $ 23 million, respectively, of net gains on investments which are included in other income/(expense) in the accompanying statement of income. 18 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt, certain foreign-denominated payables, and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes, certain foreign-denominated payables, and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and certain foreign-denominated payables, and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity.

The biosciences and bioproduction businesses have expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they have expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, our pharma services business has provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2022, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Sales of products related to COVID-19 testing were $0.44 billion and $1.57 billion in the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $2.75 billion and $5.44 billion in the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, demand from pharma and biotech customers was very strong, driven by our unique value proposition and trusted partner status. We saw growth in the academic and government market as we remain well positioned to meet customer needs. The industrial and applied market was strong, driven by robust demand for our analytical instruments. The diagnostics and healthcare market declined due to decreased demand for COVID-19 testing products. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, strong sales growth in North America and the Asia Pacific region, including China, was partially offset by a decline in COVID-19 testing demand. In Europe, sales declined during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 due to lower COVID-19 testing demand. Contributions to organic revenue during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 were driven by the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services and Analytical Instruments segments, as offset by the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments. The company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars: • Developing high-impact, innovative new products, • Leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets, and • Delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. GAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 due primarily to lower COVID-19 testing volumes, continued strategic growth investments, and the expected impact of incorporating recent acquisitions. This was partially offset by strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation while also driving strong productivity. GAAP operating income margin in 2022 was also impacted by higher amortization expense as a result of 2021 acquisitions. 24 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Notable Recent Acquisitions On January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, the Belgium-based European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS for $0.83 billion in net cash consideration. The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers. The acquisition expands the segment’s capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies. On February 25, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Mesa Biotech, Inc., a U.S.-based molecular diagnostic company, for $0.41 billion in net cash consideration and contingent consideration with an initial fair value of $0.06 billion due upon the completion of certain milestones. Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a PCR based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19. The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care. On September 30, 2021, the company assumed operating responsibility, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, of a new state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland from CSL Limited to perform pharma services for CSL with capacity to serve other customers as well. The company expects to make fixed lease payments aggregating to $0.56 billion (excluding renewals) from 2021 to 2041, with additional amounts dependent on the extent of revenues from customers of the facility other than CSL. On December 8, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, PPD, Inc., a U.S.-based global provider of clinical research services to the pharma and biotech industry, for $15.99 billion in net cash consideration and $0.04 billion of equity awards exchanged. The addition of PPD’s clinical research services enhances our offering to biotech and pharma customers by enabling them to accelerate innovation and increase their productivity within the drug development process. In 2020, PPD generated revenues of $4.68 billion. On December 30, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, PeproTech, Inc., a U.S. based developer and manufacturer of recombinant proteins, for $1.86 billion in net cash consideration. PeproTech provides bioscience reagents known as recombinant proteins, including cytokines and growth factors. The acquisition expands the segment’s bioscience offerings. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits as defined in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2021.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Non-operating Items Three months ended Nine months ended October 1, October 2, October 1, October 2, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net interest expense $ 105 $ 119 $ 335 $ 343 GAAP other income/(expense) (4) 18 (139) (168) Adjusted other income/(expense) (non-GAAP measure) 10 13 24 32 GAAP tax rate 1.9 % 12.4 % 8.8 % 13.0 % Adjusted tax rate (non-GAAP measure) 11.8 % 14.2 % 13.1 % 14.9 % Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) decreased due primarily to lower average interest rates on debt and higher average interest rates on cash balances, partially offset by the increase in debt to finance the acquisition of PPD and for general corporate purposes. See additional discussion under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. GAAP other income/(expense) and adjusted other income/(expense) includes currency transaction gains, losses on non-operating monetary assets and liabilities, and net periodic pension benefit cost/income, excluding the service cost component. GAAP other income/(expense) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 also includes $12 million and $135 million, respectively, of net losses on investments. GAAP other income/(expense) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 also includes $25 million and $23 million, respectively, of net gains on investments. In the first nine months of 2022 and 2021 GAAP other income/(expense) also includes $26 million and $197 million, respectively, of losses on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 7). The company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to releases of valuation allowances of $189 million in the first nine months of 2022 in jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are now expected to be realized. The company’s 2022 GAAP tax rate was also impacted by changes in tax rates and higher amortization expense as a result of 2021 acquisitions, as well as a net benefit of $208 million resulting from tax audit settlements in the third quarter of 2022 (see Note 5). During the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 the company recorded income tax benefits on intra-entity transactions of $96 million and $258 million, respectively. The effective tax rates in both 2022 and 2021 were also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total approximately $1.35 billion in 2022. The company expects its GAAP effective tax rate in 2022 will be between 8% and 10% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. The company expects its adjusted tax rate will be between 13% and 13.5% in 2022. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 70 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources The company’s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets. The company deploys its capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends. (In millions) October 1, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,919 $ 4,477 Total debt 29,160 34,870 Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions, capacity expansion, and repayment of third-party foreign debt by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. As of October 1, 2022, the company’s short-term debt totaled $1.01 billion. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 7). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of October 1, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit. Nine months ended (In millions) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,667 $ 6,855 Net cash used in investing activities (1,634) (3,240) Net cash used in financing activities (5,201) (1,886) Free cash flow (non-GAAP measure) 3,992 5,172 Operating Activities During the first nine months of 2022, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. An increase in inventories used cash of $1.12 billion, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $0.73 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation. Cash payments for income taxes were $1.05 billion during the first nine months of 2022. During the first nine months of 2021, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. An increase in inventories used cash of $0.92 billion, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $0.58 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes were $1.56 billion during the first nine months of 2021. Investing Activities During the first nine months of 2022, acquisitions used cash of $0.04 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $1.69 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. During the first nine months of 2021, acquisitions used cash of $1.52 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $1.69 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. Financing Activities During the first nine months of 2022, repayment of senior notes and net commercial paper activity used cash of $0.38 billion and $2.46 billion, respectively. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock (3.3 million shares) and the payment of $0.34 billion in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $1.00 billion of the company’s common stock (2.0 million shares), depleting the 2021 authorization. As discussed in Note 7, in October 2022 the company issued senior notes for net proceeds of $735 million. During the first nine months of 2021 repayment of senior notes used cash of $2.80 billion. Issuance of debt provided $3.12 billion of cash. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $0.29 billion in cash dividends. The company’s commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially subsequent to December 31, 2021, except for the agreement to acquire The Binding Site Group. The company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.3 and $2.5 billion. 29 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company’s short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods. We report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company’s core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable: • Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs. • Costs/income associated with restructuring activities and large-scale abandonments of product lines, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities and large-scale abandonment of product lines are not indicative of our normal operating costs. • Equity in earnings/losses of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. • The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. • The tax impacts of the above items and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as changes in deferred taxes from enacted tax rate/law changes), the latter of which we exclude because they are outside of our normal operations and difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We report free cash flow, which is operating cash flow excluding net capital expenditures, to provide a view of the continuing operations’ ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. The company also uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. The non-GAAP financial measures of the company’s results of operations and cash flows included in this Form 10-Q are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for the company’s results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth within the “Overview” and “Results of Operations” sections and below. 30 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Interim Financial Statements The interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared by the company, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position at July 2, 2022, the results of operations for the three- and six-month periods ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021, and the cash flows for the six-month periods ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2021, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain all information that is included in the annual financial statements and notes thereto of the company. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the 2021 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2021 describes the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes in the company’s significant accounting policies during the six months ended July 2, 2022. Inventories The components of inventories are as follows: July 2, December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Raw materials $ 2,335 $ 1,922 Work in process 699 676 Finished goods 2,634 2,453 Inventories $ 5,668 $ 5,051 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company’s estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. The negative impacts associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic significantly lessened in 2021 and 2022. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which may include inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, are uncertain and may require changes to estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance to require entities to disclose information about certain types of government assistance they receive, including cash grants and tax credits. Among other things, the new guidance requires expanded disclosure regarding the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the nature, amount, timing, and significant terms and conditions of transactions with a government arising from a grant or other forms of assistance accounted for under a contribution model. The company will adopt this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2022 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of transactions of this nature entered into by the company. 9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 2. Acquisitions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses and the benefits that will be gained from the assembled workforces. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products and services; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products and services. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. 2022 In 2022, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a U.S.-based developer of Fourier-transform infrared gas analysis technologies. 2021 The preliminary allocations of the purchase price for the acquisitions of the Lengnau biologics manufacturing facility, PPD, Inc. and PeproTech, Inc. were based on estimates of the fair values of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization, largely with respect to acquired intangible assets, lease assets and liabilities, and the related deferred taxes. Measurements of these items inherently require significant estimates and assumptions. During the first six months of 2022, the company adjusted the preliminary allocations of PPD and PeproTech, which among others increased goodwill ($ 95 million) and other liabilities assumed ($ 22 million), and decreased definite-lived intangible assets ($ 43 million), other current assets ($ 34 million), contract liabilities ($ 29 million), equity method investments ($ 23 million), and the fair value of assumed contingent consideration ($ 18 million). The adjustment to amortization expense recorded during the first six months of 2022 was not material. Note 3.

See Note 10 for fair value information pertaining to the company’s long-term borrowings. Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility (the Facility) with a bank group that provides for up to $ 5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The Facility expires on January 7, 2027. The revolving credit agreement calls for interest at either a Term SOFR, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of July 2, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of July 2, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under these programs. Senior Notes Interest is payable quarterly on the floating rate senior notes, annually on the euro-denominated fixed rate senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the fixed rate senior notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. Except for the euro-denominated floating rate senior notes, which may not be redeemed early, the floating rate senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part on or after their applicable call dates at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which 14 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. The company was in compliance with all covenants at July 2, 2022. In the first quarter of 2022, the company redeemed all of its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025. In connection with the redemption, the company incurred $ 26 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in other income/(expense) on the accompanying statement of income. Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V. (Thermo Fisher International), a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued each of the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00% Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00% Senior Notes due 2025, the 0.80% Senior Notes due 2030, the 1.125% Senior Notes due 2033, the 1.625% Senior Notes due 2041, and the 2.00% Senior Notes due 2051 included in the table above (collectively, the “Euronotes”) in registered public offerings. The company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of Thermo Fisher International’s obligations under the Euronotes and all of Thermo Fisher International’s other debt securities, and no other subsidiary of the company will guarantee these obligations. Thermo Fisher International is a “finance subsidiary” as defined in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of the Exchange Act, with no assets or operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Euronotes and other debt securities issued by Thermo Fisher International from time to time. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Thermo Fisher International are consolidated in the financial statements of the company. Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. At July 2, 2022, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending environmental-related matters disclosed in the company’s 2021 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies The company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The disputes and litigation matters include product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed in the company’s 2021 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters The company is involved in various proceedings and litigation that arise from time to time in connection with product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters. At July 2, 2022, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending product liability, workers compensation, and other personal injury matters disclosed in the company’s 2021 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated insurance recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. Note 9.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company initially measures the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on amounts expected to be transferred (probability-weighted) discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. In the three and six months ended July 2, 2022, the company recorded $ 17 million and $( 122 ) million, respectively, of net gains (losses) on investments which are included in other income/(expense) in the accompanying statement of income. In the three and six months ended July 3, 2021, the company recorded $ 1 million and $ 2 million, respectively, of net losses on investments which are included in other income/(expense) in the accompanying statement of income.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), are made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding: projections of revenues, expenses, earnings, margins, tax rates, tax provisions, cash flows, pension and benefit obligations and funding requirements, and our liquidity position; cost reductions, restructuring activities, new product and service developments, competitive strengths or market position, acquisitions or divestitures; growth, declines and other trends in markets we sell into; new or modified laws, regulations and accounting pronouncements; outstanding claims, legal proceedings, tax audits and assessments and other contingent liabilities; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; general economic and capital markets conditions; the timing of any of the foregoing; assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s business; and any other statements that address events or developments that Thermo Fisher intends or believes will or may occur in the future. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements are accompanied by such words. While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the company’s estimates change, and readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing the company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this report. A number of important factors could cause the results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the caption “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (which is on file with the SEC). Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties relating to: the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; the need to develop new products and adapt to significant technological change; implementation of strategies for improving growth; general economic conditions and related uncertainties; dependence on customers’ capital spending policies and government funding policies; the effect of economic and political conditions and exchange rate fluctuations on international operations; use and protection of intellectual property; the effect of changes in governmental regulations; any natural disaster, public health crisis or other catastrophic event; and the effect of laws and regulations governing government contracts, as well as the possibility that expected benefits related to recent or pending acquisitions may not materialize as expected. The company refers to various amounts or measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to their most directly comparable amount or measure under the section “ Non-GAAP Measures ” later in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Overview Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies.

The biosciences and bioproduction businesses have expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they have expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, our pharma services business has provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2022, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Sales of products related to COVID-19 testing were $0.63 billion and $1.42 billion in the second quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $2.31 billion and $3.87 billion in the first six months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the second quarter and first six months of 2022, demand from biotech and pharma customers was very strong, driven by our unique value proposition and trusted partner status. We saw growth in the academic and government market as we remain well positioned to meet customer needs. The industrial and applied market was strong, led by robust demand from semiconductor and materials sciences customers. The diagnostics and healthcare market declined due to decreased demand for COVID-19 testing products. During the second quarter and first six months of 2022, sales growth was strong in the Asia Pacific region, particularly China, and in North America. Sales declined in Europe during the second quarter and first six months of 2022 due to lower COVID-19 testing demand. The company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars: • Developing high-impact, innovative new products, • Leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets, and • Delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. GAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2022 due primarily to the expected impact of incorporating recent acquisitions, lower COVID-19 testing volumes, and strategic growth investments. This was partially offset by strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. GAAP operating income margin in 2022 was also impacted by higher amortization expense as a result of 2021 acquisitions. In the second quarter of 2021, GAAP operating income margin was impacted by an impairment of acquired technology. 22 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview (continued) The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Notable Recent Acquisitions On January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, the Belgium-based European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS for $0.83 billion in net cash consideration. The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers. The acquisition expands the segment’s capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies. On February 25, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Mesa Biotech, Inc., a U.S.-based molecular diagnostic company, for $0.41 billion in net cash consideration and contingent consideration with an initial fair value of $0.06 billion due upon the completion of certain milestones. Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a PCR based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19. The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care. On September 30, 2021, the company assumed operating responsibility, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, of a new state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland from CSL Limited to perform pharma services for CSL with capacity to serve other customers as well. The company expects to make fixed lease payments aggregating to $0.56 billion (excluding renewals) from 2021 to 2041, with additional amounts dependent on the extent of revenues from customers of the facility other than CSL. On December 8, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, PPD, Inc., a U.S.-based global provider of clinical research services to the pharma and biotech industry, for $15.99 billion in net cash consideration and $0.04 billion of equity awards exchanged. The addition of PPD’s clinical research services enhances our offering to biotech and pharma customers by enabling them to accelerate innovation and increase their productivity within the drug development process. In 2020, PPD generated revenues of $4.68 billion. On December 30, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, PeproTech, Inc., a U.S. based developer and manufacturer of recombinant proteins, for $1.86 billion in net cash consideration. PeproTech provides bioscience reagents known as recombinant proteins, including cytokines and growth factors. The acquisition expands the segment’s bioscience offerings. Results of Operations The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits as defined in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2021.

The acquisition of PPD, the company’s clinical research business, contributed $1.72 billion of revenue during the second quarter. The increase in segment income margin was primarily due to strong productivity and the benefit of recent acquisitions, largely offset by strategic growth investments and unfavorable business mix.

The acquisition of PPD, the company’s clinical research business, contributed $3.38 billion of revenue during the first six months of 2022. The decrease in segment income margin was primarily due to business mix and strategic growth investments, offset in part by the benefit of recent acquisitions. * Results may not sum due to rounding 25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Non-operating Items Three months ended Six months ended July 2, July 3, July 2, July 3, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net interest expense $ 112 $ 111 $ 230 $ 224 GAAP other income/(expense) 28 (3) (135) (186) Adjusted other income/(expense) (non-GAAP measure) 10 5 14 19 GAAP tax rate 10.4 % 10.7 % 11.2 % 13.2 % Adjusted tax rate (non-GAAP measure) 13.0 % 14.0 % 13.6 % 15.1 % Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) increased due primarily to the increase in debt to finance the acquisition of PPD and for general corporate purposes, largely offset by lower average interest rates. See additional discussion under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. GAAP other income/(expense) and adjusted other income/(expense) includes currency transaction gains, losses on non-operating monetary assets and liabilities, and net periodic pension benefit cost/income, excluding the service cost component. GAAP other income/(expense) in the second quarter and first six months of 2022 includes $18 million of net gains and $123 million of net losses on investments, respectively. In the first six months of 2022 and 2021 GAAP other income/(expense) also includes $26 million and $197 million, respectively, of losses on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 7). The company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to releases of valuation allowances of $88 million and $175 million for the three and six months ended July 2, 2022, respectively, in jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are now expected to be realized. The company’s 2022 GAAP tax rate was also impacted by changes in tax rates and higher amortization expense as a result of 2021 acquisitions. In the second quarter of 2021 the company recorded a $162 million income tax benefit on an intra-entity transfer of fixed assets. The effective tax rates in both 2022 and 2021 were also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total approximately $1.35 billion in 2022. The company expects its GAAP effective tax rate in 2022 will be between 10% and 12% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. The company expects its adjusted tax rate will be between 13% and 13.5% in 2022. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 70 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources The company’s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets. The company deploys its capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends. July 2, December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,888 $ 4,477 Total debt 30,260 34,870 Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions, capacity expansion, and repayment of third-party foreign debt by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax 26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. As of July 2, 2022, the company’s short-term debt totaled $1.01 billion. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 7). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of July 2, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit. Six months ended July 2, July 3, (In millions) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,730 $ 4,205 Net cash used in investing activities (1,089) (2,624) Net cash used in financing activities (5,050) (4,926) Free cash flow (non-GAAP measure) 2,598 3,042 Operating Activities During the first six months of 2022, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. An increase in inventories used cash of $0.87 billion, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $0.74 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation. Cash payments for income taxes were $0.83 billion during the first six months of 2022. During the first six months of 2021, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. A decrease in accounts receivable provided $0.25 billion of cash. An increase in inventories used cash of $0.62 billion, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $1.06 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes were $1.27 billion during the first six months of 2021. Investing Activities During the first six months of 2022, acquisitions used cash of $0.04 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $1.15 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. During the first six months of 2021, acquisitions used cash of $1.43 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $1.17 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. Financing Activities During the first six months of 2022, repayment of senior notes and net commercial paper activity used cash of $0.38 billion and $2.46 billion, respectively. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock (3.3 million shares) and the payment of $0.22 billion in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock. At August 5, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. During the first six months of 2021 repayment of senior notes used cash of $2.80 billion. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $0.19 billion in cash dividends. The company’s commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially between December 31, 2021 and July 2, 2022. The company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion. 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company’s short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods. We report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company’s core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable: • Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs. • Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs. • Equity in earnings/losses of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. • The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. • The tax impacts of the above items and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as changes in deferred taxes from enacted tax rate/law changes), the latter of which we exclude because they are outside of our normal operations and difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We report free cash flow, which is operating cash flow excluding net capital expenditures, to provide a view of the continuing operations’ ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. The company also uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. The non-GAAP financial measures of Thermo Fisher Scientific’s results of operations and cash flows included in this Form 10-Q are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for Thermo Fisher Scientific’s results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth within the “Overview” and “Results of Operations” sections and below. 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies, and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Interim Financial Statements The interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared by the company, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position at April 2, 2022, the results of operations for the three-month periods ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, and the cash flows for the three-month periods ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2021, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain all information that is included in the annual financial statements and notes thereto of the company. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the 2021 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2021 describes the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes in the company’s significant accounting policies during the three months ended April 2, 2022. Inventories The components of inventories are as follows: April 2, December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Raw materials $ 2,135 $ 1,922 Work in process 723 676 Finished goods 2,625 2,453 Inventories $ 5,483 $ 5,051 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company’s estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. The negative impacts associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic significantly lessened in 2021 and 2022. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which may include inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, are uncertain and may require changes to estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance to require entities to disclose information about certain types of government assistance they receive, including cash grants and tax credits. Among other things, the new guidance requires expanded disclosure regarding the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the nature, amount, timing, and significant terms and conditions of transactions with a government arising from a grant or other forms of assistance accounted for under a contribution model. The company will adopt this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2022 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of transactions of this nature entered into by the company subsequent to the date of adoption. 8 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 2. Acquisitions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses and the benefits that will be gained from the assembled workforce. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. 2022 In 2022, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a U.S.-based developer of Fourier-transform infrared gas analysis technologies. 2021 The preliminary allocations of the purchase price for the acquisitions of the Lengnau biologics manufacturing facility, PPD, Inc. and PeproTech, Inc. were based on estimates of the fair values of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization, largely with respect to acquired intangible assets, lease assets and liabilities, and the related deferred taxes. Measurements of these items inherently require significant estimates and assumptions. During the first quarter of 2022, the company adjusted the preliminary allocations of PPD and PeproTech, which among others increased goodwill by $ 59 million, decreased definite-lived intangible assets by $ 43 million, decreased equity method investments by $ 23 million and decreased the fair value of assumed contingent consideration by $ 18 million. The adjustment to amortization expense recorded during the first quarter of 2022 was not material. Note 3. Revenues and Contract-related Balances Disaggregated Revenues Revenues by type are as follows: Three months ended April 2, April 3, (In millions) 2022 2021 Revenues Consumables $ 6,110 $ 5,964 Instruments 1,907 1,892 Services 3,801 2,050 Consolidated revenues $ 11,818 $ 9,906 Revenues by geographic region based on customer location are as follows: Three months ended April 2, April 3, (In millions) 2022 2021 Revenues North America $ 6,323 $ 5,101 Europe 3,050 2,785 Asia-Pacific 2,064 1,709 Other regions 381 311 Consolidated revenues $ 11,818 $ 9,906 Each reportable segment earns revenues from consumables, instruments and services in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and other regions.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Remaining Performance Obligations The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations for all open customer contracts as of April 2, 2022 was $ 28.84 billion. The company will recognize revenues for these performance obligations as they are satisfied, approximately 59 % of which is expected to occur within the next twelve months . Amounts expected to occur thereafter generally relate to contract manufacturing, clinical research and extended warranty service agreements, which typically have durations of three to five years. Contract-related Balances Noncurrent contract assets are included within other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. Noncurrent contract liabilities are included within other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet.

See Note 10 for fair value information pertaining to the company’s long-term borrowings. Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility (the Facility) with a bank group that provides for up to $ 5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The Facility expires on January 7, 2027. The revolving credit agreement calls for interest at either a Term SOFR, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of April 2, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $ 4 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of April 2, 2022, outstanding borrowings under these programs were $ 1.85 billion. Senior Notes Interest is payable quarterly on the floating rate senior notes, annually on the euro-denominated fixed rate senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the fixed rate senior notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. Except for the euro-denominated floating rate senior notes, which may not be redeemed early, the floating rate senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part on or after their applicable call dates at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which 13 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. The company was in compliance with all covenants at April 2, 2022. In February 2022, the company redeemed all of its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025. In connection with the redemption, the company incurred $ 26 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt. Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V. (Thermo Fisher International), a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued each of the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00% Senior Notes due 2023, the 0.00% Senior Notes due 2025, the 0.80% Senior Notes due 2030, the 1.125% Senior Notes due 2033, the 1.625% Senior Notes due 2041, and the 2.00% Senior Notes due 2051 included in the table above (collectively, the “Euronotes”) in registered public offerings. The company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of Thermo Fisher International’s obligations under the Euronotes and all of Thermo Fisher International’s other debt securities, and no other subsidiary of the company will guarantee these obligations. Thermo Fisher International is a “finance subsidiary” as defined in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of the Exchange Act, with no assets or operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Euronotes and other debt securities issued by Thermo Fisher International from time to time. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Thermo Fisher International are consolidated in the financial statements of the company. Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. At April 2, 2022, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending environmental-related matters disclosed in the company’s 2021 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies The company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The disputes and litigation matters include product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed in the company’s 2021 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters The company is involved in various proceedings and litigation that arise from time to time in connection with product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters. At April 2, 2022, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending product liability, workers compensation, and other personal injury matters disclosed in the company’s 2021 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated insurance recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the 14 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. Note 9.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company initially measures the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on amounts expected to be transferred (probability-weighted) discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. In the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 the company recorded $ 139 million and $ 1 million, respectively, of net losses on investments which are included in other income/(expense) in the accompanying statement of income. The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs (such as likelihood of achieving production or revenue milestones, as well as changes in the fair values of the investments underlying a recapitalization investment portfolio), of the contingent consideration.

The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2021 included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the company’s risk management objectives and strategies. 17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Note 12. Restructuring and Other Costs In the first three months of 2022, restructuring and other costs primarily included continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations. In 2022, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected less than 0.1 % of the company’s workforce. As of May 6, 2022, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $ 15 million, primarily in 2022, and expects to identify additional actions in future periods which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred. 18 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), are made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding: projections of revenues, expenses, earnings, margins, tax rates, tax provisions, cash flows, pension and benefit obligations and funding requirements, and our liquidity position; cost reductions, restructuring activities, new product and service developments, competitive strengths or market position, acquisitions or divestitures; growth, declines and other trends in markets we sell into; new or modified laws, regulations and accounting pronouncements; outstanding claims, legal proceedings, tax audits and assessments and other contingent liabilities; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; general economic and capital markets conditions; the timing of any of the foregoing; assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s business; and any other statements that address events or developments that Thermo Fisher intends or believes will or may occur in the future. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements are accompanied by such words. While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the company’s estimates change, and readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing the company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this report. A number of important factors could cause the results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the caption “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (which is on file with the SEC). Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties relating to: the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; the need to develop new products and adapt to significant technological change; implementation of strategies for improving growth; general economic conditions and related uncertainties; dependence on customers’ capital spending policies and government funding policies; the effect of economic and political conditions and exchange rate fluctuations on international operations; use and protection of intellectual property; the effect of changes in governmental regulations; any natural disaster, public health crisis or other catastrophic event; and the effect of laws and regulations governing government contracts, as well as the possibility that expected benefits related to recent or pending acquisitions may not materialize as expected. The company refers to various amounts or measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to their most directly comparable amount or measure under the section “ Non-GAAP Measures ” later in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” Overview Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies, and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. The company’s operations fall into four segments (Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview (continued) Organic Revenue Growth Three months ended April 2, 2022 Revenue growth 19 % Impact of acquisitions 18 % Impact of currency translation (2) % Organic revenue growth* (non-GAAP measure) 3 % * Results may not sum due to rounding Since 2020, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business have supported COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The biosciences and bioproduction businesses have expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they have expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, our pharma services business has provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2022, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Sales of products related to COVID-19 testing were $1.68 billion and $2.45 billion in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the first quarter of 2022 demand from biotech and pharma customers was very strong, driven by our unique value proposition and trusted partner status. We saw growth in the academic and government market due to a positive funding environment. The industrial and applied market was particularly strong, led by robust demand from semiconductor and materials sciences customers. The diagnostics and healthcare market declined due to decreased demand for COVID-19 testing products. During the first quarter of 2022, sales growth was strong in the Asia Pacific region, particularly China, modest in North America, and flat in Europe. The company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars: • A commitment to high-impact innovation, • Scale in high-growth and emerging markets, and • A unique value proposition to our customers. GAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin decreased in the first quarter of 2022 due primarily to the expected impact of incorporating recent acquisitions, lower COVID-19 testing volumes, and strategic growth investments. This was partially offset by strong pricing realization and productivity improvements to address inflation. GAAP operating income margin was also impacted by higher amortization expense as a result of 2021 acquisitions. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Notable Recent Acquisitions On January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, the Belgium-based European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS for $830 million in net cash consideration. The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers. The acquisition expands the segment’s capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies. On February 25, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Mesa Biotech, Inc., a U.S.-based molecular diagnostic company, for $407 million in net cash consideration and contingent consideration with an initial fair value of $65 million due upon the completion of certain milestones. Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a PCR based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19. The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care. 21 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview (continued) On September 30, 2021, the company assumed operating responsibility, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, of a new state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland from CSL Limited to perform pharma services for CSL with capacity to serve other customers as well. The company expects to make fixed lease payments aggregating to $555 million (excluding renewals) from 2021 to 2041, with additional amounts dependent on the extent of revenues from customers of the facility other than CSL. On December 8, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, PPD, Inc., a U.S.-based global provider of clinical research services to the pharma and biotech industry, for $15.99 billion in net cash consideration and $43 million of equity awards exchanged. The addition of PPD’s clinical research services enhances our offering to biotech and pharma customers by enabling them to accelerate innovation and increase their productivity within the drug development process. In 2020, PPD generated revenues of $4.68 billion. On December 30, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, PeproTech, Inc., a U.S. based developer and manufacturer of recombinant proteins, for $1.86 billion in net cash consideration. PeproTech provides bioscience reagents known as recombinant proteins, including cytokines and growth factors. The acquisition expands the segment’s bioscience offerings. Results of Operations The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits as defined in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2021. Accordingly, the following segment data are reported on this basis. Three months ended April 2, April 3, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $ 4,231 $ 4,203 Analytical Instruments 1,518 1,387 Specialty Diagnostics 1,482 1,615 Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services 5,442 3,597 Eliminations (855) (896) Consolidated revenues $ 11,818 $ 9,906 Life Sciences Solutions Three months ended Organic* (non-GAAP measure) (Dollars in millions) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Total Change Currency Translation Acquisitions/ Divestitures Revenues $ 4,231 $ 4,203 1 % (2) % 3 % (1) % Segment income 2,176 2,279 (5) % Segment income margin 51.4 % 54.2 % -2.8 pt * Results may not sum due to rounding The decrease in organic revenues in the first quarter of 2022 was primarily due to lower revenue in the genetic sciences business, driven by lower demand for testing to diagnose COVID-19, largely offset by strong growth in bioproduction and biosciences products. The decrease in segment income margin resulted primarily from sales mix and strategic growth investments, offset in part by productivity improvements. Analytical Instruments Three months ended Organic* (non-GAAP measure) (Dollars in millions) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Total Change Currency Translation Acquisitions/ Divestitures Revenues $ 1,518 $ 1,387 9 % (2) % — % 12 % Segment income 301 272 10 % Segment income margin 19.8 % 19.6 % 0.2 pt * Results may not sum due to rounding 22 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) The increase in organic revenues in the first quarter of 2022 was due to increased demand across all of the segment’s primary businesses, with particular strength in electron microscopy instruments and, to a lesser extent, chromatography and mass spectrometry. The increase in segment income margin resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset by strategic growth investments. Specialty Diagnostics Three months ended Organic* (non-GAAP measure) (Dollars in millions) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Total Change Currency Translation Acquisitions/ Divestitures Revenues $ 1,482 $ 1,615 (8) % (1) % — % (7) % Segment income 353 428 (17) % Segment income margin 23.9 % 26.5 % -2.6 pt * Results may not sum due to rounding The decrease in organic revenues in the first quarter of 2022 was due to decreased demand, primarily driven by products addressing treatment of COVID-19, partially offset by growth in the healthcare markets channel, transplant diagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses. The decrease in segment income margin was primarily due to sales mix and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments, partially offset by productivity improvements. Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services Three months ended Organic* (non-GAAP measure) (Dollars in millions) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Total Change Currency Translation Acquisitions/ Divestitures Revenues $ 5,442 $ 3,597 51 % (2) % 47 % 6 % Segment income 620 531 17 % Segment income margin 11.4 % 14.8 % -3.4 pt * Results may not sum due to rounding The increase in organic revenues in the first quarter of 2022 was primarily due to higher sales in the research and safety market channel and, to a lesser extent, laboratory product business. The acquisition of PPD, the company’s clinical research business, contributed $1.66 billion of revenue during the first quarter. The decrease in segment income margin was primarily due to strategic growth investments and sales mix, partially offset by profit on higher sales. Non-operating Items Three months ended April 2, April 3, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Net interest expense $ 118 $ 113 GAAP other income/(expense) (163) (183) Adjusted other income/(expense) (non-GAAP measure) 4 14 GAAP tax rate 11.9 % 15.1 % Adjusted tax rate (non-GAAP measure) 14.1 % 16.0 % Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) increased due primarily to the increase in debt to finance the acquisition of PPD and for general corporate purposes, offset in part by lower average interest rates. See additional discussion under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. GAAP other income/(expense) and adjusted other income/(expense) includes currency transaction gains, losses on non-operating monetary assets and liabilities, and net periodic pension benefit cost/income, excluding the service cost component. GAAP other income/(expense) in 2022 also includes $141 million of net losses on investments and $26 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 7). GAAP other income/(expense) in 2021 also includes $197 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt. The company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the benefits of our tax planning initiatives, including the release of the valuation allowance in a jurisdiction where the deferred tax assets are now expected to be realized. The company’s GAAP tax rate was also impacted by changes in tax rates and higher amortization expense as a result of 2021 acquisitions. 23 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) The effective tax rates in both 2022 and 2021 were also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total approximately $1.35 billion in 2022. The company expects its GAAP effective tax rate in 2022 will be between 10% and 12% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. The company expects its adjusted tax rate will be between 13% and 13.5% in 2022. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 70 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources The company’s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets. The company deploys its capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends. April 2, December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,752 $ 4,477 Total debt 33,255 34,870 Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions, capacity expansion, and repayment of third-party foreign debt by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. As of April 2, 2022, the company’s short-term debt totaled $1.87 billion. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 7). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of April 2, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $4 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. 24 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Three months ended April 2, April 3, (In millions) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,202 $ 1,978 Net cash used in investing activities (670) (1,998) Net cash used in financing activities (3,145) (4,850) Free cash flow (non-GAAP measure) 1,564 1,355 Operating Activities During the first three months of 2022, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. An increase in inventories used cash of $499 million, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $358 million primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation. Cash payments for income taxes were $303 million during the first three months of 2022. During the first three months of 2021, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. A decrease in accounts receivable provided $149 million of cash. An increase in inventories used cash of $352 million, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $1.20 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation. Cash payments for income taxes were $542 million during the first three months of 2021. Investing Activities During the first three months of 2022, acquisitions used cash of $40 million. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $640 million of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. During the first three months of 2021, acquisitions used cash of $1.34 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $628 million of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. Financing Activities During the first three months of 2022, repayment of senior notes and net commercial paper activity used cash of $375 million and $633 million, respectively. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock (3.3 million shares) and the payment of $103 million in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock. At May 6, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. During the first three months of 2021 repayment of senior notes used cash of $2.80 billion. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $87 million in cash dividends. The company’s commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially between December 31, 2021 and April 2, 2022. The company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion. Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company’s short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods. We report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company’s core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable: 25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Non-GAAP Measures (continued) • Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs. • Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs. • Equity in earnings/losses of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. • The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. • The tax impacts of the above items and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as changes in deferred taxes from enacted tax rate changes), the latter of which we exclude because they are outside of our normal operations and difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We report free cash flow, which is operating cash flow excluding net capital expenditures, to provide a view of the continuing operations’ ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. The company also uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. The non-GAAP financial measures of Thermo Fisher Scientific’s results of operations and cash flows included in this Form 10-Q are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for Thermo Fisher Scientific’s results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth within the “Overview” and “Results of Operations” sections and below.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2021 describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes in the company’s critical accounting policies during the first three months of 2022. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “ Recent Accounting Pronouncements ” in Note 1. 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company’s exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates has not changed materially from its exposure discussed in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended April 2, 2022, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting. 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities A summary of the share repurchase activity for the company’s first quarter of 2022 follows: Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs (1) Maximum dollar amount of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs (1) (in millions) Fiscal January (Jan. 1 - Feb. 5) 3,278,186 $ 610.09 3,278,186 $ 1,000 Fiscal February (Feb. 6 - Mar. 5) — $ — — 1,000 Fiscal March (Mar. 6 - Apr. 2) — $ — — 1,000 Total first quarter 3,278,186 $ 610.09 3,278,186 $ 1,000 (1) On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock. All of the shares of common stock repurchased by the company during the first quarter of 2022 were purchased under this program. Item 5. Other Information Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act In March 2021, the Russian Federal Security Service (the FSB) was designated as a blocked party under Executive Order 13382. During the quarter ended April 2, 2022, one of our Russian affiliates responded to an official inquiry from FSB regarding the manufacture of a certain instrument registered as a medical device in Russia. This interaction did not result in any revenue or otherwise contribute to our net income for the quarter and all such dealings were legal and authorized by General License 1B issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics and therapies, and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Interim Financial Statements The interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared by the company, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position at October 2, 2021, the results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020, and the cash flows for the nine-month periods ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2020, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain all information that is included in the annual financial statements and notes thereto of the company. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the 2020 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2020 describes the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes in the company’s significant accounting policies during the nine months ended October 2, 2021. Inventories The components of inventories are as follows: October 2, December 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Raw Materials $ 1,840 $ 1,305 Work in Process 680 540 Finished Goods 2,386 2,184 Inventories $ 4,906 $ 4,029 Prior to the third quarter of 2021, certain of the company’s businesses utilized the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories. During the third quarter of 2021, these businesses, which comprise approximately 5 % of consolidated inventories, changed from the LIFO method to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The company believes this change is preferable as it will provide a consistent, uniform costing method for all inventories across the company, better reflect the current value of inventories, and improve comparability with peers. Prior financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted due to immateriality. The cumulative pre-tax effect of this change in accounting principle of $ 33 million was recorded as an increase to inventories and a decrease to cost of product revenues in the third quarter of 2021. This change was recorded in the Laboratory Products and Services ($ 20 million) and Specialty Diagnostics ($ 13 million) segments. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company’s estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic materially adversely affected certain of the company’s businesses in 2020, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the other three 8 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) segments. The negative impacts have significantly lessened so far in 2021. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which may include inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, are uncertain and may require changes to estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October 2021, the FASB amended guidance to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. Generally, this new guidance will result in the company recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at the same amounts recorded by the acquiree. The company will adopt this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2021 retrospectively to all business combinations completed in the first three quarters of 2021 and prospectively to all future business combinations. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements for prior acquisitions; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in future business combinations. In July 2021, the FASB amended guidance to require lessors to classify leases as operating leases if they have certain variable lease payment structures and would have selling losses if they were classified as sales-type or direct financing leases. The company adopted the guidance in the third quarter of 2021 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. Among other things, the new guidance requires the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates to be reflected in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The company adopted this guidance in 2021 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future events or conditions that would be affected such as enacted changes in tax laws or rates. Note 2. Acquisitions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses and the benefits that will be gained from the assembled workforce. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Pending Acquisition On April 15, 2021, the company entered into a definitive agreement under which it will acquire PPD, Inc. for $ 47.50 per share for a total cash purchase price of $ 17.4 billion plus the assumption of approximately $ 3.5 billion of net debt. PPD provides a broad range of clinical research and specialized laboratory services to enable customers to accelerate innovation and increase drug development productivity. Upon close of the transaction, PPD will become part of the Laboratory Products and Services Segment. Shareholders holding in aggregate approximately 60 % of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of PPD on April 15, 2021, have approved the transaction by written consent. No further action by other PPD shareholders is required to approve the transaction. On July 16, 2021, the company and PPD each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (collectively, the “Second Request”) from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), in connection with the FTC’s review of the proposed merger. The effect of the Second Request is to extend the waiting period imposed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), until the 30th day after substantial compliance by the company and PPD with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the FTC. As of October 22, 2021, both the company and PPD had certified substantial compliance with the Second Request. The transaction remains subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including termination of the HSR Act waiting period and receipt of applicable regulatory approvals outside the U.S. Subject to the satisfaction of the required closing conditions, we continue to expect the merger to be completed by the end of 2021. 9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) 2021 On January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, the Belgium-based European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS for $ 834 million in net cash consideration. The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers. The acquisition expands the segment’s capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not tax deductible. On February 25, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Mesa Biotech, Inc., a U.S.-based molecular diagnostic company, for $ 409 million in net cash consideration and contingent consideration with an initial fair value of $ 65 million due upon the completion of certain milestones. Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19. The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not tax deductible. On September 30, 2021, the company assumed operating responsibility, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, of a new state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland from CSL Limited to perform pharma services for CSL with capacity to serve other customers as well. The company expects to make fixed lease payments aggregating to $ 555 million (excluding renewals) from 2021 to 2041, with additional amounts dependent on the extent of revenues from customers of the facility other than CSL. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not tax deductible.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) senior notes issued in October 2021. The company is currently evaluating a future debt offering and the timing of such transaction is subject to market and other conditions. Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility (the Facility) with a bank group that provides for up to $ 3.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The Facility expires on December 4, 2025. The revolving credit agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate (or LIBOR successor rate), a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of October 2, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $ 4 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of October 2, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under these programs. Senior Notes Interest is payable annually on the euro-denominated senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. The company was in compliance with all covenants at October 2, 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, the company redeemed some of its existing senior notes. In connection with these redemptions, the company incurred $ 197 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in Other Income (Expense) on the accompanying statement of income. Upon redemption of the senior notes, the company terminated the related fixed to floating rate interest rate swap arrangements and received $ 22 million, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows.

Thermo Fisher International is a “finance subsidiary” as defined in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of the Exchange Act, with no assets or operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Euronotes and other debt securities issued by Thermo Fisher International from time to time. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Thermo Fisher International are consolidated in the financial statements of the company. Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. At October 2, 2021, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending environmental-related matters disclosed in the company’s 2020 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies The company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The disputes and litigation matters include product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed in the company's 2020 financial statements and notes included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters The company is involved in various proceedings and litigation that arise from time to time in connection with product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters. At October 2, 2021, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending product liability, workers compensation, and other personal injury matters disclosed in the company’s 2020 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated insurance recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. 16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Loss on Supply Agreement In the third quarter of 2020, the Analytical Instruments segment recorded a charge to cost of product revenues for $ 108 million related to an existing supply contract for components of electron microscopy instruments. The agreement requires the company to make future minimum purchases through 2025. The company developed and launched an alternative product beginning in 2020 and based on the expected demand for the internally developed product vs. the third-party product, the company does not expect to use all of the product it will be required to buy, resulting in a loss on the purchase commitment.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company initially measures the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on amounts expected to be transferred (probability-weighted) discounted to present value.

Note 12. Restructuring and Other Costs In the first nine months of 2021 the company recorded restructuring and other costs primarily associated with charges for impairment of acquired technology and third-party transaction/integration costs related to recent acquisitions, partially offset by credits for changes in estimates of contingent acquisition consideration. In the first nine months of 2021, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected less than 1 % of the company’s workforce. As of November 4, 2021, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $ 25 million, primarily in 2021 and 2022, and expects to identify additional actions in future periods which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred.

Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s operations fall into four segments (Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. The company mobilized in early 2020 to support the COVID-19 pandemic response with products and services that help analyze, diagnose and protect from the virus. However, the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the 2020 results of the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the company’s other three segments. The negative impact has significantly lessened so far in 2021, but could worsen later in the year dependent on the success of global efforts to control and unwind from the pandemic and economic activity ramping up. Several of the company’s businesses have had a significant increase in revenues due to sales of products and services addressing diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, including test kits and, to a lesser extent, products and services for therapy and vaccine development and manufacturing. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2021, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Sales in the third quarter of 2021 were $9.33 billion, an increase of $0.81 billion from the third quarter of 2020. Excluding the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $0.59 billion (7%). In the third quarter of 2021, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.28 billion and 24.4%, respectively, compared with $2.43 billion and 28.5%, respectively, in 2020. 23 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview (continued) Net income decreased slightly to $1.90 billion in the third quarter of 2021 from $1.93 billion in the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to a decrease in operating income, offset in part by an increase in the income tax provision. During the first nine months of 2021, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $6.86 billion compared with $4.95 billion for 2020. On January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, the Belgium-based European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS for $834 million in net cash consideration. The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers. The acquisition expands the segment’s capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies. On February 25, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Mesa Biotech, Inc., a U.S.-based molecular diagnostic company, for $409 million in net cash consideration and contingent consideration with an initial fair value of $65 million due upon the completion of certain milestones. Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a PCR based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19. The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care. On September 30, 2021, the company assumed operating responsibility, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, of a new state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland from CSL Limited to perform pharma services for CSL with capacity to serve other customers as well. The company expects to make fixed lease payments aggregating to $555 million (excluding renewals) from 2021 to 2041, with additional amounts dependent on the extent of revenues from customers of the facility other than CSL. On April 15, 2021, the company entered into a definitive agreement under which it will acquire PPD, Inc. for $47.50 per share for a total cash purchase price of $17.4 billion plus the assumption of approximately $3.5 billion of net debt. PPD provides a broad range of clinical research and specialized laboratory services to enable customers to accelerate innovation and increase drug development productivity. In 2020, PPD generated revenue of $4.7 billion. Upon close of the transaction, PPD will become part of the Laboratory Products and Services Segment. Shareholders holding in aggregate approximately 60% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of PPD on April 15, 2021, have approved the transaction by written consent. No further action by other PPD shareholders is required to approve the transaction. On July 16, 2021, the company and PPD each received a request for additional information and documentary materials from the FTC, in connection with the FTC’s review of the proposed merger. The effect of the Second Request is to extend the waiting period imposed under the HSR Act until the 30th day after substantial compliance by the company and PPD with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the FTC. As of October 22, 2021, both the company and PPD had certified substantial compliance with the Second Request. The transaction remains subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including termination of the HSR Act waiting period and receipt of applicable regulatory approvals outside the U.S. Subject to the satisfaction of the required closing conditions, we continue to expect the merger to be completed by the end of 2021. The company intends to finance the purchase price with cash on hand and the net proceeds from issuances of debt, including the senior notes issued in October 2021. The company is currently evaluating a future debt offering and the timing of such transaction is subject to market and other conditions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2020, describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes in the company's critical accounting policies during the first nine months of 2021. 24 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $588 million (7%) driven by higher demand. Sales of products that address COVID-19 testing and treatment increased $0.08 billion to $2.05 billion in the third quarter of 2021. Conditions were strong in each of the company’s end markets during the third quarter of 2021. Sales were particularly strong in pharma and biotech driven by strong market dynamics, the company’s role in supporting customers across a wide range of therapeutic areas, and demand from biopharma customers as they continue to invest in their research and development pipelines. Sales to customers in industrial and applied markets benefited from increased customer activity. Customers in the academic and government market increased demand as a result of positive funding trends. Sales to customers in diagnostics and healthcare markets were strong as customer demand for non-COVID-19 response products and services has nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels; however, this strength was more than offset by lower COVID-19 testing year-over-year. Sales growth was strong in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region and flat in North America during the third quarter of 2021. In the third quarter of 2021, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.28 billion and 24.4%, respectively, compared with $2.43 billion and 28.5%, respectively, in 2020. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to sales mix and strategic growth investments in 2021 to support the company’s near and long-term growth, which were offset in part by profit on higher sales and productivity improvements. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Productivity improvements are calculated net of inflationary cost increases. In the third quarter of 2021, the company recorded restructuring and other costs of $77 million. In the third quarter of 2020, the company recorded restructuring and other costs of $37 million. See Note 12 for restructuring charges expected in future periods. Segment Results Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2020, describes the company’s measurement of segment income. There have been no significant changes in measurement methods used to determine segment income. The company’s references to individual businesses contributing to fluctuations in segment revenues refer to those fluctuations that drove notable changes in amount and/or percentage and are identified in decreasing order of magnitude. 25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $148 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $90 million due to acquisitions. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $59 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was primarily driven by demand for biosciences and bioproduction products. The decrease in operating income margin for the segment resulted primarily from strategic growth investments and sales mix, offset in part by profit on higher sales. 26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $126 million (9%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $14 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was due to increased demand for materials and structural analysis instruments and, to a lesser extent, chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments. The increase in operating income margin for the segment was primarily due to a $108 million charge in 2020 related to a long-term supply contract (discussed in Note 8), profit on higher sales and productivity improvements, offset in part by strategic growth investments. Specialty Diagnostics Three Months Ended October 2, September 26, (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Change Revenues $ 1,362 $ 1,430 (5) % Operating Income Margin 22.7 % 27.9 % -5.2 pt Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment decreased $68 million in the third quarter of 2021. Sales decreased $75 million (-5%) due to lower revenues at existing businesses. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $7 million. The decrease in revenues at existing businesses was due to decreased demand for COVID-19 testing products, offset in part by increased demand for clinical diagnostics and immunodiagnostics products and transplant diagnostics products. The decrease in operating income margin for the segment was primarily due to strategic growth investments, sales mix and the decrease in sales, offset in part by a $13 million credit to cost of product revenue as a result of changing the method of accounting for inventories (discussed in Note 1). Laboratory Products and Services Three Months Ended October 2, September 26, (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Change Revenues $ 3,487 $ 3,112 12 % Operating Income Margin 11.0 % 11.4 % -0.4 pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $375 million in the third quarter of 2021. Sales increased $320 million (10%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $26 million due to an acquisition. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $29 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment’s principal businesses: the research and safety market channel, the pharma services business and the lab products business. The decrease in operating income margin for the segment was primarily due to strategic growth investments, substantially offset by profit on higher sales and a $20 million credit to cost of product revenue as a result of changing the method of accounting for inventories (discussed in Note 1). Other Income/Expense The company reported other income of $14 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to other expense of $39 million in the third quarter of 2020. In 2021, other income includes $25 million of gains on investments, offset in part by $20 million for amortization of bridge loan commitment fees related to the pending acquisition of PPD. In 2020, other expense includes 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) $37 million of costs for a terminated acquisition, primarily for amortization of bridge loan commitment fees and entering into currency hedging contracts. Provision for Income Taxes The company's effective tax rate was 12.5% for the third quarter of 2021. During the quarter, the company recorded a $96 million income tax benefit related to a capital loss resulting from certain intra-entity transactions. The company expects its effective tax rate for all of 2021 will be between 11% and 13% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total approximately $1.9 billion in 2021. In the third quarter of 2020, the company’s effective tax rate was 14.2%. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.

Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $5.81 billion (27%) primarily due to increased demand. The first quarter of 2021 had three extra selling days compared to the first quarter of 2020. The company's fourth quarter of 2021 will have four fewer selling days than the corresponding 2020 quarter. Sales of products that address COVID-19 testing and treatment increased $3.34 billion to $6.78 billion in the first nine months of 2021. Sales to customers in each of the company’s primary end markets grew. Sales growth was strong in each of the company’s primary geographic areas. In the first nine months of 2021, total company operating income and operating income margin were $7.49 billion and 26.3%, respectively, compared with $4.72 billion and 21.8%, respectively, in the first nine months of 2020. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments. In the first nine months of 2021, the company recorded restructuring and other costs of $192 million (Note 12). In the first nine months of 2020, the company recorded restructuring and other costs of $65 million. 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Life Sciences Solutions Nine Months Ended October 2, September 26, (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Change Revenues $ 11,481 $ 7,800 47 % Operating Income Margin 50.7 % 48.6 % 2.1 pt Sales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $3.68 billion in the first nine months of 2021. Sales increased $3.20 billion (41%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $185 million due to acquisitions. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $300 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was driven by a combination of increased demand for testing to diagnose COVID-19 with higher sales of biosciences products and genetic sciences products and strong demand in each of the segment’s businesses. The increase in operating income margin for the segment resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments. 29 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Analytical Instruments Nine Months Ended October 2, September 26, (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Change Revenues $ 4,344 $ 3,488 25 % Operating Income Margin 18.8 % 13.7 % 5.1 pt Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $856 million in the first nine months of 2021. Sales increased $746 million (21%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $110 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was due to increased demand for products sold by each of the segment’s primary businesses with particular strength in chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments as well as materials and structural analysis instruments. The increase in operating income margin for the segment was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, a $108 million charge in 2020 related to a long-term supply contract (discussed in Note 8) and productivity improvements in 2021, offset in part by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, sales mix.

Sales increased $760 million (23%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $76 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was due to higher demand primarily driven by products addressing treatment of COVID-19, with particular strength in sales of products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel, and to a lesser extent, clinical diagnostics and immunodiagnostics products. The decrease in operating income margin for the segment was primarily due to inflationary cost increases, net of productivity improvements, sales mix and strategic investments, offset in part by profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, a $13 million credit to cost of product revenue as a result of changing the method of accounting for inventories (discussed in Note 1). Laboratory Products and Services Nine Months Ended October 2, September 26, (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Change Revenues $ 10,667 $ 8,629 24 % Operating Income Margin 12.8 % 10.8 % 2.0 pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $2.04 billion to $10.67 billion in 2021. Sales increased $1.65 billion (19%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $156 million due to an acquisition. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $228 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment’s principal businesses with particular strength in products sold through its research and safety market channel and, to a lesser extent, its laboratory products business and pharma services business. The increase in operating income margin for the segment was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions, sales mix and a $20 million credit to cost of product revenue as a result of changing the method of accounting for inventories (discussed in Note 1), offset in part by strategic growth investments. 30 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Other Expense The company reported other expense of $174 million and $36 million in the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021, other expense includes $197 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt and $26 million for amortization of bridge loan commitment fees related to the pending acquisition of PPD, offset in part by $23 million of gains on investments. In 2020, other expense includes $81 million of costs related to a terminated acquisition, primarily for entering into currency hedging contracts and amortization of loan commitment fees. Provision for Income Taxes The company recorded a $906 million provision for income taxes in the first nine months of 2021. During the second and third quarters of 2021, the company recorded income tax benefits on intra-entity transactions totaling $258 million. The company recorded a $456 million provision for income taxes in the first nine months of 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “ Recent Accounting Pronouncements ” in Note 1. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $16.97 billion at October 2, 2021, compared with $11.65 billion at December 31, 2020. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $12.03 billion at October 2, 2021 and $10.33 billion at December 31, 2020. First Nine Months of 2021 Cash provided by operating activities during the first nine months of 2021 was $6.86 billion. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. A decrease in accounts receivable provided $111 million of cash. An increase in inventories used cash of $916 million, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $582 million primarily due to the timing of payments for interest and compensation. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $1.56 billion during the first nine months of 2021, compared with $656 million in the first nine months of 2020. During the first nine months of 2021, the company’s investing activities used $3.24 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $1.52 billion. The company's investing activities also included the purchase of $1.69 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. The company’s financing activities used $1.89 billion of cash during the first nine months of 2021. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $2.81 billion. Issuance of debt provided $3.12 billion of cash. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock and the payment of $292 million in cash dividends. On November 5, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. On September 23, 2021 the Board of Directors replaced the existing authorization to repurchase the company’s common stock, of which $500 million was remaining, with a new authorization to repurchase up to $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock. At November 4, 2021, authorization remained for $3.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. As discussed in Note 7, early in October 2021, the company issued senior notes for net proceeds of $11.83 billion. The company's commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially between December 31, 2020 and October 2, 2021 except for the agreement to acquire PPD, discussed in Note 2. The company expects that for all of 2021, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion. As of October 2, 2021, the company’s short-term debt totaled $19 million. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $3.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 7). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of October 2, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding 31 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $4 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months and to fund the pending PPD acquisition. First Nine Months of 2020 Cash provided by operating activities was $4.95 billion during the first nine months of 2020. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $858 million and $427 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities provided cash of $1.04 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $656 million. During the first nine months of 2020, the company’s investing activities used $884 million of cash, principally for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities provided $1.01 billion of cash during the first nine months of 2020. Issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $712 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company’s common stock and the payment of $250 million in cash dividends. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company's exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates has not changed materially from its exposure discussed in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended October 2, 2021, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting. 32 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings There are various lawsuits and claims against the company involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. See “Note 8 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – Commitments and Contingencies .” Item 1A. Risk Factors The risks that we believe are material to our investors are discussed in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 under the caption “Risk Factors,” which is on file with the SEC. Except as set forth herein, there have been no material changes during the nine months ended October 2, 2021 to our previously reported Risk Factors. Risks Relating to Our Proposed Acquisition of PPD Regulatory approvals necessary for our acquisition of PPD may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the PPD acquisition. Before the PPD acquisition may be completed, we must obtain certain required regulatory approvals, waivers or consents. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the transaction. Such conditions could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the transaction, causing us to incur additional costs or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the transaction, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the transaction. Additionally, any delay in closing may adversely affect the business of PPD and therefore the combined company following the transaction, including an adverse effect on PPD’s ability to retain employees during the pendency of the transaction or on PPD’s relationships with its vendors, customers and other parties if such vendors, customers or other parties attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships, consider entering into business relationships with parties other than PPD or delay or defer decisions concerning their business with PPD during the pendency of the transaction. On July 16, 2021, we and PPD each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (collectively, the “Second Request”) from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), in connection with the FTC’s review of the proposed merger. The effect of the Second Request is to extend the waiting period imposed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), until the 30th day after substantial compliance by us and PPD with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the FTC. As of October 22, 2021, both we and PPD had certified substantial compliance with the Second Request. The transaction remains subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including termination of the HSR Act waiting period and receipt of applicable regulatory approvals outside the U.S. Subject to the satisfaction of the required closing conditions, we continue to expect the merger to be completed by the end of 2021. Combining PPD with us may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction may not be fully realized . The success of the PPD acquisition, including the realization of anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine our and PPD’s businesses. The integration may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or that the alignment of standards, controls, procedures and policies may adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, suppliers and employees or to fully achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction. The loss of key employees could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business in the markets in which PPD now operates, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. Other potential difficulties of combining our and PPD’s businesses include unanticipated issues in integrating logistics, information communications and other systems. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the PPD acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of us and PPD during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the PPD acquisition on the combined company. Risks Relating to Financial Profile We have outstanding debt, and our debt will increase as a result of additional debt we expect to incur to finance the PPD acquisition. Our existing and future indebtedness may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities and negatively impact our credit ratings. As of October 2, 2021, we had approximately $21.71 billion in outstanding indebtedness and we issued approximately $11.83 billion of new debt during October. In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $3.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. We expect to incur additional indebtedness to fund a portion of the purchase price of the PPD acquisition. We may also obtain 33 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5:1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as the impact of public health epidemics/pandemics like COVID-19, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities There was no share repurchase activity for the company's third quarter of 2021. On November 5, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. On September 23, 2021 the Board of Directors replaced the existing authorization to repurchase the company’s common stock, of which $500 million was remaining, with a new authorization to repurchase up to $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock. At October 2, 2021, $3.00 billion was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under this authorization. 34 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 6.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics and therapies, and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Interim Financial Statements The interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared by the company, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position at July 3, 2021, the results of operations for the three- and six-month periods ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020, and the cash flows for the six-month periods ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2020, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain all information that is included in the annual financial statements and notes thereto of the company. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the 2020 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2020 describes the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes in the company’s significant accounting policies during the six months ended July 3, 2021. Inventories The components of inventories are as follows: July 3, December 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Raw Materials $ 1,622 $ 1,305 Work in Process 652 540 Finished Goods 2,351 2,184 Inventories $ 4,625 $ 4,029 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company’s estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic materially adversely affected certain of the company’s businesses in 2020, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the other three segments. The negative impacts have significantly lessened so far in 2021. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future are uncertain and may require changes to estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2021, the FASB amended guidance to require lessors to classify leases as operating leases if they have certain variable lease payment structures and would have selling losses if they were classified as sales-type or direct financing leases. The company expects to adopt the guidance in the third quarter of 2021 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. 8 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. Among other things, the new guidance requires the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates to be reflected in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The company adopted this guidance in 2021 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future events or conditions that would be affected such as enacted changes in tax laws or rates. Note 2. Acquisitions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Pending Acquisition On April 15, 2021, the company entered into a definitive agreement under which it will acquire PPD, Inc. for $ 47.50 per share for a total cash purchase price of $ 17.4 billion plus the assumption of approximately $ 3.5 billion of net debt. PPD provides a broad range of clinical research and specialized laboratory services to enable customers to accelerate innovation and increase drug development productivity. Upon close of the transaction, PPD will become part of the Laboratory Products and Services Segment. Shareholders holding in aggregate approximately 60 % of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of PPD on April 15, 2021, have approved the transaction by written consent. No further action by other PPD shareholders is required to approve the transaction. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. On July 16, 2021, the company and PPD each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (collectively, the “Second Request”) from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), in connection with the FTC’s review of the proposed merger. The effect of the Second Request is to extend the waiting period imposed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), until the 30th day after substantial compliance by the company and PPD with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the FTC. Subject to the satisfaction of the required closing conditions, we continue to expect the merger to be completed by the end of 2021. 2021 On January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, the Belgium-based European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS for approximately $ 834 million in net cash consideration. The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers. The acquisition expands the segment’s capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies. The goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition is not tax deductible. On February 25, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Mesa Biotech, Inc., a U.S.-based molecular diagnostic company, for approximately $ 406 million in net cash consideration and contingent consideration with an initial fair value of $ 65 million due upon the completion of certain milestones. Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19. The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care. The goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition is not tax deductible. In addition, in the first six months of 2021 the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, cell sorting technology assets, an Ireland-based life sciences distributor and a developer of a digital PCR platform. 9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) The components of the purchase prices and the allocations to the net assets acquired for 2021 acquisitions are as follows: (In millions) European Viral Vector Business Mesa Biotech Other Purchase Price Cash paid $ 853 $ 420 $ 192 Fair value of contingent consideration — 65 114 Cash acquired ( 19 ) ( 14 ) ( 7 ) $ 834 $ 471 $ 299 Net Assets Acquired Current assets $ 39 $ 54 $ 8 Property, plant and equipment 58 2 2 Definite-lived intangible assets: Customer relationships 311 — 2 Product technology 26 279 175 Tradenames — 2 3 Goodwill 593 236 134 Other assets 2 3 1 Contract liabilities ( 59 ) — ( 1 ) Deferred tax liabilities ( 82 ) ( 72 ) ( 16 ) Other liabilities assumed ( 54 ) ( 33 ) ( 9 ) $ 834 $ 471 $ 299 The weighted-average amortization periods for definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2021 are 14 years for customer relationships, 7 years for product technology and 3 years for tradenames. The weighted average amortization period for all definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2021 is 9 years. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the acquisition of the European viral vectors business was based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and is subject to adjustment upon finalization, largely with respect to acquired intangible assets and the related deferred taxes. Measurements of these items inherently require significant estimates and assumptions. 10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

See Note 10 for fair value information pertaining to the company’s long-term obligations. In connection with the agreement to acquire PPD (Note 2), the company has available, but does not currently expect to utilize, up to $ 6.5 billion of committed bridge financing. The company intends to finance the purchase price with cash on hand and the net proceeds from issuance of debt. The company is currently evaluating future debt financings and the timing of such transactions is subject to market and other conditions. The company had a cash outlay of $ 29 million in 2021 associated with obtaining the bridge commitment included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility (the Facility) with a bank group that provides for up to $ 3.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The Facility expires on December 4, 2025. The revolving credit agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate (or LIBOR successor rate), a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of July 3, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $ 4 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of July 3, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under these programs. Senior Notes Interest is payable annually on the euro-denominated senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. The company was in compliance with all covenants at July 3, 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, the company redeemed some of its existing senior notes. In connection with these redemptions, the company incurred $ 197 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in Other (Expense) Income on the accompanying statement of income. Upon redemption of the senior notes, the company terminated the related fixed to floating rate interest rate swap arrangements and received $ 22 million, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. At July 3, 2021, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending environmental-related matters disclosed in the company’s 2020 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Litigation and Related Contingencies The company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The disputes and litigation matters include product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed in the company's 2020 financial statements and notes included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters The company is involved in various proceedings and litigation that arise from time to time in connection with product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters. At July 3, 2021, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending product liability, workers compensation, and other personal injury matters disclosed in the company’s 2020 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated insurance recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. Strategic Partnership and Long-term Lease In May 2020, the company entered a strategic partnership with CSL Limited (CSL). Through a long-term lease agreement with CSL, the company will operate a new state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland, when construction is completed in the second half of 2021, to perform pharma services for CSL with capacity to serve other customers as well. The company made an initial lease payment of $ 50 million in the second quarter of 2020 (included within other assets in the accompanying balance sheet) and expects to make additional fixed lease payments aggregating to $ 555 million (excluding renewals) from 2021 to 2041, with additional amounts dependent on the extent of revenues from customers of the facility other than CSL.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company initially measures the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on amounts expected to be transferred (probability-weighted) discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs (such as likelihood of achieving production or revenue 18 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The majority of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. 20 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 12. Restructuring and Other Costs In the first six months of 2021 the company recorded restructuring and other costs primarily associated with charges for impairment of acquired technology and third-party transaction/integration costs related to recent acquisitions, partially offset by credits for changes in estimates of contingent acquisition consideration. In the first six months of 2021, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected less than 0.5 % of the company’s workforce. As of August 6, 2021, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $ 45 million, primarily in 2021, and expects to identify additional actions during 2021 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding: projections of revenues, expenses, earnings, margins, tax rates, tax provisions, cash flows, pension and benefit obligations and funding requirements, our liquidity position; cost reductions, restructuring activities, new product and service developments, competitive strengths or market position, acquisitions or divestitures; growth, declines and other trends in markets we sell into; new or modified laws, regulations and accounting pronouncements; outstanding claims, legal proceedings, tax audits and assessments and other contingent liabilities; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; general economic and capital markets conditions; the timing of any of the foregoing; assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; any potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s business; and any other statements that address events or developments that Thermo Fisher intends or believes will or may occur in the future. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements are accompanied by such words. While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the company’s estimates change, and readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing the company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are set forth under the caption “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (which is on file with the SEC) as updated under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this report on Form 10-Q. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties relating to: the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; the need to develop new products and adapt to significant technological change; implementation of strategies for improving growth; general economic conditions and related uncertainties, dependence on customers' capital spending policies and government funding policies; the effect of economic and political conditions and exchange rate fluctuations on international operations; use and protection of intellectual property; the effect of changes in governmental regulations; any natural disaster, public health crisis or other catastrophic event; and the effect of laws and regulations governing government contracts, as well as the possibility that expected benefits related to recent or pending acquisitions, including our pending acquisition of PPD, Inc., may not materialize as expected. Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s operations fall into four segments (Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. The company mobilized in early 2020 to support the COVID-19 pandemic response with products and services that help analyze, diagnose and protect from the virus. However, the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the 2020 results of the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the company’s other three segments. The negative impact has significantly lessened so far in 2021, but could worsen later in the year dependent on the success of global efforts to control the pandemic and economic activity ramping up. The company believes the impacted businesses’ long-term prospects remain excellent given the company’s attractive markets served, its industry-leading position and proven growth strategy. Several of the company’s businesses have had a significant increase in revenues due to sales of products and services addressing diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, including test kits and, to a lesser extent, products and services for therapy and vaccine development and manufacturing. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2021, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Sales in the second quarter of 2021 were $9.27 billion, an increase of $2.36 billion from the second quarter of 2020. Excluding the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $1.92 billion (28%). In the second quarter of 2021, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.16 billion and 23.3%, respectively, compared with $1.39 billion and 20.1%, respectively, in 2020. 24 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview (continued) Net income increased to $1.83 billion in the second quarter of 2021 from $1.16 billion in the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to an increase in operating income, offset in part by an increase in the income tax provision. During the first six months of 2021, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $4.21 billion compared with $2.24 billion for 2020. On January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, the Belgium-based European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS for approximately $834 million in net cash consideration. The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers. The acquisition expands the segment’s capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies. On February 25, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Mesa Biotech, Inc., a U.S.-based molecular diagnostic company, for approximately $406 million in net cash consideration and contingent consideration with an initial fair value of $65 million due upon the completion of certain milestones. Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a PCR based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19. The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care. On April 15, 2021, the company entered into a definitive agreement under which it will acquire PPD, Inc. for $47.50 per share for a total cash purchase price of $17.4 billion plus the assumption of approximately $3.5 billion of net debt. PPD provides a broad range of clinical research and specialized laboratory services to enable customers to accelerate innovation and increase drug development productivity. In 2020, PPD generated revenue of $4.7 billion. Upon close of the transaction, PPD will become part of the Laboratory Products and Services Segment. Shareholders holding in aggregate approximately 60% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of PPD on April 15, 2021, have approved the transaction by written consent. No further action by other PPD shareholders is required to approve the transaction. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. On July 16, 2021, the company and PPD each received a request for additional information and documentary materials from the FTC, in connection with the FTC’s review of the proposed merger. The effect of the Second Request is to extend the waiting period imposed under the HSR Act until the 30th day after substantial compliance by the company and PPD with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the FTC. Subject to the satisfaction of the required closing conditions, we continue to expect the merger to be completed by the end of 2021. The company intends to finance the purchase price with cash on hand and the net proceeds from issuance of debt. The company is currently evaluating future debt financings and the timing of such transactions is subject to market and other conditions. The company also has available, but it does not currently expect to utilize, up to $6.5 billion of committed bridge financing. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2020, describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes in the company's critical accounting policies during the first six months of 2021. 25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $1.92 billion (28%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales of products that address COVID-19 testing and treatment increased $0.58 billion to $1.87 billion in the second quarter of 2021. Conditions were very robust in each of the company’s end markets during the second quarter of 2021 driven by three factors: strong fundamentals in the life sciences, strong economic activity globally and the role the industry is playing in the pandemic response. Sales were particularly strong to academic and government, as well as industrial and applied customers, which were most affected in the second quarter of 2020 due to business disruptions related to the pandemic. Sales to customers in pharma and biotech markets were very strong driven by underlying market dynamics and the company’s role in supporting customers across a wide range of therapeutic areas. Sales to customers in diagnostics and healthcare markets were strong as customer demand for non-COVID-19 response products and services was approaching pre-pandemic levels. Sales growth was strong in each of the company’s primary geographic areas during the second quarter of 2021. In the second quarter of 2021, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.16 billion and 23.3%, respectively, compared with $1.39 billion and 20.1%, respectively, in 2020. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, favorable foreign currency exchange and sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments in 2021 to support the company’s near and long-term growth. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Productivity improvements are calculated net of inflationary cost increases. In the second quarter of 2021, the company recorded restructuring and other costs of $77 million. In the second quarter of 2020, the company recorded restructuring and other costs of $56 million. See Note 12 for restructuring charges expected in future periods. Segment Results Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2020, describes the company’s measurement of segment income. There have been no significant changes in measurement methods used to determine segment income. 26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $210 million (21%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $37 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was due to higher demand in each of the segment’s primary businesses with particular strength in sales of immunodiagnostics products and products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel business. The decrease in operating income margin for the segment was primarily due to inflationary cost increases, net of productivity improvements, and strategic growth investments, offset in part by profit on higher sales and sales mix. Laboratory Products and Services Three Months Ended July 3, June 27, (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Change Revenues $ 3,583 $ 2,787 29 % Operating Income Margin 12.4 % 10.1 % 2.3 pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $796 million in the second quarter of 2021. Sales increased $636 million (23%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $53 million due to an acquisition. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $107 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment’s principal businesses with particular strength in products sold through its research and safety market channel business. The increase in operating income margin for the segment was primarily due to profit on higher sales and sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments. Other Expense The company reported other expense of $5 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to other expense of $9 million in the second quarter of 2020. In 2021, other expense includes $6 million for amortization of bridge loan commitment fees related to the pending acquisition of PPD. In 2020, other expense includes $27 million of costs for a subsequently terminated acquisition, primarily for amortization of bridge loan commitment fees and entering into currency hedging contracts. 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Provision for Income Taxes The company's effective tax rate was 10.7% for the second quarter of 2021. During the quarter, the company recorded a $162 million income tax benefit on an intra-entity transfer of assets. The company expects its effective tax rate for all of 2021 will be between 11% and 13% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total approximately $1.7 billion in 2021. In the second quarter of 2020, the company’s effective tax rate was 7.8%. In 2020, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “ Recent Accounting Pronouncements ” in Note 1. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $12.34 billion at July 3, 2021, compared with $11.65 billion at December 31, 2020. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $7.02 billion at July 3, 2021 and $10.33 billion at December 31, 2020. First Six Months of 2021 Cash provided by operating activities during the first six months of 2021 was $4.21 billion. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. A decrease in accounts receivable provided $249 million of cash. An increase in inventories used cash of $621 million, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $1.06 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $1.27 billion during the first six months of 2021, compared with $320 million in the first six months of 2020. During the first six months of 2021, the company’s investing activities used $2.62 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $1.43 billion. The company's investing activities also included the purchase of $1.17 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. The company’s financing activities used $4.93 billion of cash during the first six months of 2021. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $2.81 billion. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock and the payment of $190 million in cash dividends. On November 5, 2020, the Board of Directors replaced the existing authorization to repurchase the company’s common stock with a new authorization to repurchase up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. At August 6, 2021, authorization remained for $500 million of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. The company's commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially between December 31, 2020 and July 3, 2021 except for the agreement to acquire PPD, discussed in Note 2. The company expects that for all of 2021, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion. As of July 3, 2021, the company’s short-term debt totaled $4 million. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $3.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 7). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of July 3, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $4 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. 32 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement and bridge loan agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months and to fund the pending PPD acquisition. First Six Months of 2020 Cash provided by operating activities was $2.24 billion during the first six months of 2020. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $195 million and $309 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities provided cash of $303 million primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $320 million. During the first six months of 2020, the company’s investing activities used $519 million of cash, principally for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities provided $1.80 billion of cash during the first six months of 2020. Issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company’s common stock and the payment of $163 million in cash dividends. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company's exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates has not changed materially from its exposure discussed in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended July 3, 2021, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting. 33 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings There are various lawsuits and claims against the company involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. See “Note 8 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – Commitments and Contingencies .” Item 1A. Risk Factors The risks that we believe are material to our investors are discussed in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 under the caption “Risk Factors,” which is on file with the SEC. Except as set forth herein, there have been no material changes during the six months ended July 3, 2021 to our previously reported Risk Factors. Risks Relating to Our Proposed Acquisition of PPD Regulatory approvals necessary for our acquisition of PPD may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the PPD acquisition. Before the PPD acquisition may be completed, we must obtain certain required regulatory approvals, waivers or consents. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the transaction. Such conditions could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the transaction, causing us to incur additional costs or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the transaction, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the transaction. Additionally, any delay in closing may adversely affect the business of PPD and therefore the combined company following the transaction, including an adverse effect on PPD’s ability to retain employees during the pendency of the transaction or on PPD’s relationships with its vendors, customers and other parties if such vendors, customers or other parties attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships, consider entering into business relationships with parties other than PPD or delay or defer decisions concerning their business with PPD during the pendency of the transaction. On July 16, 2021, we and PPD each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (collectively, the “Second Request”) from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), in connection with the FTC’s review of the proposed merger. The effect of the Second Request is to extend the waiting period imposed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), until the 30th day after substantial compliance by the us and PPD with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the FTC. Subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the required regulatory approvals, waivers or consents, we continue to expect the merger to be completed by the end of 2021. Combining PPD with us may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction may not be fully realized . The success of the PPD acquisition, including the realization of anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine our and PPD’s businesses. The integration may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or that the alignment of standards, controls, procedures and policies may adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, suppliers and employees or to fully achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction. The loss of key employees could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business in the markets in which PPD now operates, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. Other potential difficulties of combining our and PPD’s businesses include unanticipated issues in integrating logistics, information communications and other systems. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the PPD acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of us and PPD during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the PPD acquisition on the combined company. Risks Relating to Financial Profile We have outstanding debt, and our debt will increase as a result of additional debt we expect to incur to finance the PPD acquisition. Our existing and future indebtedness may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities and negatively impact our credit ratings. As of July 3, 2021, we had approximately $18.78 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $3.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. We expect to incur additional indebtedness to fund a portion of the purchase price of the PPD acquisition. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. 34 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5:1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as the impact of public health epidemics/pandemics like COVID-19, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities There was no share repurchase activity for the company's second quarter of 2021. On November 5, 2020, the Board of Directors replaced the existing authorization to repurchase the company’s common stock with a new authorization to repurchase up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. At July 3, 2021, $500 million was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under this authorization. 35 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 6.

(the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics and therapies, and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Interim Financial Statements The interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared by the company, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position at April 3, 2021, the results of operations for the three-month periods ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, and the cash flows for the three-month periods ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2020, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain all information that is included in the annual financial statements and notes thereto of the company. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the 2020 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2020 describes the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes in the company’s significant accounting policies during the three months ended April 3, 2021. Inventories The components of inventories are as follows: April 3, December 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Raw Materials $ 1,491 $ 1,305 Work in Process 602 540 Finished Goods 2,249 2,184 Inventories $ 4,342 $ 4,029 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company’s estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic materially adversely affected certain of the company’s businesses in 2020, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the other three segments. The extent and duration of negative impacts continuing into the remainder of 2021 are uncertain and may require changes to estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. Among other things, the new guidance requires the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates to be reflected in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The company adopted this guidance in 2021 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial 8 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) statements; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future events or conditions that would be affected such as enacted changes in tax laws or rates. Note 2. Acquisitions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Proposed Acquisition On April 15, 2021, the company entered into a definitive agreement under which it will acquire PPD, Inc. for $ 47.50 per share for a total cash purchase price of $ 17.4 billion plus the assumption of approximately $ 3.5 billion of net debt. PPD provides a broad range of clinical research and specialized laboratory services to enable customers to accelerate innovation and increase drug development productivity. Upon close of the transaction, PPD will become part of the Laboratory Products and Services Segment. The transaction, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2021, is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. Shareholders holding in aggregate approximately 60 % of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of PPD have approved the transaction by written consent. No further action by other PPD shareholders is required to approve the transaction. 2021 On January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, the Belgium-based European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS for approximately $ 834 million in net cash consideration. The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers. The acquisition expands the segment’s capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies. The goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition is not tax deductible. On February 25, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Mesa Biotech, Inc., a U.S.-based molecular diagnostic company, for approximately $ 406 million in net cash consideration and contingent consideration with an initial fair value of $ 65 million due upon the completion of certain milestones. Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19. The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care. The goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition is not tax deductible. In addition, in the first three months of 2021 the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, cell sorting technology assets and, also within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, an Ireland-based life sciences distributor. 9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) The components of the purchase prices and the preliminary allocations to the net assets acquired for 2021 acquisitions are as follows: (In millions) European Viral Vector Business Mesa Biotech Other Purchase Price Cash paid $ 853 $ 420 $ 107 Fair value of contingent consideration — 65 97 Cash acquired ( 19 ) ( 14 ) ( 4 ) $ 834 $ 471 $ 200 Net Assets Acquired Current assets $ 40 $ 54 $ 8 Property, plant and equipment 39 2 1 Definite-lived intangible assets: Customer relationships 311 — 3 Product technology 26 263 110 Tradenames — 2 2 Goodwill 593 248 83 Other assets 19 3 1 Contract liabilities ( 59 ) — ( 1 ) Deferred tax liabilities ( 82 ) ( 68 ) — Other liabilities assumed ( 53 ) ( 33 ) ( 7 ) $ 834 $ 471 $ 200 The weighted-average amortization periods for definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2021 are 14 years for customer relationships, 6 years for product technology and 3 years for tradenames. The weighted average amortization period for all definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2021 is 9 years. The preliminary allocations of the purchase price for the acquisitions of the European viral vector business and Mesa Biotech were based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization, largely with respect to acquired intangible assets and deferred taxes. Measurements of these items inherently require significant estimates and assumptions. 10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company is currently evaluating future debt financings and the timing of such transactions is subject to market and other conditions. 14 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility (the Facility) with a bank group that provides for up to $ 3.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The Facility expires on December 4, 2025. The revolving credit agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate (or LIBOR successor rate), a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of April 3, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $ 31 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of April 3, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under these programs. Senior Notes Interest is payable annually on the euro-denominated senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. The company was in compliance with all covenants at April 3, 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, the company redeemed some of its existing senior notes. In connection with these redemptions, the company incurred $ 197 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in Other (Expense) Income on the accompanying statement of income. Upon redemption of the senior notes, the company terminated the related fixed to floating rate interest rate swap arrangements and received $ 22 million, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. At April 3, 2021, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending environmental-related matters disclosed in the company’s 2020 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Litigation and Related Contingencies The company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, and litigation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The disputes and litigation matters include product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed in the company's 2020 financial statements and notes included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters The company is involved in various proceedings and litigation that arise from time to time in connection with product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters. At April 3, 2021, there have been no material changes to the accruals for pending product liability, workers compensation, and other personal injury matters disclosed in the company’s 2020 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated insurance recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. Strategic Partnership and Long-term Lease In May 2020, the company entered a strategic partnership with CSL Limited (CSL). Through a long-term lease agreement with CSL, the company will operate a new state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland, when construction is completed in the second half of 2021, to perform pharma services for CSL with capacity to serve other customers as well. The company made an initial lease payment of $ 50 million in the second quarter of 2020 (included within other assets in the accompanying balance sheet) and expects to make additional fixed lease payments aggregating to $ 555 million (excluding renewals) from 2021 to 2041, with additional amounts dependent on the extent of revenues from customers of the facility other than CSL.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company initially measures the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on amounts expected to be transferred (probability-weighted) discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. The following table provides 17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs (such as likelihood of achieving production or revenue milestones), of the contingent consideration.

Restructuring and Other Costs In the first three months of 2021 the company recorded restructuring and other costs primarily associated with charges for compensation contractually due to employees of acquired businesses at the date of acquisition, third-party transaction/integration costs related to recent acquisitions, and charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. In the first three months of 2021, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected less than 0.1 % of the company’s workforce. As of May 7, 2021, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $ 40 million, primarily in 2021, and expects to identify additional actions during 2021 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred.

Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s operations fall into four segments (Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. The company mobilized in early 2020 to support the COVID-19 pandemic response with products and services that help analyze, diagnose and protect from the virus. However, the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the 2020 results of the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the company’s other three segments. The extent and duration of the negative impacts continuing into the remainder of 2021 are uncertain and dependent in part on the success of global efforts to control the pandemic and economic activity ramping up. The company believes the impacted businesses’ long-term prospects remain excellent given the company’s attractive markets served, its industry-leading position and proven growth strategy. Several of the company’s businesses have had a significant increase in revenues due to sales of product and services addressing diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, including test kits and, to a lesser extent, products and services for therapy and vaccine development and manufacturing. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2021, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Sales in the first quarter of 2021 were $9.91 billion, an increase of $3.68 billion from the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $3.31 billion (53%). In the first quarter of 2021, total company operating income and operating income margin were $3.05 billion and 30.8%, respectively, compared with $0.91 billion and 14.5%, respectively, in 2020. 22 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview (continued) Net income increased to $2.34 billion in the first quarter of 2021 from $0.79 billion in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to an increase in operating income, offset in part by an increase in the income tax provision and $197 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt. During the first three months of 2021, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $1.98 billion compared with $0.36 billion for 2020. On January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, the Belgium-based European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS for approximately $834 million in net cash consideration. The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers. The acquisition expands the segment’s capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies. On February 25, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Mesa Biotech, Inc., a U.S.-based molecular diagnostic company, for approximately $406 million in net cash consideration and contingent consideration with an initial fair value of $65 million due upon the completion of certain milestones. Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a PCR based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19. The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care. On April 15, 2021, the company entered into a definitive agreement under which it will acquire PPD, Inc. for $47.50 per share for a total cash purchase price of $17.4 billion plus the assumption of approximately $3.5 billion of net debt. PPD provides a broad range of clinical research and specialized laboratory services to enable customers to accelerate innovation and increase drug development productivity. In 2020, PPD generated revenue of $4.7 billion.. Upon close of the transaction, PPD will become part of the Laboratory Products and Services Segment. The transaction, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2021, is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. Shareholders holding in aggregate approximately 60% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of PPD have approved the transaction by written consent. No further action by other PPD shareholders is required to approve the transaction. The company intends to finance the purchase price with cash on hand and the net proceeds from issuance of debt. The company is currently evaluating future debt financings and the timing of such transactions is subject to market and other conditions. The company also has available, but it does not currently expect to utilize, up to $9.5 billion of committed bridge financing. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2020, describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes in the company's critical accounting policies during the first three months of 2021.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the first quarter of 2021 increased $3.68 billion from the first quarter of 2020. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $3.31 billion (53%) primarily due to increased demand. The first quarter of 2021 had three extra selling days in the quarter compared to the 2020 quarter. The company's fourth quarter of 2021 will have four fewer selling days than the corresponding 2020 quarter. Sales of products that address COVID-19 testing and treatment increased $2.68 billion to $2.85 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Sales were particularly strong in diagnostic and healthcare markets, primarily due to demand for products supporting customers diagnosing the COVID-19 virus, as well as to customers in pharma and biotech markets where demand was strong for products and services and pandemic-related demand for vaccines and therapies also contributed to growth. Sales to academic and government customers and customers in industrial markets were strong primarily due to robust customer activity. Sales growth was strong in each of the company’s primary geographic areas during the first quarter of 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, total company operating income and operating income margin were $3.05 billion and 30.8%, respectively, compared with $0.91 billion and 14.5%, respectively, in 2020. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments in 2021 to support the company’s near and long-term growth. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system including reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Productivity improvements are calculated net of inflationary cost increases. In the first quarter of 2021, the company recorded restructuring and other costs of $38 million. In the first quarter of 2020, the company recorded restructuring and other costs of $46 million. See Note 12 for restructuring charges expected in future periods. Segment Results Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2020, describes the company’s measurement of segment income. There have been no significant changes in measurement methods used to determine segment income. 24 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $2.30 billion (129%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $32 million due to acquisitions. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $101 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was primarily driven by demand for testing to diagnose COVID-19 with higher sales of genetic sciences products and, to a lesser extent, biosciences products. Sales also grew due to higher demand for bioproduction products. The increase in operating income margin for the segment resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments. 25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $240 million (22%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $46 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was due to increased demand for products sold by each of the segment’s primary businesses with particular strength in chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments. The increase in operating income margin for the segment was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, offset in part by sales mix and strategic growth investments.

The increase in revenues at existing businesses was due to higher demand primarily driven by products addressing treatment of COVID-19, with particular strength in sales of products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel business, and to a lesser extent, microbiology and clinical diagnostics products. The increase in operating income margin for the segment was primarily due to profit on higher sales, offset in part by sales mix and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments.

Sales increased $699 million (26%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $76 million due to an acquisition. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $92 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment’s principal businesses. The increase in operating income margin for the segment was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, offset in part by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, sales mix. Other Income/Expense The company reported other expense of $183 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to other income of $12 million in the first quarter of 2020. In 2021, other expense includes $197 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt. Provision for Income Taxes The company's effective tax rate was 15.1% for the first quarter of 2021. The company expects its effective tax rate for all of 2021 will be between 11% and 13% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company 26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total approximately $1.5 billion in 2021. In the first quarter of 2020, the company’s effective tax rate was 4.8%. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “ Recent Accounting Pronouncements ” in Note 1. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $10.69 billion at April 3, 2021, compared with $11.65 billion at December 31, 2020. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $5.58 billion at April 3, 2021 and $10.33 billion at December 31, 2020. First Three Months of 2021 Cash provided by operating activities during the first three months of 2021 was $1.98 billion. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. A decrease in accounts receivable provided $149 million of cash. An increase in inventories used cash of $352 million, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $1.20 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $542 million during the first three months of 2021, compared with $100 million in the first three months of 2020. During the first three months of 2021, the company’s investing activities used $2.00 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $1.34 billion. The company's investing activities also included the purchase of $628 million of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. The company’s financing activities used $4.85 billion of cash during the first three months of 2021. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $2.80 billion. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock and the payment of $87 million in cash dividends. On November 5, 2020, the Board of Directors replaced the existing authorization to repurchase the company’s common stock with a new authorization to repurchase up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. At May 7, 2021, authorization remained for $500 million of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. The company's commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially between December 31, 2020 and April 3, 2021 except for the agreement to acquire PPD, discussed in Note 2. The company expects that for all of 2021, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion. As of April 3, 2021, the company’s short-term debt totaled $4 million. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $3.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 7). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of April 3, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $31 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement and bridge loan agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months and to fund the pending PPD acquisition. First Three Months of 2020 Cash provided by operating activities was $356 million during the first three months of 2020. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $218 million and $141 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $443 million primarily due to the timing of customer billings. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $100 million. During the first three months of 2020, the company’s investing activities used $260 million of cash, principally for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities provided $619 million of cash during the first three months of 2020. Issuance of senior notes provided cash of $2.19 billion. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company’s common stock and the payment of $76 million in cash dividends. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company's exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates has not changed materially from its exposure discussed in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended April 3, 2021, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings There are various lawsuits and claims against the company involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. See “Note 8 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – Commitments and Contingencies .” 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 1A. Risk Factors The risks that we believe are material to our investors are discussed in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 under the caption “Risk Factors,” which is on file with the SEC. Except as set forth herein, there have been no material changes during the three months ended April 3, 2021 to our previously reported Risk Factors. Risks Relating to Our Proposed Acquisition of PPD Regulatory approvals necessary for our acquisition of PPD may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the PPD acquisition. Before the PPD acquisition may be completed, we must obtain certain required regulatory approvals, waivers or consents. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the transaction. Such conditions could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the transaction, causing us to incur additional costs or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the transaction, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the transaction. Additionally, any delay in closing may adversely affect the business of PPD and therefore the combined company following the transaction, including an adverse effect on PPD’s ability to retain employees during the pendency of the transaction or on PPD’s relationships with its vendors, customers and other parties if such vendors, customers or other parties attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships, consider entering into business relationships with parties other than PPD or delay or defer decisions concerning their business with PPD during the pendency of the transaction. Combining PPD with us may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction may not be fully realized . The success of the PPD acquisition, including the realization of anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine our and PPD’s businesses. The integration may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or that the alignment of standards, controls, procedures and policies may adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, suppliers and employees or to fully achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction. The loss of key employees could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business in the markets in which PPD now operates, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. Other potential difficulties of combining our and PPD’s businesses include unanticipated issues in integrating logistics, information communications and other systems. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the PPD acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of us and PPD during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the PPD acquisition on the combined company. Risks Relating to Financial Profile We have outstanding debt, and our debt will increase as a result of additional debt we expect to incur to finance the PPD acquisition. Our existing and future indebtedness may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities and negatively impact our credit ratings. As of April 3, 2021, we had approximately $18.65 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $3.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. We expect to incur additional indebtedness to fund a portion of the purchase price of the PPD acquisition. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to 29 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) Consolidated Net Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5:1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as the impact of public health epidemics/pandemics like COVID-19, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments. Item 2.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics, deliver medicines to market and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Interim Financial Statements The interim consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared by the company, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position at September 26, 2020, the results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, and the cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2019, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain all information that is included in the annual financial statements and notes thereto of the company. The consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the 2019 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2019 describes the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes in the company’s significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 26, 2020. Contract-related Balances Accounts receivable include amounts that have been billed and are currently due from customers. They are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimates of expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on history of similarly aged receivables, the creditworthiness of the customer, reasons for delinquency, current economic conditions, expectations associated with future events and circumstances where reasonable and supportable forecasts are available and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. Receivables from academic and government customers as well as large, well-capitalized commercial customers have historically experienced less collectability risk. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers. The changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows: Nine Months Ended September 26, September 28, (In millions) 2020 2019 Balance at Beginning of Year $ 102 $ 117 Cumulative effect of accounting change 1 — Provision charged to expense 39 19 Accounts written off ( 25 ) ( 26 ) Acquisitions, currency translation and other — ( 4 ) Balance at End of Period $ 117 $ 106 Contract assets include revenues recognized in advance of billings and are recorded net of estimated losses resulting from the inability to invoice customers, which is primarily due to risk associated with the company’s performance. Contract assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the amount of time expected to lapse until the company's right to consideration 8 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) becomes unconditional. Noncurrent contract assets are included within other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. Noncurrent contract liabilities are included within other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. Contract assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheet if they arise from different performance obligations in the same contract. Contract asset and liability balances are as follows: September 26, December 31, (In millions) 2020 2019 Current Contract Assets, Net $ 697 $ 603 Noncurrent Contract Assets, Net 11 17 Current Contract Liabilities 1,047 916 Noncurrent Contract Liabilities 674 594 In the three and nine months ended September 26, 2020, the company recognized revenues of $ 142 million and $ 773 million, respectively, that were included in the contract liabilities balance at December 31, 2019. Warranty Obligations The liability for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. The changes in the carrying amount of standard product warranty obligations are as follows: Nine Months Ended September 26, September 28, (In millions) 2020 2019 Balance at Beginning of Year $ 93 $ 92 Provision charged to expense 74 80 Usage ( 76 ) ( 83 ) Adjustments to previously provided warranties, net ( 2 ) ( 1 ) Currency translation — ( 2 ) Balance at End of Period $ 89 $ 86 Inventories The components of inventories are as follows: September 26, December 31, (In millions) 2020 2019 Raw Materials $ 1,247 $ 971 Work in Process 558 517 Finished Goods 2,024 1,882 Inventories $ 3,829 $ 3,370 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company’s estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic have and will continue to materially adversely affect certain of the company’s businesses, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, in some businesses within the other three segments, through at least the fourth quarter of 2020. The extent and duration of such impacts are uncertain and may require changes to estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify the interaction of the accounting for certain equity securities, equity method investments, and certain forward contracts and purchased options. Among other things, the new guidance clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying measurement principles for certain equity securities immediately before applying or discontinuing the equity method. The company adopted this guidance in 2020 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. Among other things, the new guidance requires the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates to be reflected in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The company expects to adopt this guidance when it is effective in 2021 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future events or conditions that would be affected such as enacted changes in tax laws or rates. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 using a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 with some items requiring a prospective method and others requiring a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to require a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis, such as accounts receivable, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. During 2018 and 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 using a modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance reduced accounts receivable and retained earnings by $ 1 million on January 1, 2020. Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. Terminated Acquisition As previously announced, on March 3, 2020, the company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of QIAGEN N.V. (“QIAGEN”). Following a determination that the number of shares tendered by QIAGEN shareholders did not meet the minimum amount required for the transaction to proceed, on August 13, 2020, the company delivered to QIAGEN a written notice terminating the purchase agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement. In connection with the termination, QIAGEN paid to the company an expense reimbursement payment of $ 95 million in cash which has been recorded as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses. Disposition On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $ 1.13 billion, net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $ 482 million in 2019, included in restructuring and other costs (income), net. Revenues in 2019, through the date of sale, of the business sold were approximately $ 115 million, net of retained sales through the company's healthcare market channel business. 10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 5. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes in the accompanying statement of income differs from the provision calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before provision for income taxes due to the following: Nine Months Ended September 26, September 28, (In millions) 2020 2019 Statutory Federal Income Tax Rate 21 % 21 % Provision for Income Taxes at Statutory Rate $ 910 $ 637 Increases (Decreases) Resulting From: Foreign rate differential ( 132 ) ( 172 ) Foreign exchange loss on inter-company debt refinancing — ( 62 ) Income tax credits ( 333 ) ( 242 ) Global intangible low-taxed income 210 160 Foreign-derived intangible income ( 53 ) ( 68 ) Excess tax benefits from stock options and restricted stock units ( 94 ) ( 68 ) Basis difference on disposal of business — 72 Other, net ( 52 ) 81 Provision for Income Taxes $ 456 $ 338 The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. The company's effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate each year due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives, state and local taxes, and foreign taxes that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. In the second quarter of 2020, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $ 96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of September 26, 2020, the company had $ 1.51 billion of unrecognized tax benefits substantially all of which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: (In millions) 2020 Balance at Beginning of Year $ 1,552 Additions for tax positions of current year 6 Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 38 ) Settlements ( 7 ) Balance at End of Period $ 1,513 13 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

In connection with the termination of the agreement to acquire QIAGEN (Note 2), the company terminated the bridge and term loan commitments which had been available to fund the acquisition. The company had a cash outlay of $ 51 million in 2020 associated with obtaining the bridge and term loan commitments included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. In 2020, other expense, net includes $ 81 million of costs for the terminated QIAGEN acquisition, primarily for loan commitment fees and entering into hedging contracts. 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility, as amended, (the Facility) with a bank group that provides for up to $ 2.5 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The Facility expires in July 2022. The revolving credit agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (net debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 5.0 :1.0, with such ratio stepping down to 4.0 to 1.0 for the two consecutive fiscal quarters starting on the last day of the first fiscal quarter of 2022 and then stepping down to 3.5 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of September 26, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $ 66 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of September 26, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under these programs. Senior Notes Interest is payable annually on the euro-denominated senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. Interest Rate Swap Arrangements and related Cross-currency Interest Rate Swap Arrangements The company has entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks. The aggregate amounts of the swaps are equal to the principal amount of the notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the interest payment dates of the note. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate and receive a fixed rate. The variable interest rates reset monthly. The swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges of the notes. See Note 10 for additional information on the interest rate swap arrangements and related cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements. The following table summarizes the outstanding interest rate swap arrangements on the company's senior notes at September 26, 2020: Aggregate Notional Amount Pay Rate as of (Dollars in millions) Pay Rate September 26, 2020 Receive Rate 3.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (a) 1,000 1-month LIBOR + 1.7640 % 1.9164 % 3.00 % (a) The payments on $ 900 million notional value of these interest rate swaps are offset in part by cross-currency interest rate swaps which effectively reduced the pay rate as of September 26, 2020 from 1.92 % to a weighted average of 1.13 %. The company has entered into $ 900 million notional value of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which effectively convert a portion of the semi-annual payments related to the variable rate, U.S. dollar denominated, LIBOR-based interest rate swaps to payments on variable rate, euro denominated, EURIBOR-based cross-currency interest rate swaps. 16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including input from environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. At September 26, 2020, the company’s total environmental liability was approximately $ 70 million. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company including matters involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters. A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred. The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed below or in the company's 2019 financial statements and notes included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters For product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters, the company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of possible loss when a range of possible loss can be estimated. The company records estimated amounts due from insurers related to certain product liabilities as an asset. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. 17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Intellectual Property Matters On June 3, 2013, Unisone Strategic IP filed a complaint against Life Technologies, a subsidiary of the company, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California alleging patent infringement by Life Technologies’ supply chain management system software, which operates with product “supply centers” installed at customer sites. Plaintiff sought damages for alleged willful infringement, attorneys’ fees, costs, and injunctive relief. On September 30, 2020, this matter was settled by payment of a nominal amount by the company. Strategic Partnership and Long-term Lease In May 2020, the company entered a strategic partnership with CSL Limited (CSL). Through a long-term lease agreement with CSL, the company will operate a new state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland, when construction is completed in mid-2021, to perform pharma services for CSL with capacity to serve other customers as well. The company made an initial lease payment of $ 50 million in the second quarter of 2020 (included within other assets in the accompanying balance sheet) and expects to make additional fixed lease payments aggregating to $ 555 million (excluding renewals) from 2021 to 2041, with additional amounts dependent on the extent of revenues from customers of the facility other than CSL. Loss on Supply Agreement The Analytical Instruments segment recorded a charge to cost of product revenues for $ 108 million in the third quarter of 2020 related to an existing supply contract for components of electron microscopy instruments. The agreement requires the company to make future minimum purchases through 2025. The company has developed and launched an alternative product beginning in 2020 and based on the expected demand for the internally developed product vs. the third-party product, the company does not expect to use all of the product it will be required to buy, resulting in a loss on the purchase commitment.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with such future payments. Changes to the 19 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The majority of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and certain of its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency 21 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. The company also had $ 1 billion notional value of cross currency swaps which the company terminated in October 2020. These swaps were entered into in anticipation of using U.S. dollars to partially finance the euro purchase price of the terminated QIAGEN acquisition (Note 2). Gains and losses associated with these swaps were recorded in other expense, net. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2019 included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 7 herein for additional information on the company's risk management objectives and strategies. Cash Flow Hedge Arrangements In March 2020, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of future debt offerings. Based on the company's conclusion that the debt offerings are probable, the swaps hedge the cash flow risk for each of the interest payments on the planned fixed-rate debt issues. One of these hedges was terminated in March 2020, in connection with the debt offering completed in that month. The remaining hedges were terminated in July 2020. The aggregate fair value of the terminated hedges, net of tax, has been classified as a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive items and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt issuances. The company had cash outlays aggregating $ 85 million in 2020 associated with termination of the arrangements, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows.

Restructuring and Other Costs (Income), Net In the first nine months of 2020 the company recorded transaction/integration costs (including reimbursement thereof) related to recent/terminated acquisitions, continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, and, to a lesser extent, impairment of acquired technology in development and non-cash charges for writedowns of fixed assets to estimated disposal value in connection with the consolidation of commercial production operations in the U.S. In the first nine months of 2020, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected less than 1 % of the company’s workforce. As of October 30, 2020, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $ 45 million, primarily in 2020 and 2021, and expects to identify additional actions during 2020 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred.

The segment also recorded $ 8 million of credits to selling, general, and administrative expense for changes in estimates of contingent acquisition consideration. Analytical Instruments In the first nine months of 2020, the Analytical Instruments segment recorded $ 22 million of net restructuring and other charges, primarily for employee severance associated with headcount reductions in Europe, China, and the U.S., and, to a lesser extent, abandoned facility costs. Specialty Diagnostics In the first nine months of 2020, the Specialty Diagnostics segment recorded $ 4 million of net restructuring and other charges, principally charges for third-party transaction costs (including reimbursement thereof) for a terminated acquisition. Laboratory Products and Services In the first nine months of 2020, the Laboratory Products and Services segment recorded $ 27 million of net restructuring and other charges, primarily for employee severance at businesses streamlining operations and for writedowns of fixed assets to estimated disposal value in connection with the consolidation of commercial production operations in the U.S. Corporate In the first nine months of 2020, the company recorded $ 9 million of net restructuring and other costs for severance at its corporate operations and, to a lesser extent, charges to selling, general, and administrative expense for product liability litigation.

While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the company’s estimates change, and readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing the company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are set forth under the caption “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 (which is on file with the SEC), as updated i) by the company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 27, 2020 (which is on file with the SEC), and ii) under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this report on Form 10-Q. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties relating to: the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; the need to develop new products and adapt to significant technological change; implementation of strategies for improving growth; general economic conditions and related uncertainties, dependence on customers' capital spending policies and government funding policies; the effect of economic and political conditions and exchange rate fluctuations on international operations; use and protection of intellectual property; the effect of changes in governmental regulations; and the effect of laws and regulations governing government contracts, as well as the possibility that expected benefits related to recent or pending acquisitions may not materialize as expected. Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s operations fall into four segments (Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. The company has mobilized to support the global novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) response with products and services that help analyze, diagnose and protect from the virus. However, as the pandemic spread from China to countries worldwide, the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2020 that will materially adversely affect primarily the results of the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the company’s other three segments, at least through the fourth quarter of 2020. The extent and duration of the negative impacts are uncertain and dependent in part on customers continuing to return to work and economic activity ramping up. The company believes the impacted businesses’ long-term prospects remain excellent given the company’s attractive markets served, its industry-leading position and proven growth strategy. Several of the company’s businesses have had a significant increase in revenues due to sales of product and services addressing diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, including test kits and, to a lesser extent, products and services for therapy and vaccine development and manufacturing. While these positive impacts are expected to continue into the fourth quarter of 2020, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing demand. 25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Recent Acquisitions and Divestitures The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent acquisitions and divestitures are described below. On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $1.67 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expands the segment’s contract manufacturing capabilities. Brammer Bio reported revenues of approximately $140 million in 2018. On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $1.13 billion, net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. Revenues in 2019, through the date of sale, and the full year 2018 of the business sold were approximately $115 million and $238 million, respectively, net of retained sales through the company's healthcare market and research and safety market channel businesses.

The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $80 million in the third quarter of 2020. Sales increased $32 million due to an acquisition. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $2.14 billion (34%) primarily due to increased demand in the quarter compared to the 2019 quarter. Sales were particularly strong in diagnostic and healthcare markets, primarily due to demand for products supporting customers diagnosing the COVID-19 virus, as well as to customers in pharma and biotech markets where demand was strong for products and services and pandemic-related demand for therapies and vaccines also contributed to growth. Sales to academic and government customers grew modestly. Sales to customers in industrial markets decreased primarily due to lower demand from weakened economic conditions related to COVID-19. Sales growth was strong in each of the company’s primary geographic areas during the third quarter of 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.43 billion and 28.5%, respectively, compared with $0.95 billion and 15.1%, respectively, in 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments in 2020. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Productivity improvements are calculated net of inflationary cost increases. The company's effective tax rate was 14.2% for the third quarter of 2020. The company expects its effective tax rate for all of 2020 will be between 10% and 12% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for 26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) financial reporting purposes and are expected to total $1.20 to $1.23 billion in 2020. In the third quarter of 2019, the company’s effective tax rate was 7.6%. Net income increased to $1.93 billion in the third quarter of 2020 from $0.76 billion in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to the increase in operating income in the 2020 period (discussed above), offset in part by the increase in the income tax provision. During the first nine months of 2020, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $4.95 billion compared with $3.06 billion for 2019. The increase primarily resulted from higher cash provided by income and, to a lesser extent, lower investment in working capital in 2020. As of September 26, 2020, the company’s short-term debt totaled $2 million. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.5 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 7). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of September 26, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $66 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $7.54 billion as of September 26, 2020 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Form 10-K for 2019, describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes in the company's critical accounting policies during the first nine months of 2020. 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $80 million in 2020. Sales increased $32 million due to an acquisition. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $2.14 billion (34%) primarily due to increased demand in the quarter compared to the 2019 quarter. Sales were particularly strong in diagnostic and healthcare markets, primarily due to demand for products supporting customers diagnosing the COVID-19 virus, as well as to customers in pharma and biotech markets where demand was strong for products and services and pandemic-related demand for therapies and vaccines also contributed to growth. Sales to academic and government customers grew modestly. Sales to customers in industrial markets decreased primarily due to lower demand from weakened economic conditions related to COVID-19. Sales growth was strong in each of the company’s primary geographic areas during the third quarter of 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.43 billion and 28.5%, respectively, compared with $0.95 billion and 15.1%, respectively, in 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments in 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $37 million, including $55 million of net credits to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally third-party transaction and integration-related costs (including reimbursement thereof) for recent and terminated acquisitions and changes in estimates of contingent acquisition consideration. In addition, the company recorded $17 million of restructuring and other charges, net, for impairment of acquired technology in development, and, to a lesser extent, employee severance and other costs associated with facility consolidations/abandonments in efforts to streamline operations. See Note 12 for restructuring charges expected in future periods. In the third quarter of 2019, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $43 million, including $19 million of net charges associated with sales of businesses in prior periods, including post-closing adjustments. The company recorded $5 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company also recorded $7 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally transaction and integration-related costs for recent acquisitions. In addition, the company recorded $12 million of cash restructuring charges, primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 4). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $1.70 billion (100%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $20 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was primarily driven by demand for testing to diagnose COVID-19 with higher sales of genetic sciences products and, to a lesser extent, bioscience products. Sales also grew due to higher demand for bioproduction products. Operating income margin was 54.9% in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 34.5% in the third quarter of 2019. The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments. 29 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales decreased $41 million (-3%) due to lower revenues at existing businesses. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $19 million. The decrease in revenues at existing businesses was primarily the result of weakened economic conditions due to COVID-19 and lower sales to academic customers due to pandemic-related conditions. The contraction in sales to these customers improved significantly from the decrease reported in the second quarter of 2020. Operating income margin was 12.8% in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 23.0% in the third quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a $108 million charge related to a long-term supply contract (discussed in Note 8) and, to a lesser extent, sales mix and strategic growth investments, offset in part by productivity improvements. Specialty Diagnostics Three Months Ended September 26, September 28, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 1,430 $ 879 63 % Operating Income Margin 27.9 % 25.3 % 2.6 pt Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $551 million to $1.43 billion in the third quarter of 2020. Sales increased $541 million (62%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $10 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was due to higher demand primarily driven by products addressing treatment of COVID-19, with particular strength in sales of products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel business, and to a lesser extent, microbiology and clinical diagnostics products. Operating income margin was 27.9% in the third quarter of 2020 and 25.3% in the third quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily due to profit on higher sales, offset in part by sales mix and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments. Laboratory Products and Services Three Months Ended September 26, September 28, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 3,112 $ 2,619 19 % Operating Income Margin 11.4 % 11.6 % -0.2 pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $493 million to $3.11 billion in the third quarter of 2020. Sales increased $428 million (16%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $32 million due to an acquisition. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $33 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was primarily due to increased sales in the segment's research and safety market channel business, pharma services business and laboratory products business. Operating income margin was 11.4% in the third quarter of 2020 and 11.6% in the third quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to sales mix and strategic growth investments, offset in part by profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements. 30 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net of $39 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $12 million in the third quarter of 2019. In 2020, other expense, net includes $37 million of costs for the terminated QIAGEN acquisition, primarily for amortization of loan commitment fees. In 2019, other expense, net includes $42 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt. Provision for Income Taxes The company's effective tax rate was 14.2% for the third quarter of 2020. The company expects its effective tax rate for all of 2020 will be between 10% and 12% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total $1.20 to $1.23 billion in 2020. In the third quarter of 2019, the company’s effective tax rate was 7.6%. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. 31 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $73 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $67 million in 2020. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestiture, revenues increased $2.95 billion (16%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales were particularly strong in diagnostic and healthcare markets, primarily due to demand for products supporting customers diagnosing the COVID-19 virus, as well as to customers in pharma and biotech markets where demand was strong for products and services and pandemic-related demand for therapies and vaccines also contributed to growth. Sales to academic and government customers decreased due primarily to closure of academic labs during the global pandemic. Sales to customers in industrial markets decreased primarily due to lower demand from weakened economic conditions related to COVID-19. Sales growth was particularly strong in North America and Europe while sales grew modestly in the Asia-Pacific region. In the first nine months of 2020, total company operating income and operating income margin were $4.72 billion and 21.8%, respectively, compared with $3.36 billion and 18.0%, respectively, in the first nine months of 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business included in the 2019 period and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments in 2020. In the first nine months of 2020, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $65 million (Note 12). The company recorded $5 million of charges to cost of revenues for accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to be disposed of in connection with the consolidation of commercial production operations in the U.S., as well as charges to conform the accounting policies of a recently acquired business with the company’s accounting policies. The company recorded $7 million of net credits to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally transaction and integration-related costs (and reimbursement thereof) for recent and terminated acquisitions, as well as income for changes in estimates of contingent acquisition consideration. In addition, the company recorded $43 million of cash restructuring charges, net, primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in Europe, and the U.S. The company also recorded $24 million of charges for impairment of acquired technology in development, writedowns of fixed assets to estimated disposal value in connection with the consolidation of commercial production operations in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, environmental remediation charges for abandoned and previously owned facilities. In the first nine months of 2019, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $372 million, including $482 million of net gains on the sale of businesses, principally the Anatomical Pathology business. The company also recorded $16 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, and $54 million of net charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally transaction and integration-related costs related to acquisitions and a divestiture. In addition, the company recorded $33 million of cash restructuring charges, net, primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe. 32 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments. Analytical Instruments Nine Months Ended September 26, September 28, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 3,488 $ 4,004 (13) % Operating Income Margin 13.7 % 22.0 % -8.3 pt Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment decreased $516 million to $3.49 billion in the first nine months of 2020. Sales decreased $511 million (-13%) due to lower revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $5 million. The decrease in revenues at existing businesses was primarily the result of reduced demand from industrial customers following business slowing and closures due to COVID-19 and lower sales to academic customers due to pandemic-related closures. Operating income margin was 13.7% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 22.0% in the first nine months of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in sales, a $108 million charge related to a long-term supply contract (discussed in Note 8), sales mix and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments, offset in part by productivity improvements. Specialty Diagnostics Nine Months Ended September 26, September 28, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 3,376 $ 2,779 21 % Operating Income Margin 25.1 % 25.5 % -0.4 pt Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $597 million to $3.38 billion in the first nine months of 2020. Sales increased $724 million (26%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $6 million and the divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business decreased revenues by $121 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was due to higher demand primarily driven by products addressing treatment of COVID-19, with particular strength in sales of products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel business, and to a lesser extent, microbiology and clinical diagnostics products. Operating income margin was 25.1% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 25.5% in the first nine months of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to sales mix and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments, offset in part by profit on higher sales. 34 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services Nine Months Ended September 26, September 28, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 8,629 $ 7,765 11 % Operating Income Margin 10.8 % 12.0 % -1.2 pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $864 million to $8.63 billion in 2020. Sales increased $699 million (9%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $179 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $14 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products sold through its research and safety market channel business and, to a lesser extent, service offerings of the segment's pharma services business. Operating income margin was 10.8% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 12.0% in the first nine months of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to sales mix and strategic growth investments, offset in part by profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements. Other Income/Expense, Net The company reported other (expense) income, net of $(36) million and $25 million in the first nine months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, other expense, net includes $81 million of costs for the terminated QIAGEN acquisition, primarily for amortization of loan commitment fees and entering into currency hedging contracts. In 2019, the company recorded $42 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt. Provision for Income Taxes The company recorded a $456 million provision for income taxes in the first nine months of 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company recorded a $338 million provision for income taxes in the first nine months of 2019 including $191 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In addition, in 2019, the company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements and implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “ Recent Accounting Pronouncements ” in Note 1. Contingent Liabilities The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading “ Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters ” in Note 8 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $12.01 billion at September 26, 2020, compared with $5.70 billion at December 31, 2019. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $7.54 billion at September 26, 2020 and $2.40 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in cash was due in part to the issuance of long-term senior notes in March and April 2020. 35 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) First Nine Months of 2020 Cash provided by operating activities was $4.95 billion during the first nine months of 2020. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $858 million and $427 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities provided cash of $1.04 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $656 million during the first nine months of 2020, compared with $589 million in the first nine months of 2019. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $45 million during the first nine months of 2020. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $46 million during the first nine months of 2020. During the first nine months of 2020, the company’s investing activities used $884 million of cash, principally for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities provided $1.01 billion of cash during the first nine months of 2020. Issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $712 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock and the payment of $250 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $156 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On November 8, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. At October 30, 2020, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. The company's commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially between December 31, 2019 and September 26, 2020 except for the long-term lease with CSL Limited discussed in Note 8. The company expects that for all of 2020, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be approximately $1.5 billion. As of September 26, 2020, the company’s short-term debt totaled $2 million. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.5 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 7). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of September 26, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $66 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $7.54 billion as of September 26, 2020 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. First Nine Months of 2019 Cash provided by operating activities was $3.06 billion during the first nine months of 2019. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $321 million and $449 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $14 million primarily due to the timing of customer billings. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $589 million. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $40 million during the first nine months of 2019. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $45 million during the first nine months of 2019. During the first nine months of 2019, the company’s investing activities used $1.15 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $1.69 billion. Proceeds from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business provided $1.13 billion. The company's investing activities also included the purchase of $637 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $2.60 billion of cash during the first nine months of 2019. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $1.70 billion. A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $3 million. The company’s 36 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) financing activities also included the repurchase of $750 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $221 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $115 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company's exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates has not changed materially from its exposure discussed in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended September 26, 2020, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting. 37 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings There are various lawsuits and claims against the company involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. See “Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements – Commitments and Contingencies.” On June 3, 2013, Unisone Strategic IP filed a complaint against Life Technologies, a subsidiary of the company, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California alleging patent infringement by Life Technologies’ supply chain management system software, which operates with product “supply centers” installed at customer sites. Plaintiff sought damages for alleged willful infringement, attorneys’ fees, costs, and injunctive relief. On September 30, 2020, this matter was settled by payment of a nominal amount by the company. Item 1A. Risk Factors The risks that we believe are material to our investors are discussed in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as updated by our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 27, 2020, under the caption “Risk Factors,” which are on file with the SEC. Except as set forth herein, there have been no material changes during the three months ended September 26, 2020 to our previously reported Risk Factors. As discussed in Note 2, the company has terminated its agreement to acquire QIAGEN, therefore the risks associated with the then pending acquisition of QIAGEN included in the company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 27, 2020 are no longer material risks to the company’s operations. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities There was no share repurchase activity for the company's third quarter of 2020. On November 8, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. At September 26, 2020, $1.00 billion was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under this authorization. Item 6.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics, deliver medicines to market and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Interim Financial Statements The interim consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared by the company, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position at June 27, 2020, the results of operations for the three- and six-month periods ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, and the cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2019, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain all information that is included in the annual financial statements and notes thereto of the company. The consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the 2019 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2019 describes the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes in the company’s significant accounting policies during the six months ended June 27, 2020. Contract-related Balances Accounts receivable include amounts that have been billed and are currently due from customers. They are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimates of expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on history of similarly aged receivables, the creditworthiness of the customer, reasons for delinquency, current economic conditions, expectations associated with future events and circumstances where reasonable and supportable forecasts are available and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. Receivables from academic and government customers as well as large, well-capitalized commercial customers have historically experienced less collectability risk. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers. The changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows: Six Months Ended June 27, June 29, (In millions) 2020 2019 Balance at Beginning of Year $ 102 $ 117 Cumulative effect of accounting change 1 — Provision charged to expense 30 8 Accounts written off ( 18 ) ( 10 ) Acquisitions, currency translation and other ( 2 ) ( 2 ) Balance at End of Period $ 113 $ 113 Contract assets include revenues recognized in advance of billings and are recorded net of estimated losses resulting from the inability to invoice customers, which is primarily due to risk associated with the company’s performance. Contract assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the amount of time expected to lapse until the company's right to consideration 8 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) becomes unconditional. Noncurrent contract assets are included within other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. Noncurrent contract liabilities are included within other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. Contract assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheet if they arise from different performance obligations in the same contract. Contract asset and liability balances are as follows: June 27, December 31, (In millions) 2020 2019 Current Contract Assets, Net $ 686 $ 603 Noncurrent Contract Assets, Net 14 17 Current Contract Liabilities 975 916 Noncurrent Contract Liabilities 624 594 In the three and six months ended June 27, 2020, the company recognized revenue of $ 226 million and $ 631 million, respectively, that was included in the contract liabilities balance at December 31, 2019. Warranty Obligations The liability for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. The changes in the carrying amount of standard product warranty obligations are as follows: Six Months Ended June 27, June 29, (In millions) 2020 2019 Balance at Beginning of Year $ 93 $ 92 Provision charged to expense 41 53 Usage ( 46 ) ( 55 ) Adjustments to previously provided warranties, net ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Currency translation ( 1 ) — Balance at End of Period $ 86 $ 89 Inventories The components of inventories are as follows: June 27, December 31, (In millions) 2020 2019 Raw Materials $ 1,159 $ 971 Work in Process 533 517 Finished Goods 1,956 1,882 Inventories $ 3,648 $ 3,370 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company’s estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic will materially adversely affect certain of the company’s businesses, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, in the other three segments, through at least the third quarter of 2020. The extent and duration of such impacts are uncertain and may require changes to estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify the interaction of the accounting for certain equity securities, equity method investments, and certain forward contracts and purchased options. Among other things, the new guidance clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying measurement principles for certain equity securities immediately before applying or discontinuing the equity method. The company adopted this guidance in 2020 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. Among other things, the new guidance requires the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates to be reflected in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The company expects to adopt this guidance when it is effective in 2021 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future events or conditions that would be affected such as enacted changes in tax laws or rates. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 using a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 with some items requiring a prospective method and others requiring a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to require a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis, such as accounts receivable, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. During 2018 and 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 using a modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance reduced accounts receivable and retained earnings by $ 1 million on January 1, 2020. Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. Pending Acquisition On March 3, 2020, the company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of QIAGEN N.V. at a price of € 39 per share. On July 16, 2020, the agreement was amended to, among other things, increase the offer price to € 43 per share or approximately $ 12.7 billion (based on exchange rates at the time of the amendment), which includes the assumption of approximately $ 1.2 billion of net debt. QIAGEN is a leading provider of life science and molecular diagnostic solutions that will expand the company’s capabilities in these fields. QIAGEN reported 2019 revenues of $ 1.5 billion. The company commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of QIAGEN. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, and completion of the tender offer. The company intends to finance the purchase price, including the repayment of indebtedness of QIAGEN, with cash on hand and the net proceeds from issuances of debt. The company has also entered into a € 3.0 billion senior unsecured one-year term loan to be drawn at the closing of the QIAGEN acquisition. The company is currently evaluating other future debt financings and the timing of such transactions is subject to market and other conditions. The company also has available, but does not currently expect to utilize, up to € 6.25 billion of committed bridge financing (Note 7). 10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Disposition On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $ 1.13 billion, net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $ 505 million in the second quarter of 2019, included in restructuring and other costs (income), net. Revenues in 2019, through the date of sale, of the business sold were approximately $ 115 million, net of retained sales through the company's healthcare market channel business. Note 3.

Income Taxes The provision for income taxes in the accompanying statement of income differs from the provision calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before provision for income taxes due to the following: Six Months Ended June 27, June 29, (In millions) 2020 2019 Statutory Federal Income Tax Rate 21 % 21 % Provision for Income Taxes at Statutory Rate $ 437 $ 464 Increases (Decreases) Resulting From: Foreign rate differential ( 110 ) ( 184 ) Foreign exchange loss on inter-company debt refinancing — ( 62 ) Income tax credits ( 226 ) ( 137 ) Global intangible low-taxed income 104 134 Foreign-derived intangible income ( 29 ) ( 24 ) Withholding taxes 9 31 Transition tax and other impacts of U.S. tax reform — ( 20 ) Provision for tax reserves, net — 43 Excess tax benefits from stock options and restricted stock units ( 50 ) ( 50 ) Basis difference on disposal of business — 64 Other, net 2 17 Provision for Income Taxes $ 137 $ 276 The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. The company's effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate each year due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives, state and local taxes, and foreign taxes that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. In the second quarter of 2020, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $ 96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of June 27, 2020, the company had $ 1.55 billion of unrecognized tax benefits substantially all of which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.

See Note 10 for fair value information pertaining to the company’s long-term obligations. In connection with the agreement to acquire QIAGEN (Note 2), the company has available up to € 6.25 billion of committed bridge financing. The company intends to finance the purchase price, including the repayment of indebtedness of QIAGEN, with cash on hand and the net proceeds from issuances of debt. The company issued senior notes in March and April 2020 to partly fund the acquisition and for general corporate purposes. The company has also entered into a € 3.0 billion senior unsecured one-year term loan to be drawn at the closing of the QIAGEN acquisition. As of June 27, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the term loan. Loans under the term loan facility will be available in euros and/or dollars. The term loan agreement calls for (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Loan at a rate based on the EURIBO rate (for euro loans) or LIBO rate (for dollar loans) for the applicable interest period and (ii) each Base Rate Loan denominated in dollars at a rate based on the Base 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Rate. The term loan agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type. The financial covenants are consistent with those in the revolving credit facility described below. The company is currently evaluating future debt financings and the timing of such transactions is subject to market and other conditions. The company had a cash outlay of $ 49 million in 2020 associated with obtaining the bridge commitment included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. In 2020, other income, net includes $ 44 million of costs for the QIAGEN acquisition, primarily for entering into hedging contracts and amortization of bridge loan commitment fees. Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility, as amended, (the Facility) with a bank group that provides for up to $ 2.5 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The Facility expires in July 2022. The revolving credit agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (net debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 5.0 :1.0, with such ratio stepping down to 4.0 to 1.0 for the two consecutive fiscal quarters starting on the earlier of (a) the last day of the first fiscal quarter of 2022 and (b) the third full fiscal quarter ending after the QIAGEN acquisition closing date, and then stepping down to 3.5 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of June 27, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $ 68 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of June 27, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under these programs. Senior Notes Interest on the floating rate senior notes is payable quarterly. Interest is payable annually on the other euro-denominated senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. In 2018, Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 included in the table above. This subsidiary has no independent function other than financing activities. The Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company and no other subsidiaries of the company have guaranteed the obligations. Interest Rate Swap Arrangements and related Cross-currency Interest Rate Swap Arrangements The company has entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks. The aggregate amounts of the swaps are equal to the principal amount of the notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the interest payment dates of the note. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate and receive a fixed rate. The variable interest rates reset monthly. The swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges of the notes. See Note 10 for 16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) additional information on the interest rate swap arrangements and related cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements. The following table summarizes the outstanding interest rate swap arrangements on the company's senior notes at June 27, 2020: Aggregate Notional Amount Pay Rate as of (Dollars in millions) Pay Rate June 27, 2020 Receive Rate 3.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (a) 1,000 1-month LIBOR + 1.7640 % 1.9488 % 3.00 % (a) The payments on $ 900 million notional value of these interest rate swaps are offset in part by cross-currency interest rate swaps which effectively reduced the pay rate as of June 27, 2020 from 1.95 % to a weighted average of 1.34 %. The company has entered into $ 900 million notional value of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which effectively convert a portion of the semi-annual payments related to the variable rate, U.S. dollar denominated, LIBOR-based interest rate swaps to payments on variable rate, euro denominated, EURIBOR-based cross-currency interest rate swaps. Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including input from environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. At June 27, 2020, the company’s total environmental liability was approximately $ 71 million. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company including matters involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters. A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred. The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed below or in the company's 2019 financial statements and notes included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters For product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters, the company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of possible loss when a range of possible loss can be estimated. The company records estimated amounts due from insurers related to certain product liabilities as an asset. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. Intellectual Property Matters On June 3, 2013, Unisone Strategic IP filed a complaint against Life Technologies, a subsidiary of the company, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California alleging patent infringement by Life Technologies’ supply chain management system software, which operates with product “supply centers” installed at customer sites. Plaintiff seeks damages for alleged willful infringement, attorneys’ fees, costs, and injunctive relief. On August 24, 2017, Unisone filed an appeal from a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) that found the challenged patent claims invalid. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the PTAB’s ruling finding the challenged claims in the Unisone patent invalid. Unisone had until March 11, 2019 to file an appeal with the United States Supreme Court. Unisone did not appeal that decision, and consequently the case before the United States District Court, which had been stayed pending the outcome of the PTAB decision, resumed with Unisone filing an amended complaint on September 12, 2019 regarding similar patent claims that were not included in the PTAB proceeding. On November 1, 2019, Life Technologies filed two additional covered business method (CBM) challenges with the PTAB regarding Unisone’s new patent claims. On December 16, 2019, the United States District Court granted Life Technologies’ motion to stay the case pending the PTAB’s decision whether to institute a CBM review of the new patent claims. On April 28, 2020, the PTAB granted Life Technologies’ November 1, 2019 CBM petitions and instituted review of all of Unisone’s remaining patent claims. The PTAB has set oral argument on the CBMs for January 27, 2021. Strategic Partnership and Long-term Lease In May 2020, the company entered a strategic partnership with CSL Limited (CSL). Through a long-term lease agreement with CSL, the company will operate a new state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland, when construction is completed in mid-2021, to perform pharma services for CSL with capacity to serve other customers as well. The company made an initial lease payment of $ 50 million in the second quarter of 2020 (included within other assets in the accompanying balance sheet) and expects to make additional fixed lease payments aggregating to $ 555 million (excluding renewals) from 2021 to 2040, with additional amounts dependent on the extent of revenues from customers of the facility other than CSL. 18 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with such future payments. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs, of the contingent consideration.

The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The majority of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and certain of its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. The company has also entered into $ 1 billion notional value of cross currency swaps in anticipation of using U.S. dollars to partially finance the euro purchase price of the QIAGEN acquisition (Note 2). Gains and losses associated with these swaps are recorded in other expense, net. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2019 included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 7 herein for additional information on the company's risk management objectives and strategies. Cash Flow Hedge Arrangements In March 2020, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of future debt offerings. Based on the company's conclusion that the debt offerings are probable, the swaps hedge the cash flow risk for each of the interest payments on the planned fixed-rate debt issues. The aggregate fair value of these 22 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) hedges, net of tax, at June 27, 2020 has been classified within accumulated other comprehensive items. One of these hedges was terminated in March 2020, in connection with the debt offering completed in that month. The aggregate fair value of the terminated hedge at that time, net of tax, has been classified as a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive items and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt issuance. The company had a cash outlay of $ 62 million in 2020 associated with termination of the arrangement, included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. Subsequent to June 27, 2020, the company terminated the remaining hedges for an additional cash payment of $ 24 million.

While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the company’s estimates change, and readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing the company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report. A number of important factors could cause the results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this report on Form 10-Q. Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s operations fall into four segments (Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. The company has mobilized to support the global novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) response with products and services that help analyze, diagnose and protect from the virus. However, as the pandemic spread from China to countries worldwide, the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March and continuing into the third quarter of 2020 that will materially adversely affect primarily the results of the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the company’s other three segments, at least through the third quarter of 2020. The extent and duration of the negative impacts are uncertain and dependent in part on customers returning to work and economic activity ramping up. The company believes the impacted businesses’ long-term prospects remain excellent given the company’s attractive markets served, its industry-leading position and proven growth strategy. Several of the company’s businesses have had an increase in revenue due to sales of product addressing diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. While these positive impacts are expected to continue into the third quarter of 2020, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing demand. Recent and Pending Acquisitions and Divestiture The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent and pending acquisitions and divestitures are described below. On March 3, 2020, the company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of QIAGEN N.V. at a price of €39 per share. On July 16, 2020, the agreement was amended to, among other things, increase the offer price to €43 per share or approximately $12.7 billion (based on exchange rates at the time of the amendment), which includes the assumption of approximately $1.2 billion of net debt. QIAGEN is a leading provider of life science and molecular diagnostic solutions that will expand the company’s capabilities in these fields. QIAGEN reported 2019 revenues of $1.5 billion. The company commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of QIAGEN. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, and completion of the tender offer. 26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The company intends to finance the purchase price, including the repayment of indebtedness of QIAGEN, with cash on hand and the net proceeds from issuances of debt. The company has also entered into a €3.0 billion senior unsecured one-year term loan to be drawn at the closing of the QIAGEN acquisition. The company is currently evaluating other future debt financings and the timing of such transactions is subject to market and other conditions. The company also has available, but does not currently expect to utilize, up to €6.25 billion of committed bridge financing (Note 7). On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $1.67 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expands the segment’s contract manufacturing capabilities. Brammer Bio reported revenues of approximately $140 million in 2018. On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $1.13 billion, net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. Revenues in 2019, through the date of sale, and the full year 2018 of the business sold were approximately $115 million and $238 million, respectively, net of retained sales through the company's healthcare market and research and safety market channel businesses. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 27, June 29, June 27, June 29, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $ 2,602 37.6 % $ 1,710 27.1 % $ 4,376 33.3 % $ 3,317 26.7 % Analytical Instruments 1,051 15.2 % 1,324 21.0 % 2,152 16.4 % 2,646 21.3 % Specialty Diagnostics 988 14.3 % 943 14.9 % 1,946 14.8 % 1,900 15.3 % Laboratory Products and Services 2,787 40.3 % 2,633 41.7 % 5,517 42.0 % 5,146 41.4 % Eliminations (511) (7.4) % (294) (4.7) % (844) (6.5) % (568) (4.7) % $ 6,917 100 % $ 6,316 100 % $ 13,147 100 % $ 12,441 100 % Sales in the second quarter of 2020 were $6.92 billion, an increase of $601 million from 2019. Sales increased $5 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $82 million in the second quarter of 2020. Aside from the effects of acquisitions/divestiture and currency translation, revenues increased $678 million (11%) primarily due to increased demand in the quarter compared to the 2019 quarter. Sales were particularly strong in diagnostic and healthcare markets, primarily due to demand for products supporting customers diagnosing and treating the COVID-19 virus, as well as to customers in pharma and biotech end markets. Sales to academic and government customers decreased primarily due to closure of academic labs during the global pandemic. Sales to customers in industrial markets decreased primarily due to lower demand from business slowing and closures related to COVID-19. Sales growth was particularly strong in Europe and North America while sales were flat in the Asia-Pacific region. In the second quarter of 2020, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.39 billion and 20.1%, respectively, compared with $1.50 billion and 23.7%, respectively, in 2019. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business included in the 2019 period and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments in 2020, offset in part by profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements and sales mix. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Productivity improvements are calculated net of inflationary cost increases. The company's effective tax rate was 7.8% for the second quarter of 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company expects its effective tax rate for all of 2020 will be between 7% and 9% 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total $550 to $600 million in 2020. In the second quarter of 2019, the company’s effective tax rate was 19.7%. The second quarter 2019 provision for income taxes included $187 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business and a tax provision of $28 million to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform based on final regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in June 2019. In addition, in the second quarter of 2019, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. Net income increased to $1.16 billion in the second quarter of 2020 from $1.12 billion in the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to the decrease in income tax provision (discussed above) and a decrease in interest expense, offset in part by the decrease in operating income in the 2020 period (discussed above) and a decrease in interest income. During the first six months of 2020, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $2.24 billion compared with $1.94 billion for 2019. The increase primarily resulted from higher cash provided by income, offset in part by higher investment in working capital in 2020. As of June 27, 2020, the company’s short-term debt totaled $675 million, consisting principally of senior notes due in August 2020. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.5 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of June 27, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $68 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $5.82 billion as of June 27, 2020 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, term loan agreement and bridge loan agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of funding of the QIAGEN acquisition and the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Form 10-K for 2019, describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes in the company's critical accounting policies during the first six months of 2020. 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $5 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $82 million in 2020. Aside from the effects of acquisitions, a divestiture and currency translation, revenues increased $678 million (11%) primarily due to increased demand in the quarter compared to the 2019 quarter. Sales were particularly strong in diagnostic and healthcare markets, primarily due to demand for products supporting customers diagnosing and treating the COVID-19 virus, as well as to customers in pharma and biotech end markets. Sales to academic and government customers decreased primarily due to closure of academic labs during the global pandemic. Sales to customers in industrial markets decreased primarily due to lower demand from business slowing and closures related to COVID-19. Sales growth was particularly strong in Europe and North America while sales were flat in the Asia-Pacific region. In the second quarter of 2020, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.39 billion and 20.1%, respectively, compared with $1.50 billion and 23.7%, respectively, in 2019. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business included in the 2019 period and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments in 2020, offset in part by profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements and sales mix. In the second quarter of 2020, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $56 million. The company recorded $2 million of charges to cost of revenues for accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to be disposed of in connection with the consolidation of commercial production operations in the U.S. The company also recorded $42 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally third-party transaction and integration-related costs for recent and pending acquisitions. In addition, the company recorded $12 million of restructuring and other charges, net, for employee severance and other costs associated with facility consolidations/abandonments in efforts to streamline operations, and, to a lesser extent, environmental remediation costs at abandoned and previously owned facilities. See Note 12 for restructuring charges expected in future periods. In the second quarter of 2019, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $443 million, including $505 million of gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. The company recorded $5 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company also recorded $36 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally transaction costs related to acquisitions. In addition, the company recorded $11 million of cash restructuring charges, primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe. The company also recorded $6 million of charges for the impairment of acquired technology in development. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ 29 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 4). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.

Life Sciences Solutions Three Months Ended June 27, June 29, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 2,602 $ 1,710 52 % Operating Income Margin 47.4 % 35.6 % 11.8 pt Sales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $892 million to $2.60 billion in the second quarter of 2020. Sales increased $936 million (55%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $44 million. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased sales of genetic sciences products, driven primarily by tests for diagnosis of COVID-19. Sales grew, to a lesser extent, due to higher demand for biosciences and bioproduction products. 30 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Operating income margin was 47.4% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 35.6% in the second quarter of 2019. The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix and productivity improvements offset in part by strategic growth investments. Analytical Instruments Three Months Ended June 27, June 29, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 1,051 $ 1,324 (21) % Operating Income Margin 12.9 % 21.6 % -8.7 pt Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment decreased $273 million to $1.05 billion in the second quarter of 2020. Sales decreased $262 million (-20%) due to lower revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $11 million. The decrease in revenue at existing businesses was primarily the result of reduced demand from industrial customers following business slowing and closures due to COVID-19 and lower sales to academic customers due to pandemic-related closures. Operating income margin was 12.9% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 21.6% in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix and strategic growth investments, offset in part by productivity improvements. Specialty Diagnostics Three Months Ended June 27, June 29, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 988 $ 943 5 % Operating Income Margin 21.6 % 25.7 % -4.1 pt Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $45 million to $988 million in the second quarter of 2020. Sales increased $109 million (12%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business resulted in a decrease in sales of $57 million. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $7 million. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was due to higher demand in part driven by products addressing treatment of COVID-19, with particular strength in sales of products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel business, and to a lesser extent, clinical diagnostics and microbiology products. Operating income margin was 21.6% in the second quarter of 2020 and 25.7% in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to sales mix and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments, offset in part by profit on higher sales and productivity improvements. Laboratory Products and Services Three Months Ended June 27, June 29, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 2,787 $ 2,633 6 % Operating Income Margin 10.1 % 13.1 % -3.0 pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $154 million to $2.79 billion in the second quarter of 2020. Sales increased $121 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $55 million due to acquisitions. The 31 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $22 million. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for service offerings of the segment's pharma services business. Operating income margin was 10.1% in the second quarter of 2020 and 13.1% in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to sales mix and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments, offset in part by profit on higher sales and productivity improvements. Other Income/Expense, Net The company reported other expense of $9 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to other income of $18 million in the second quarter of 2019. In 2020, other expense, net includes $27 million of costs for the QIAGEN acquisition, primarily for amortization of bridge loan commitment fees and entering into currency hedging contracts. Provision for Income Taxes The company's effective tax rate was 7.8% for the second quarter of 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company expects its effective tax rate for all of 2020 will be between 7% and 9% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total $550 to $600 million in 2020. In the second quarter of 2019, the company’s effective tax rate was 19.7%. The second quarter 2019 provision for income taxes included $187 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business and a tax provision of $28 million to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform based on final regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in June 2019. In addition, in the second quarter of 2019, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.

Sales increased $41 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $147 million in 2020. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestiture, revenues increased $812 million (7%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales were particularly strong in diagnostic and healthcare markets, primarily due to demand for products supporting customers diagnosing and treating the COVID-19 virus, as well as to customers in pharma and biotech end markets. Sales to academic and government customers decreased due primarily 32 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) to closure of academic labs during the global pandemic. Sales to customers in industrial markets decreased primarily due to lower demand from business slowing and closures related to COVID-19. Sales growth was particularly strong in Europe and North America while sales decreased in the Asia-Pacific region. In the first six months of 2020, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.30 billion and 17.5%, respectively, compared with $2.42 billion and 19.4%, respectively, in the first six months of 2019. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business included in the 2019 period and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments in 2020, offset in part by profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements. In the first six months of 2020, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $102 million. The company recorded $4 million of charges to cost of revenues to conform the accounting policies of a recently acquired business with the company’s accounting policies, as well as accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to be disposed of in connection with the consolidation of commercial production operations in the U.S. The company recorded $48 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally transaction and integration-related costs for recent and pending acquisitions. In addition, the company recorded $37 million of cash restructuring charges, net, primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in Europe, and the U.S. The company also recorded $13 million of charges for writedowns of fixed assets to estimated disposal value in connection with the consolidation of commercial production operations in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, environmental remediation charges for abandoned and previously owned facilities (Note 12). In the first six months of 2019, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $415 million, including $505 million of gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. The company also recorded $11 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, and $47 million of net charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally transaction costs related to acquisitions and a divestiture. In addition, the company recorded $21 million of cash restructuring charges, net, primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe. 33 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $1.12 billion (34%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $64 million. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased 34 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) sales of genetic sciences products, driven primarily by tests for diagnosis of COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, higher demand for bioproduction and biosciences products. Operating income margin was 43.6% in the first six months of 2020 compared to 35.3% in the first six months of 2019. The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales. Analytical Instruments Six Months Ended June 27, June 29, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 2,152 $ 2,646 (19) % Operating Income Margin 14.2 % 21.4 % -7.2 pt Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment decreased $494 million to $2.15 billion in the first six months of 2020. Sales decreased $470 million (-18%) due to lower revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $24 million. The decrease in revenue at existing businesses was primarily the result of reduced demand from industrial customers following business slowing and closures due to COVID-19 and lower sales to academic customers due to pandemic-related closures. Operating income margin was 14.2% in the first six months of 2020 compared to 21.4% in the first six months of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by productivity improvements. Specialty Diagnostics Six Months Ended June 27, June 29, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 1,946 $ 1,900 2 % Operating Income Margin 23.1 % 25.5 % -2.4 pt Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $46 million to $1.95 billion in the first six months of 2020. Sales increased $183 million (10%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $16 million and the divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business decreased revenue by $121 million. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was due to higher demand in part driven by products addressing treatment of COVID-19, with particular strength in sales of products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel business, and to a lesser extent, clinical diagnostics products. Operating income margin was 23.1% in the first six months of 2020 compared to 25.5% in the first six months of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to sales mix offset in part by profit on higher sales and productivity improvements. Laboratory Products and Services Six Months Ended June 27, June 29, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 5,517 $ 5,146 7 % Operating Income Margin 10.4 % 12.2 % -1.8 pt 35 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $371 million to $5.52 billion in 2020. Sales increased $271 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $147 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $47 million. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for service offerings of the segment's pharma services business and to a lesser extent, products sold through its research and safety market channel business. Operating income margin was 10.4% in the first six months of 2020 compared to 12.2% in the first six months of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to sales mix and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments, offset in part by profit on higher sales and productivity improvements. Other Income, Net The company reported other income, net of $3 million and $37 million in the first six months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, other income, net includes $44 million of costs for the QIAGEN acquisition, primarily for entering into currency hedging contracts and amortization of bridge loan commitment fees. Provision for Income Taxes The company recorded a $137 million provision for income taxes in the first six months of 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company recorded a $276 million provision for income taxes in the first six months of 2019 including $187 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In addition, in 2019, the company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements and implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “ Recent Accounting Pronouncements ” in Note 1. Contingent Liabilities The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the headings “ Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters ” and “ Intellectual Property Matters ” in Note 8 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $9.76 billion at June 27, 2020, compared with $5.70 billion at December 31, 2019. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $5.82 billion at June 27, 2020 and $2.40 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in cash was due in part to the issuance of long-term senior notes in March and April 2020 to partially fund the QIAGEN acquisition and for general corporate purposes (see Note 7). First Six Months of 2020 Cash provided by operating activities was $2.24 billion during the first six months of 2020. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $195 million and $309 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities provided cash of $303 million primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes decreased to $320 million during the first six months of 2020, compared with $417 million in the first six months of 2019. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $36 million during the first six months of 2020. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $33 million during the first six months of 2020. During the first six months of 2020, the company’s investing activities used $519 million of cash, principally for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. 36 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company’s financing activities provided $1.80 billion of cash during the first six months of 2020. Issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock and the payment of $163 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $125 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On November 8, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. At July 31, 2020, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. The company's commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially between December 31, 2019 and June 27, 2020 except for the agreement to acquire QIAGEN, discussed in Note 2 and the long-term lease with CSL Limited discussed in Note 8. The company expects that for all of 2020, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. In July 2020, in connection with the amended offer to acquire QIAGEN, the company transferred $1.75 billion of cash to a restricted cash account where it will be held pending use of it for payment of the acquisition consideration. As of June 27, 2020, the company’s short-term debt totaled $675 million, consisting principally of senior notes due in August 2020. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.5 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of June 27, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $68 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $5.82 billion as of June 27, 2020 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, term loan agreement and bridge loan agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of funding of the QIAGEN acquisition and the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. First Six Months of 2019 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.94 billion during the first six months of 2019. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in inventories used cash of $273 million primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities provided cash of $140 million primarily due to the timing of customer billings. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $417 million. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $34 million during the first six months of 2019. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $34 million during the first six months of 2019. During the first six months of 2019, the company’s investing activities used $950 million of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $1.69 billion. Proceeds from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business provided $1.13 billion. The company's investing activities also included the purchase of $421 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $735 million of cash during the first six months of 2019. The company’s financing activities included the repurchase of $750 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $144 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $122 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $40 million. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company's exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates has not changed materially from its exposure at year-end 2019. 37 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2020, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings There are various lawsuits and claims against the company involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. See “Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements – Commitments and Contingencies.” Item 1A. Risk Factors Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 26 . We are subject to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) that has spread globally. The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty and worldwide economic disruption. It is likely that the pandemic will cause an economic slowdown of potentially extended duration, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. COVID-19 is having, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on certain of our operations, supply chains and distribution systems, including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. Due to these impacts and measures, we have experienced, and will continue to experience, significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products. Many employers in the United States and Europe are continuing to require their employees to work from home or not go into their offices. If the pandemic continues and conditions worsen, we will continue to experience a decline in sales activities and customer orders in certain of our businesses, and it remains uncertain what impact these declines will have on future sales and customer orders once conditions begin to improve. In addition to existing travel restrictions, countries may continue to close or decline to reopen borders, impose prolonged quarantines, and further restrict travel, which would significantly impact our ability to support our sites and customers in those locations and the ability of our employees to get to their places of work to produce products, or significantly hamper our products from moving through the supply chain. As a result, COVID-19 will materially adversely affect revenue growth in certain of our businesses, and it is uncertain how materially COVID-19 will affect our global operations generally if these impacts persist or worsen over an extended period of time. The extent and duration of the impacts are uncertain and dependent in part on customers returning to work and economic activity ramping up. The company has mobilized to support the COVID-19 response with products and services that help diagnose the virus as well as assisting customers to develop potential therapeutics and vaccines used to protect from the virus. Our ability to continue to manufacture products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our factory employees. The ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19. While we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our employees, these measures may not be successful, and we may be required to temporarily close facilities or take other measures. While we are staying in close communication with our sites, employees, customers and suppliers and acting to mitigate the impact of this dynamic and evolving situation, the duration and extent of the effect of COVID-19 on the company is not determinable. 38 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) In addition, several of the company’s businesses have had an increase in revenue due to sales of products addressing diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. While these positive impacts are expected to continue into the third quarter of 2020, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing demand. We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive. Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue. It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including: • strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; • allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; • developing new applications for our technologies; • expanding our service offerings; • continuing key customer initiatives; • combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively; • finding new markets for our products; and • continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings. We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business. Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, continue to be unstable (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of • reducing demand for some of our products; • increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays; • increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; • increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services; • causing supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; and • creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds. Our growth would suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline 39 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) or lower than expected growth in our served markets would diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies. Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget. An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending. Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations. International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the “functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. As our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In the first six months of 2020, currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $147 million on revenues due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: • interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; • changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions; • changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers; • tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs recently adopted by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods; • the impact of public health epidemics/pandemics on the global economy, such as COVID-19 that has spread globally; • negative consequences from changes in tax laws; • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; • differing labor regulations; • differing protection of intellectual property; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and • geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war. For example, on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union, or EU and entered a transition period during which it will negotiate a trade deal with the EU. This withdrawal has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years. Our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU. In addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the United Kingdom. These possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, may adversely affect our operating results and our customers’ businesses. 40 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, we manufacture pharmaceuticals and many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products. Our pharma services offerings are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers, our business could suffer. Our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements. Our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our quality management strategy and systems, and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. A failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products. In each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether. In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such failure could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers for lost drug product, registered intermediates, registered starting materials, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, other customer claims, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. Production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high. If problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market, we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of which could be significant. 41 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) We are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. We may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers. Additionally, products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Certain acquisitions, including the QIAGEN acquisition (Note 2), may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company. Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business. Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $25.70 billion and $1.25 billion, respectively, as of June 27, 2020. In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $11.92 billion as of June 27, 2020. We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. We assess the realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us. Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor. Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us. In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers. We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers. Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us. Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe. We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work 42 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected. We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies. We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (the FDA), the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS), the European Medicines Agency (the EMA), in Europe, the EU member states and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale. The manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices and pharma services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. We are the sole manufacturer of a number of pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers' ability to provide products to their customers. We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We have internal controls and compliance systems to protect the company against acts committed by employees, agents or businesses that we acquire that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy, but we cannot provide assurance that these controls and systems will prevent every such wrongful act. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies which we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements. Natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may disrupt our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, and could impact customer 43 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) spending. We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk. An earthquake or other natural disaster such as a fire or hurricane or power shortages or outages could disrupt our operations or impair our critical systems. Any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control, such as strikes or other labor unrest, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing or warehouse facilities, or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict, or other events outside of our control, such as strikes or other labor unrest, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact customer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally, which could also adversely impact our operating results. For example, as described above, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flows. Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel. While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs. Our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials or components could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. Some of our businesses purchase certain materials from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues such as COVID-19, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies. A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business. As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We also rely on our information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners) and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as interacting with suppliers, selling our products and services, fulfilling orders and billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers, tracking customer activity, fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise conducting business). Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, phishing, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results. Any of the cyber-attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above, if significant, could materially interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. 44 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation imposes significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data. Several countries, such as China and Russia, have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. We have outstanding debt, and our debt will increase as a result of additional debt we expect to incur to finance the QIAGEN acquisition. Our existing and future indebtedness may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities and negatively impact our credit ratings. As of June 27, 2020, we had approximately $21.31 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $2.5 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. We expect to incur additional indebtedness to fund a portion of the purchase price of the QIAGEN acquisition. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants in the Facility include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (net debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 5.0:1.0, with such ratio stepping down to 4.0 to 1.0 for the two consecutive fiscal quarters starting on the earlier of (a) the last day of the first fiscal quarter of 2022 and (b) the third full fiscal quarter ending after the QIAGEN acquisition closing date, and then stepping down to 3.5 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0:1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as the impact of public health epidemics/pandemics like COVID-19, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments. Regulatory approvals necessary for our acquisition of QIAGEN may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the QIAGEN acquisition . Before the QIAGEN acquisition may be completed, we must obtain certain required regulatory approvals, waivers or consents. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the transaction. Such conditions could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the transaction, causing us to incur 45 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) additional costs or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the transaction, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the transaction. Combining QIAGEN with us may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction may not be fully realized. The success of the QIAGEN acquisition, including the realization of anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine our and QIAGEN’s businesses. The integration may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or that the alignment of standards, controls, procedures and policies may adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, suppliers and employees or to fully achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction. The loss of key employees could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business in the markets in which QIAGEN now operates, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and the price of the notes. Other potential difficulties of combining our and QIAGEN’s businesses include unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information communications and other systems. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the QIAGEN acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of us and QIAGEN during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the QIAGEN acquisition on the combined company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics, deliver medicines to market and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Interim Financial Statements The interim consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared by the company, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position at March 28, 2020, the results of operations for the three-month periods ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, and the cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2019, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain all information that is included in the annual financial statements and notes thereto of the company. The consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the 2019 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2019 describes the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes in the company’s significant accounting policies during the three months ended March 28, 2020. Contract-related Balances Accounts receivable include amounts that have been billed and are currently due from customers. They are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimates of expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on history of similarly aged receivables, the creditworthiness of the customer, reasons for delinquency, current economic conditions, expectations associated with future events and circumstances where reasonable and supportable forecasts are available and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. Receivables from academic and government customers as well as large, well-capitalized commercial customers have historically experienced less collectability risk. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers. The changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows: Three Months Ended March 28, March 30, (In millions) 2020 2019 Beginning Balance $ 102 $ 117 Cumulative effect of accounting change 1 — Provision charged to expense 10 2 Accounts written off ( 11 ) ( 5 ) Acquisitions, currency translation and other ( 1 ) — Ending Balance $ 101 $ 114 Contract assets include revenues recognized in advance of billings and are recorded net of estimated losses resulting from the inability to invoice customers, which is primarily due to risk associated with the company’s performance. Contract assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the amount of time expected to lapse until the company's right to consideration 8 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) becomes unconditional. Noncurrent contract assets are included within other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. Noncurrent contract liabilities are included within other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. Contract assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheet if they arise from different performance obligations in the same contract. Contract asset and liability balances are as follows: March 28, December 31, (In millions) 2020 2019 Current Contract Assets, Net $ 658 $ 603 Noncurrent Contract Assets, Net 17 17 Current Contract Liabilities 938 916 Noncurrent Contract Liabilities 617 594 In the first three months of 2020, the company recognized revenue of $ 405 million that was included in the contract liabilities balance at December 31, 2019. Warranty Obligations The liability for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. The changes in the carrying amount of standard product warranty obligations are as follows: Three Months Ended March 28, March 30, (In millions) 2020 2019 Beginning Balance $ 93 $ 92 Provision charged to expense 22 27 Usage ( 25 ) ( 28 ) Adjustments to previously provided warranties, net — ( 1 ) Currency translation ( 1 ) — Ending Balance $ 89 $ 90 Inventories The components of inventories are as follows: March 28, December 31, (In millions) 2020 2019 Raw Materials $ 1,069 $ 971 Work in Process 503 517 Finished Goods 1,882 1,882 Inventories $ 3,454 $ 3,370 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company’s estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic will materially adversely affect the company’s operations through at 9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) least the second quarter of 2020. The extent and duration of such impacts are uncertain and may require changes to estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2020, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify the interaction of the accounting for certain equity securities, equity method investments, and certain forward contracts and purchased options. Among other things, the new guidance clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying measurement principles for certain equity securities immediately before applying or discontinuing the equity method. The company adopted this guidance in 2020 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. Among other things, the new guidance requires the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates to be reflected in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The company expects to adopt this guidance when it is effective in 2021 using a prospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements; however, the impact in future periods will be dependent on the extent of future events or conditions that would be affected such as enacted changes in tax laws or rates. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 using a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 with some items requiring a prospective method and others requiring a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to require a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis, such as accounts receivable, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. During 2018 and 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company adopted the guidance in 2020 using a modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance reduced accounts receivable and retained earnings by $ 1 million on January 1, 2020. Note 2. Acquisitions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. Pending Acquisition On March 3, 2020, the company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of QIAGEN N.V. at a price of € 39.00 per share or approximately $ 11.5 billion (based on exchange rates at the time of the announcement), which includes the assumption of approximately $ 1.4 billion of net debt. QIAGEN is a leading provider of life science and molecular diagnostic solutions that will expand the company’s capabilities in these fields. QIAGEN reported 2019 revenues of $ 1.5 billion. The company will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of QIAGEN. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, the adoption of certain resolutions relating to the transaction at an Extraordinary General Meeting of QIAGEN’s shareholders, and completion of the tender offer. The company intends to finance the purchase price, including the repayment of indebtedness of QIAGEN, with cash on hand and the net proceeds from issuances of debt. The company is currently evaluating future debt financings and the timing of 10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) In connection with the agreement to acquire QIAGEN (Note 2), the company obtained, but does not currently expect to utilize, up to € 9.25 billion of committed financing. The company intends to finance the purchase price, including the repayment of indebtedness of QIAGEN, with cash on hand and the net proceeds from issuances of debt. The company issued senior notes in March and April 2020 (Note 13) to partly fund the acquisition and for general corporate purposes. The company is currently evaluating future debt financings and the timing of such transactions is subject to market and other conditions. The company had a cash outlay of $ 36 million in 2020 associated with obtaining the bridge commitment included in other financing activities, net, in the accompanying statement of cash flows. In 2020, other income, net includes $ 17 million of costs for the QIAGEN acquisition, primarily for entering into hedging contracts and amortization of bridge loan commitment fees. Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides for up to $ 2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The facility expires in July 2021. The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of March 28, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $ 71 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of March 28, 2020, outstanding borrowings under these programs were $ 66 million with a weighted average remaining period to maturity of 31 days and are classified as short-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet. Senior Notes Interest on the floating rate senior notes is payable quarterly. Interest is payable annually on the other euro-denominated senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. In 2018, Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 included in the table above. This subsidiary has no independent function other than financing activities. The Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company and no other subsidiaries of the company have guaranteed the obligations. Interest Rate Swap Arrangements and related Cross-currency Interest Rate Swap Arrangements The company has entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks. The aggregate amounts of the swaps are equal to the principal amount of the notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the interest payment dates of the note. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate and receive a fixed rate. The variable interest rates reset monthly. The swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges of the notes. See Note 10 for additional information on the interest rate swap arrangements and related cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements. The following table summarizes the outstanding interest rate swap arrangements on the company's senior notes at March 28, 2020: 16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Aggregate Notional Amount Pay Rate as of (Dollars in millions) Pay Rate March 28, 2020 Receive Rate 3.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (a) 1,000 1-month LIBOR + 1.7640 % 2.4686 % 3.00 % (a) The payments on $ 900 million notional value of these interest rate swaps are offset in part by cross-currency interest rate swaps which effectively reduced the pay rate as of March 28, 2020 from 2.47 % to a weighted average of 1.17 %. The company has entered into $ 900 million notional value of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which effectively convert a portion of the semi-annual payments related to the variable rate, U.S. dollar denominated, LIBOR-based interest rate swaps to payments on variable rate, euro denominated, EURIBOR-based cross-currency interest rate swaps. Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including input from environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. At March 28, 2020, the company’s total environmental liability was approximately $ 70 million. While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company including matters involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters. A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred. The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed below or in the company's 2019 financial statements and notes included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters For product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters, the company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of possible loss when a range of possible loss can be estimated. The company records estimated amounts due from insurers related to certain product liabilities as an asset. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. Intellectual Property Matters On June 3, 2013, Unisone Strategic IP filed a complaint against Life Technologies, a subsidiary of the company, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California alleging patent infringement by Life Technologies’ supply chain management system software, which operates with product “supply centers” installed at customer sites. Plaintiff seeks damages for alleged willful infringement, attorneys’ fees, costs, and injunctive relief. On August 24, 2017, Unisone filed an appeal from a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) that found the challenged patent claims invalid. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the PTAB’s ruling finding the challenged claims in the Unisone patent invalid. Unisone had until March 11, 2019 to file an appeal with the United States Supreme Court. Unisone did not appeal that decision, and consequently the case before the United States District Court, which had been stayed pending the outcome of the PTAB decision, resumed with Unisone filing an amended complaint on September 12, 2019 regarding similar patent claims that were not included in the PTAB proceeding. On November 1, 2019, Life Technologies filed two additional covered business method (CBM) challenges with the PTAB regarding Unisone’s new patent claims. On December 16, 2019, the United States District Court granted Life Technologies’ motion to stay the case pending the PTAB’s decision whether to institute a CBM review of the new patent claims. On April 28, 2020, the PTAB granted Life Technologies’ November 1, 2019 CBM petitions and instituted review of all of Unisone’s remaining patent claims. Note 9.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) The company uses the Black-Scholes model to value its warrants. The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with such future payments. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense.

The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The majority of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and certain of its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. 21 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) The company has also entered into $ 1 billion notional value of cross currency swaps in anticipation of U.S. dollar term loan borrowings to partially finance the euro purchase price of the QIAGEN acquisition (Note 2). Gains and losses associated with these swaps are recorded in other expense, net. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2019 included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 7 herein for additional information on the company's risk management objectives and strategies. Cash Flow Hedge Arrangements In March 2020, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of future debt offerings. Based on the company's conclusion that the debt offerings are probable, the swaps hedge the cash flow risk for each of the interest payments on the planned fixed-rate debt issues. The aggregate fair value of these hedges, net of tax, at March 28, 2020 has been classified as a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive items. One of these hedges was terminated in March 2020, in connection with the debt offering completed in that month.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding: projections of revenue, expenses, earnings, margins, tax rates, tax provisions, cash flows, pension and benefit obligations and funding requirements, our liquidity position; cost reductions, restructuring activities, new product and service developments, competitive strengths or market position, acquisitions or divestitures; growth, declines and other trends in markets we sell into; new or modified laws, regulations and accounting pronouncements; outstanding claims, legal proceedings, tax audits and assessments and other contingent liabilities; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; general economic and capital markets conditions; the timing of any of the foregoing; assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; and any other statements that address events or developments that Thermo Fisher intends or believes will or may occur in the future. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements are accompanied by such words. While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the company’s estimates change, and readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing the company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report. A number of important factors could cause the results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this report on Form 10-Q. Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s operations fall into four segments (Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. The company has mobilized to support the global novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) response with products and services that help analyze, diagnose and protect from the virus. However, as the pandemic spread from China to countries worldwide, the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity by late March and into the second quarter of 2020 that will materially adversely affect the company’s results at least through the second quarter of 2020. The extent and duration of the impacts are uncertain and dependent in part on customers returning to work and economic activity ramping up. The company believes its long-term prospects remain excellent given the attractive markets served, its industry-leading position and proven growth strategy. Recent and Pending Acquisitions and Divestiture The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent and pending acquisitions and divestitures are described below. On March 3, 2020, the company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of QIAGEN N.V. at a price of €39.00 per share or approximately $11.5 billion (based on exchange rates at the time of the announcement), which includes the assumption of approximately $1.4 billion of net debt. QIAGEN is a leading provider of life science and molecular diagnostic solutions that will expand the company’s capabilities in these fields. QIAGEN reported 2019 revenues of $1.5 billion. The company will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of QIAGEN. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, the adoption of certain resolutions relating to the transaction at an Extraordinary General Meeting of QIAGEN’s shareholders, and completion of the tender offer. The company intends to finance the purchase price, including the repayment of indebtedness of QIAGEN, with cash on hand and the net proceeds from issuances of debt. The company is currently evaluating future debt financings and the timing of such transactions is subject to market and other conditions. The company also has available, but does not currently expect to utilize, up to €9.25 billion of committed financing (Note 7). 25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $1.67 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expands the segment’s contract manufacturing capabilities. Brammer Bio reported revenues of approximately $140 million in 2018. On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $1.13 billion, net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. Revenues in 2019, through the date of sale, and the full year 2018 of the business sold were approximately $115 million and $238 million, respectively, net of retained sales through the company's healthcare market and research and safety market channel businesses. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity Three Months Ended March 28, March 30, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $ 1,774 28.5 % $ 1,607 26.2 % Analytical Instruments 1,101 17.7 % 1,322 21.6 % Specialty Diagnostics 958 15.4 % 957 15.6 % Laboratory Products and Services 2,730 43.8 % 2,513 41.0 % Eliminations (333) (5.4) % (274) (4.4) % $ 6,230 100 % $ 6,125 100 % Sales in the first quarter of 2020 were $6.23 billion, an increase of $105 million from 2019. Sales increased $35 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $65 million in the first quarter of 2020. Aside from the effects of acquisitions/divestiture and currency translation, revenues increased $135 million (2%) primarily due to increased demand in the quarter compared to the 2019 quarter. Sales were particularly strong to customers in diagnostic and healthcare markets, driven in part by demand for products supporting those diagnosing and treating the COVID-19 virus, as well as to customers in pharma and biotech end markets. Sales to academic and government customers decreased due primarily to closure of academic labs, initially in China and then globally as the quarter progressed. Sales to customers in industrial markets decreased primarily due to lower demand in China from business slowing and closures related to COVID-19 as well as strong comparative sales in the first quarter of 2019. The first quarter of 2020 had one less selling day than the first quarter of 2019 which reduced revenues by nearly 1%. Sales growth was particularly strong in Europe and, to a lesser extent, North America while sales decreased in the Asia-Pacific region. In the first quarter of 2020, total company operating income and operating income margin were $906 million and 14.5%, respectively, compared with $920 million and 15.0%, respectively, in 2019. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, sales mix and dilution following the June 2019 divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business. These decreases were offset in part by productivity improvements and profit on higher sales. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. The company has begun implementing additional cost reduction measures in response to impacts of COVID-19 on the business. Productivity improvements are calculated net of inflationary cost increases. The company's effective tax rate was 4.8% for the first quarter of 2020. The company expects its effective tax rate for all of 2020 will be between 7% and 9% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for 26 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) financial reporting purposes and are expected to total $450 to $500 million in 2020. In the first quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $2 million provision for income taxes, net of a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements. In addition, the company recorded a net tax benefit of $27 million in the first quarter of 2019, to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform based on final regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in January 2019. Net income decreased to $788 million in the first quarter of 2020 from $815 million in the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to the increase in income tax provision (discussed above), a decrease in interest income, and the decrease in operating income in the 2020 period (discussed above), offset in part by a decrease in interest expense. During the first three months of 2020, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $356 million compared with $649 million for 2019. The decrease primarily resulted from higher investment in working capital in 2020. As of March 28, 2020, the company’s short-term debt totaled $738 million consisting principally of senior notes due in August 2020. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of March 28, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $71 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $2.98 billion as of March 28, 2020, debt proceeds of $1.3 billion in April 2020 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement and bridge loan agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses and funding of the QIAGEN acquisition for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Form 10-K for 2019, describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes in the company's critical accounting policies during the first three months of 2020. 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $35 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $65 million in 2020. Aside from the effects of acquisitions/divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $135 million (2%) primarily due to increased demand in the quarter compared to the 2019 quarter. Sales were particularly strong to customers in diagnostic and healthcare markets, driven in part by demand for products supporting those diagnosing and treating the COVID-19 virus, as well as to customers in pharma and biotech end markets. Sales to academic and government customers decreased due primarily to closure of academic labs, initially in China and then globally as the quarter progressed.

The first quarter of 2020 had one less selling day than the first quarter of 2019 which reduced revenues by nearly 1%. Sales growth was particularly strong in Europe and, to a lesser extent, North America while sales decreased in the Asia-Pacific region. In the first quarter of 2020, total company operating income and operating income margin were $906 million and 14.5%, respectively, compared with $920 million and 15.0%, respectively, in 2019. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, sales mix and dilution following the June 2019 divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business. These decreases were offset in part by productivity improvements and profit on higher sales. In the first quarter of 2020, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $46 million. The company recorded $2 million of charges to cost of revenues to conform the accounting policies of a recently acquired business to the company’s accounting policies. The company also recorded $6 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally third-party transaction and integration-related costs for recent and pending acquisitions. In addition, the company recorded $38 million restructuring and other charges, net, primarily for employee severance and other costs associated with facility consolidations in efforts to streamline operations. See Note 12 for restructuring charges expected in future periods. In the first quarter of 2019, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $28 million, including $6 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company recorded $11 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, for third-party transaction costs related to recent acquisitions and a divestiture. The company recorded $11 million of cash restructuring costs, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 4). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $187 million (12%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $20 million. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased 29 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) demand in each of the segment's principal businesses with particular strength in sales of genetic sciences, driven primarily by products addressing diagnosis of COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, bioproduction products. Operating income margin was 38.0% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 34.9% in the first quarter of 2019. The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales, offset in part by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, sales mix. Analytical Instruments Three Months Ended March 28, March 30, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 1,101 $ 1,322 (17) % Operating Income Margin 15.5 % 21.3 % -5.8 pt Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment decreased $221 million to $1.10 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Sales decreased $207 million (-16%) due to lower revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $14 million. The decrease in revenue at existing businesses was primarily the result of reduced demand from industrial customers in China following business slowing and closures due to COVID-19 and strong comparative results in the first quarter of 2019. Operating income margin was 15.5% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 21.3% in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by productivity improvements.

Sales increased $73 million (8%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The divestiture of Anatomical Pathology business resulted in a decrease in sales of $63 million. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $9 million. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was due to higher demand in part driven by products addressing treatment of COVID-19, with particular strength in sales of products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel business, and to a lesser extent, clinical diagnostics and transplant diagnostic products. Operating income margin was 24.7% in the first quarter of 2020 and 25.3% in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to sales mix, strategic growth investments and dilution from the 2019 divestiture, offset in part by profit on higher sales and productivity improvements. 30 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services Three Months Ended March 28, March 30, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change Revenues $ 2,730 $ 2,513 9 % Operating Income Margin 10.8 % 11.3 % -0.5 pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $217 million to $2.73 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Sales increased $150 million (6%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $92 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $25 million. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for service offerings of the segment's pharma services business and to a lesser extent, products sold through its research and safety market channel business. Operating income margin was 10.8% in the first quarter of 2020 and 11.3% in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to sales mix and strategic growth investments, offset in part by profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements. Other Income, Net The company reported other income, net, of $12 million and $19 million in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes The company's effective tax rate was 4.8% for the first quarter of 2020. The company expects its effective tax rate for all of 2020 will be between 7% and 9% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total $450 to $500 million in 2020. In the first quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $2 million provision for income taxes, net of a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements. In addition, the company recorded a net tax benefit of $27 million in the first quarter of 2019, to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform based on final regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in January 2019. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “ Recent Accounting Pronouncements ” in Note 1. Contingent Liabilities The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the headings “ Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters ” and “ Intellectual Property Matters ” in Note 8 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows 31 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $7.24 billion at March 28, 2020, compared with $5.70 billion at December 31, 2019. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $2.98 billion at March 28, 2020 and $2.40 billion at December 31, 2019. First Three Months of 2020 Cash provided by operating activities was $356 million during the first three months of 2020. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $218 million and $141 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $443 million primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation and customer billings. Cash payments for income taxes decreased to $100 million during the first three months of 2020, compared with $221 million in the first three months of 2019. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $32 million during the first three months of 2020. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $15 million during the first three months of 2020. During the first three months of 2020, the company’s investing activities used $260 million of cash, principally for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities provided $619 million of cash during the first three months of 2020. Issuance of senior notes provided cash of $2.19 billion. A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $61 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock and the payment of $76 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $48 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On November 8, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. At May 1, 2020, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. As discussed in Note 13, early in the second quarter of 2020, the company issued new senior notes for net proceeds of $1.3 billion. The company's commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially between December 31, 2019 and March 28, 2020 except for the agreement to acquire QIAGEN, discussed in Note 2. The company expects that for all of 2020, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $900 million and $1.0 billion. As of March 28, 2020, the company’s short-term debt totaled $738 million consisting principally of senior notes due in August 2020. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of March 28, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $71 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $2.98 billion as of March 28, 2020, debt proceeds of $1.3 billion in April 2020 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement and bridge loan agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses and funding of the QIAGEN acquisition for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. First Three Months of 2019 Cash provided by operating activities was $649 million during the first three months of 2019. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $29 million and $140 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $347 million primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation, customer billings and income tax refunds. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $221 million. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement 32 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) benefit plans totaling $32 million during the first three months of 2019. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $14 million during the first three months of 2019. During the first three months of 2019, the company’s investing activities used $181 million of cash including the purchase of $201 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $1.43 billion of cash during the first three months of 2019. A net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $687 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $750 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $68 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $81 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company's exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates has not changed materially from its exposure at year-end 2019. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended March 28, 2020, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting. 33 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings There are various lawsuits and claims against the company involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. See “Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements – Commitments and Contingencies.” Item 1A. Risk Factors Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 25 . We are subject to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) that has spread globally. In recent weeks, the continued spread has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of, and adversely impacts access to, capital and increases economic uncertainty. It is likely that the pandemic will cause an economic slowdown of potentially extended duration, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. COVID-19 is having, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations, supply chains and distribution systems, including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. Due to these impacts and measures, we have experienced, and will continue to experience, significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products. Many employers in the United States and Europe are requiring their employees to work from home or not go into their offices. If the pandemic continues and conditions worsen, we will experience a decline in sales activities and customer orders, and it remains uncertain what impact these declines will have on future sales and customer orders once conditions begin to improve. In addition to existing travel restrictions, countries may continue to close borders, impose prolonged quarantines, and further restrict travel, which would significantly impact our ability to support our sites and customers in those locations and the ability of our employees to get to their places of work to produce products, or significantly hamper our products from moving through the supply chain. As a result, given the rapid and evolving nature of the virus, COVID-19 will negatively affect our revenue growth, and it is uncertain how materially COVID-19 will affect our global operations generally if these impacts persist or worsen over an extended period of time. Any of these impacts would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and at this point, the extent of the impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain. We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive. Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue. It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including: • strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; 34 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) • allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; • developing new applications for our technologies; • expanding our service offerings; • continuing key customer initiatives; • combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively; • finding new markets for our products; and • continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings. We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business. Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, continue to be unstable, it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of • reducing demand for some of our products; • increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays; • increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; • increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services; • causing supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; and • creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds. Our growth would suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets would diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies. Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget. An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending. Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations. International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the “functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. As our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In the first three months of 2020, currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $65 million on revenues due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services. 35 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: • interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; • changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions; • changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers; • tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs recently adopted by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods; • the impact of public health epidemics/pandemics on the global economy, such as COVID-19 that has spread globally; • negative consequences from changes in tax laws; • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; • differing labor regulations; • differing protection of intellectual property; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and • geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war. For example, on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union, or EU and entered a transition period during which it will negotiate a trade deal with the EU. This withdrawal has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years. Our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU. In addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the United Kingdom. These possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, may adversely affect our operating results and our customers’ businesses. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, 36 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, we manufacture pharmaceuticals and many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products. Our pharma services offerings are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers, our business could suffer. Our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements. Our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our quality management strategy and systems, and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. A failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products. In each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether. In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such failure could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers for lost drug product, registered intermediates, registered starting materials, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, other customer claims, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. Production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high. If problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market, we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of which could be significant. We are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. We may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers. Additionally, products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Certain acquisitions, including the QIAGEN acquisition (Note 2), may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company. Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business. Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately 37 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) $25.61 billion and $1.25 billion, respectively, as of March 28, 2020. In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $12.29 billion as of March 28, 2020. We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. We assess the realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us. Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor. Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us. In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers. We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers. Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us. Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe. We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected. We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies. We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (the FDA), the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS), the European Medicines Agency (the EMA), in Europe, the EU member states and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale. The manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices and pharma services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including 38 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. We are the sole manufacturer of a number of pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers' ability to provide products to their customers. We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We have internal controls and compliance systems to protect the company against acts committed by employees, agents or businesses that we acquire that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy, but we cannot provide assurance that these controls and systems will prevent every such wrongful act. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies which we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements. Natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may disrupt our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, and could impact customer spending. We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk. An earthquake or other natural disaster such as a fire or hurricane or power shortages or outages could disrupt our operations or impair our critical systems. Any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control, such as strikes or other labor unrest, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing or warehouse facilities, or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict, or other events outside of our control, such as strikes or other labor unrest, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact customer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally, which could also adversely impact our operating results. For example, as described above, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that has spread globally has impacted and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flows. Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel. While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs. 39 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) Our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials or components could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. Some of our businesses purchase certain materials from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies. A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business. As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We also rely on our information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners) and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as interacting with suppliers, selling our products and services, fulfilling orders and billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers, tracking customer activity, fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise conducting business). Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, phishing, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results. Any of the cyber-attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above, if significant, could materially interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation imposes significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data. Several countries, such as China and Russia, have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. We have outstanding debt, and our debt will increase as a result of additional debt we expect to incur to finance the QIAGEN acquisition. Our existing and future indebtedness may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities and negatively impact our credit ratings. As of March 28, 2020, we had approximately $19.97 billion in outstanding indebtedness and in April 2020 we issued an additional $1.3 billion of senior notes. In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. We expect to incur additional indebtedness to fund a portion of the purchase price of the QIAGEN acquisition. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. 40 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.5:1.0. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0:1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as the impact of public health epidemics/pandemics, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments. Regulatory approvals necessary for our acquisition of QIAGEN may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the QIAGEN acquisition . Before the QIAGEN acquisition may be completed, we must obtain certain required regulatory approvals, waivers or consents. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the transaction. Such conditions could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the transaction, causing us to incur additional costs or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the transaction, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the transaction. Combining QIAGEN with us may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction may not be fully realized. The success of the QIAGEN acquisition, including the realization of anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine our and QIAGEN’s businesses. The integration may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or that the alignment of standards, controls, procedures and policies may adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, suppliers and employees or to fully achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction. The loss of key employees could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business in the markets in which QIAGEN now operates, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and the price of the notes. Other potential difficulties of combining our and QIAGEN’s businesses include unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information communications and other systems. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the QIAGEN acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of us and QIAGEN during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the QIAGEN acquisition on the combined company. 41 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1 . Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics, deliver medicines to market and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Interim Financial Statements The interim consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared by the company, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position at September 28, 2019 , the results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , and the cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 . Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2018 , has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain all information that is included in the annual financial statements and notes thereto of the company. The consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the 2018 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2018 describes the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Except for the accounting for leases, as noted below, there have been no material changes in the company’s significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 28, 2019 . Leases The company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. Prior to 2019, the company generally accounted for operating lease payments by charging them to expense as incurred. Beginning in 2019, operating leases that have commenced are included in other assets, other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Classification of operating lease liabilities as either current or noncurrent is based on the expected timing of payments due under the company’s obligations. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Because most of the company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the company estimates incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. Lease terms may include the effect of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As a lessee, the company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. See Note 9 additional information about the company's leases. Contract-related Balances Current contract assets and noncurrent contract assets are included within other current assets and other assets, respectively, in the accompanying balance sheet. Noncurrent contract liabilities are included within other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. Contract asset and liability balances are as follows: 8 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) September 28, December 31, (In millions) 2019 2018 Current Contract Assets, Net $ 609 $ 459 Noncurrent Contract Assets, Net 14 15 Current Contract Liabilities 943 809 Noncurrent Contract Liabilities 562 355 In the first nine months of 2019 , the company recognized revenue of $ 654 million that was included in the contract liabilities balance at December 31, 2018 . Contract assets increased in the first nine months of 2019 due to the timing of billing. Contract liabilities increased during the first nine months of 2019 primarily due to an advance payment from a customer and an acquisition. Warranty Obligations The liability for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. The changes in the carrying amount of standard product warranty obligations are as follows: Nine Months Ended September 28, September 29, (In millions) 2019 2018 Beginning Balance $ 92 $ 87 Provision charged to income 80 89 Usage ( 83 ) ( 80 ) Adjustments to previously provided warranties, net ( 1 ) ( 3 ) Currency translation ( 2 ) ( 2 ) Ending Balance $ 86 $ 91 Inventories The components of inventories are as follows: September 28, December 31, (In millions) 2019 2018 Raw Materials $ 943 $ 812 Work in Process 514 430 Finished Goods 1,851 1,763 Inventories $ 3,308 $ 3,005 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The company expects to adopt the guidance when it is effective in 2020 using a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The company expects to adopt the guidance when it is effective in 2020 with some items requiring a prospective method and others 9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) requiring a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to require a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis, such as accounts receivable, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. During 2018 and 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company expects to adopt the guidance when it is effective in 2020 using a modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities, initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments, with corresponding right-of-use assets. The new guidance also sets forth new disclosure requirements related to leases. During 2017 - 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The guidance became effective for the company in 2019. The company has elected to adopt the guidance using a modified retrospective method, by applying the transition approach as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Comparative periods have not been restated. As permitted upon transition, the company did not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts were or contained embedded leases, the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, initial direct costs for any leases, or whether land easements met the definition of a lease if they were not accounted for as leases under the prior guidance. Adoption of the new guidance impacted the company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: (In millions) December 31, 2018 as Reported Impact of Adopting New Lease Guidance January 1, 2019 As Adopted Other Assets $ 1,117 $ 641 $ 1,758 Other Accrued Expenses 1,470 132 1,602 Other Long-term Liabilities 2,515 505 3,020 Retained Earnings 18,696 4 18,700 Note 2 . Acquisitions and Dispositions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $ 1.67 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expands the segment's contract manufacturing capabilities. Revenues of Brammer Bio were approximately $ 140 million in 2018. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $ 938 million was allocated to goodwill, $ 405 million of which is tax deductible. In addition, in the nine months ended September 28, 2019 the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a Slovakia-based provider of mass spectrometry software used for identification of compounds, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 14 million . 10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) The components of the purchase price and net assets acquired for Brammer Bio are as follows: (In millions) Brammer Bio Purchase Price Cash paid $ 1,710 Cash acquired ( 36 ) $ 1,674 Net Assets Acquired Current assets $ 52 Property, plant and equipment 147 Definite-lived intangible assets: Customer relationships 744 Product technology 65 Tradenames 7 Goodwill 938 Other assets 49 Contract liabilities ( 109 ) Deferred tax liabilities ( 111 ) Other liabilities assumed ( 108 ) $ 1,674 T he weighted-average amortization periods for definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2019 are 14 years for customer relationships, 13 years for product technology and 2 years for tradenames. The weighted average amortization period for all definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2019 is 14 years . Disposition On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $ 1.13 billion , net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $ 482 million , included in restructuring and other (income) costs, net. Revenues in 2019, through the date of sale, and the full year 2018 of the business sold were approximately $ 115 million and $ 238 million , respectively, net of retained sales through the company's healthcare market and research and safety market channel businesses.

Each reportable segment earns revenues from consumables, instruments and services in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and other regions. See Note 4 for revenue by reportable segment and other geographic data. Remaining Performance Obligations The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations for all open customer contracts as of September 28, 2019 was $ 6.76 billion . The company will recognize revenue for these performance obligations as they are satisfied, approximately 70 % of which is expected to occur within the next twelve months . 12 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 4 . Business Segment and Geographical Information The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance based on operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines as well as from significant litigation-related matters; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 6 . Income Taxes The provision for income taxes in the accompanying statement of income differs from the provision calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before provision for income taxes due to the following: Nine Months Ended September 28, September 29, (In millions) 2019 2018 Statutory Federal Income Tax Rate 21 % 21 % Provision for Income Taxes at Statutory Rate $ 637 $ 473 Increases (Decreases) Resulting From: Foreign rate differential ( 172 ) ( 177 ) Foreign exchange loss on inter-company debt refinancing ( 62 ) — Income tax credits ( 242 ) ( 183 ) Global intangible low-taxed income 160 124 Foreign-derived intangible income ( 68 ) ( 34 ) Withholding taxes 30 — Singapore tax holiday ( 20 ) ( 29 ) Transition tax and other impacts of U.S. tax reform 8 117 Provision for (reversal of) tax reserves, net 16 ( 49 ) Excess tax benefits from stock options and restricted stock units ( 68 ) ( 59 ) Basis difference on disposal of business 72 — Other, net 47 27 Provision for income taxes $ 338 $ 210 The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. In 2019, the company recorded a $ 62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements as well as a tax provision of $ 191 million related to the gain on sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In addition, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $ 75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. During 2019, the company recorded a net tax provision of $ 1 million to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform based on final regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in 2019. The income tax provision consists of an incremental charge of $ 8 million offset by a $ 7 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits. The company has significant operations in Singapore and has received considerable tax incentives. The local taxing authority granted the company pioneer company status which provides an incentive encouraging companies to undertake activities that have the effect of promoting economic or technological development in Singapore. This incentive equates to a tax exemption on earnings associated with most of the company’s manufacturing activities in Singapore and continues through December 31, 2026 . In 2019 and 2018 , the impact of this tax holiday decreased the annual effective tax rates by 0.6 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points, respectively, and increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $ 0.05 and $ 0.07 , respectively. Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of September 28, 2019 , the company had $ 1.47 billion of unrecognized tax benefits substantially all of which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate. 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

See Note 12 for fair value information pertaining to the company’s long-term obligations. As discussed in Note 15 , early in the fourth quarter of 2019, the company issued new long-term senior notes and is using the proceeds to redeem the outstanding commercial paper, the 6.00% Senior Notes due 2020, the 1.5% Senior Notes due 2020, the 5.00% Senior Notes due 2021, the 4.50% Senior Notes due 2021, the 3.60% Senior Notes due 2021 and the 3.30% Senior Notes due 2022 included in the table above. Accordingly, all of this debt has been reported as long-term at September 28, 2019. 17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides for up to $ 2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The facility expires in July 2021 . The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of September 28, 2019 , no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $ 80 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of September 28, 2019 , outstanding borrowings under these programs were $ 683 million with a weighted average remaining period to maturity of 41 days . Senior Notes Interest on the floating rate senior notes is payable quarterly. Interest is payable annually on the other euro-denominated senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. In September 2019, the company redeemed its 4.70% Senior Notes due 2020 and its 3.15% Senior Notes due 2023. In connection with these redemptions, the company incurred $ 42 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt included in Other Expense, Net on the accompanying statement of income. In 2018, Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 included in the table above. This subsidiary has no independent function other than financing activities. The Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company and no other subsidiaries of the company have guaranteed the obligations. Interest Rate Swap Arrangements and related Cross-currency Interest Rate Swap Arrangements The company has entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks on several of its outstanding senior notes. The aggregate amounts of the swaps are equal to the principal amounts of the notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the interest payment dates of the notes. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate and receive a fixed rate. The variable interest rates reset monthly. The swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges of the notes. See Note 12 for additional information on the interest rate swap arrangements and related cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements. The following table summarizes the outstanding interest rate swap arrangements on the company's senior notes at September 28, 2019 : 18 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company has entered into $ 1.8 billion notional value of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which effectively convert a portion of the semi-annual payments related to the variable rate, U.S. dollar denominated, LIBOR-based interest rate swaps to payments on variable rate, euro denominated, EURIBOR-based cross-currency interest rate swaps. As discussed above and in Note 15 , early in the fourth quarter of 2019, the company redeemed its 4.50% Senior Notes due 2021 and its 3.60% Senior Notes due 2021 and settled the related interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps. Note 9 . Leases As a lessee, the company leases certain logistics, office, and manufacturing facilities, as well as vehicles, copiers, and other equipment. These operating leases generally have remaining lease terms between 1 month and 30 years , and some include options to extend (generally for 1 to 10 years ) or have options to terminate the arrangement within 1 year . The company’s finance leases are not material. The company has guaranteed the residual value of three leased operating facilities with lease terms ending in 2020, 2023 and 2024. The company has agreed with the lessor to comply with certain financial covenants consistent with its other debt arrangements (Note 8 ). The aggregate maximum guarantee under these three lease arrangements is $ 147 million . Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities for these lease arrangements are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 28, 2019 , but exclude any amounts for residual value guarantees. As a lessee, the consolidated statement of income includes pre-tax operating lease costs of $ 51 million and $ 149 million and pre-tax variable lease costs of $ 10 million and $ 31 million for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019 , respectively. Lease costs arising from finance leases, short-term leases, and sublease income are not material. Cash used in operating activities for payments of amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $ 149 million in the nine months ended September 28, 2019 . Operating lease ROU assets of $ 108 million were obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities in the nine months ended September 28, 2019 . The weighted-average remaining operating lease term was 6.3 years and the weighted average discount rate was 4.0 % as of September 28, 2019 . ROU assets of $ 645 million as of September 28, 2019 , are classified in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities of $ 158 million and $ 529 million as of September 28, 2019 , are classified in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet. As of September 28, 2019 , future payments of operating lease liabilities are as follows: 19 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. At September 28, 2019 , the company’s total environmental liability was approximately $ 63 million . While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 20 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Litigation and Related Contingencies There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company including matters involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters. A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred. The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed below or in the company's 2018 financial statements and notes included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters For product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters, the company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of possible loss when a range of possible loss can be estimated. The company records estimated amounts due from insurers related to certain product liabilities as an asset. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. Intellectual Property Matters On June 3, 2013, Unisone Strategic IP filed a complaint against Life Technologies in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California alleging patent infringement by Life Technologies’ supply chain management system software, which operates with product ""supply centers"" installed at customer sites. Plaintiff seeks damages for alleged willful infringement, attorneys’ fees, costs, and injunctive relief. On August 24, 2017, Unisone filed an appeal from a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) that found the challenged patent claims invalid. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the PTAB’s ruling finding the challenged claims in the Unisone patent invalid. Unisone had until March 11, 2019 to file an appeal with the United States Supreme Court. Unisone did not appeal that decision, and consequently the case before the United States District Court, which had been stayed pending the outcome of the PTAB decision, has resumed with respect to similar Unisone patent claims that were not included in the PTAB proceeding. 21 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements The company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during 2019 . The company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of insurance contracts, investments in money market funds, derivative contracts, mutual funds holding publicly traded securities and other investments in unit trusts held as assets to satisfy outstanding deferred compensation and retirement liabilities; and acquisition-related contingent consideration. The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access. Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data. The following tables present information about the company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018 : 22 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with such future payments. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs, of the contingent consideration. 23 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The majority of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity. 25 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2018 included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 8 herein for additional information on the company's risk management objectives and strategies. Cash Flow Hedge Arrangements In September 2019, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of debt offerings. Based on the company's conclusion that the debt offerings were probable, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the interest payments on € 1.80 billion plus $ 900 million aggregate principal amounts of the planned fixed-rate debt issues. The hedges were terminated in the third quarter of 2019, in connection with the early fourth quarter debt offerings (Note 15 ).

While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the company’s estimates change, and readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing the company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report. A number of important factors could cause the results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in Part II, Item 1A of this report on Form 10-Q. Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into four business segments (see Note 4 ): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. Recent Acquisitions and Divestiture The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent acquisitions and divestitures are described below. On October 25, 2018, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Becton Dickinson and Company's Advanced Bioprocessing business for $477 million in cash. This North America-based business adds complementary cell culture products that expand the segment's bioproduction offerings to help customers increase yield during production of biologic drugs. Revenues of the Advanced Bioprocessing business were $100 million in 2017. On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $1.7 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expands the segment's contract manufacturing capabilities. Revenues of Brammer Bio were approximately $140 million in 2018. On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $1.13 billion , net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $482 million , included in restructuring and other (income) costs, net. Revenues in 2019, through the date of sale, and the full year 2018 of the business sold were approximately $115 million and $238 million , respectively, net of retained sales through the company's healthcare market and research and safety market channel businesses. 30 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, September 29, September 28, September 29, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $ 1,701 27.1 % $ 1,504 25.4 % $ 5,018 26.8 % $ 4,572 25.6 % Analytical Instruments 1,358 21.7 % 1,333 22.5 % 4,004 21.4 % 3,901 21.9 % Specialty Diagnostics 879 14.0 % 894 15.1 % 2,779 14.9 % 2,773 15.5 % Laboratory Products and Services 2,619 41.8 % 2,470 41.7 % 7,765 41.5 % 7,433 41.6 % Eliminations (285 ) (4.6 )% (281 ) (4.7 )% (853 ) (4.6 )% (828 ) (4.6 )% $ 6,272 100 % $ 5,920 100 % $ 18,713 100 % $ 17,851 100 % Sales in the third quarter of 2019 were $6.27 billion , an increase of $352 million from 2018 . Sales increased $27 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $83 million in the third quarter of 2019 . Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $408 million ( 7% ) primarily due to increased demand in the quarter compared to the 2018 quarter. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew except for sales to industrial customers which were flat. Sales to customers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry remained particularly strong. Sales growth was strong in Europe, Asia and North America. In the third quarter of 2019 , total company operating income and operating income margin were $946 million and 15.1% , respectively, compared with $912 million and 15.4% , respectively, in 2018 . The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments, reversal of a litigation accrual in the 2018 period and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable sales mix. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. The company's effective tax rate was 7.6% for the third quarter of 2019. The company expects its effective tax rate for all of 2019 will be between 8% and 11% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total $725 to $775 million in 2019. The company's effective tax rate was 12.5% for the third quarter of 2018 including a net tax provision of $47 million to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform. Net income increased to $760 million in the third quarter of 2019 from $709 million in the third quarter of 2018 , primarily due to the increase in operating income and decrease in income tax provision in the 2019 period (both discussed above) offset in part by $42 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt in the third quarter of 2019. During the first nine months of 2019 , the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $3.06 billion compared with $2.74 billion for 2018 . The increase primarily resulted from lower investment in working capital in 2019 as well as higher income before amortization and depreciation. As of September 28, 2019 , the company’s short-term debt totaled $661 million consisting principally of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of September 28, 2019 , no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $80 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company completed a refinancing of $5.6 billion of debt early in the fourth quarter as discussed in Note 15 . 31 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $1.27 billion as of September 28, 2019 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and pension costs. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Form 10-K for 2018 , describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. While there have been no significant changes in the company's critical accounting policies during the first nine months of 2019 , as described in Note 1, the company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases under guidance that became effective January 1, 2019.

Sales in the third quarter of 2019 were $6.27 billion , an increase of $352 million from the third quarter of 2018 . Sales increased $27 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $83 million in 2019 . Aside from the effects of acquisitions/divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $408 million ( 7% ) primarily due to increased demand in the quarter compared to the 2018 quarter. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew except for sales to industrial customers which were flat. Sales to customers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry remained particularly strong. Sales growth was strong in Europe, Asia and North America. In the third quarter of 2019 , total company operating income and operating income margin were $946 million and 15.1% , respectively, compared with $912 million and 15.4% , respectively, in 2018 . The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments, reversal of a litigation accrual in the 2018 period and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable sales mix. In the third quarter of 2019 , the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $43 million , including $19 million of net charges associated with sales of businesses in prior periods, including post-closing adjustments. The company recorded 32 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) $5 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company also recorded $7 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally transaction and integration-related costs for recent acquisitions. In addition, the company recorded $12 million of cash restructuring charges, primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe. See Note 14 for restructuring charges expected in future periods. In the third quarter of 2018 , the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $32 million , including $4 million of net credits to selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily income from favorable results of product liability litigation, offset in part by third-party transaction/integration costs related to recent and pending acquisitions. The company recorded $24 million of cash restructuring costs, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe. The company also recorded $51 million of other income, net, principally for the favorable resolution of a litigation matter. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 4 ). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.

Sales increased $194 million ( 13% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $24 million due to an acquisition. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $21 million . The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment's principal businesses with particular strength in sales of bioproduction and biosciences products. Operating income margin was 34.5% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 32.9% in the third quarter of 2018 . The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales, offset in part by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable sales mix.

Sales increased $44 million ( 3% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $19 million . The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for chromatography and mass spectrometry products. Operating income margin was 23.0% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 22.0% in the third quarter of 2018 . The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by unfavorable sales mix and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments.

The divestiture of Anatomical Pathology business resulted in a decrease in sales of $63 million . The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $11 million . These decreases were offset in part by $59 million ( 7% ) of higher revenues at existing businesses. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was due to higher demand in each of the 34 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) segment's principal businesses with particular strength in sales of products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel business as well as immunodiagnostic products. Operating income margin was 25.3% in the third quarter of 2019 and 25.0% in the third quarter of 2018 . The increase was primarily due to profit on higher sales and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix. Laboratory Products and Services Three Months Ended September 28, September 29, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Revenues $ 2,619 $ 2,470 6 % Operating Income Margin 11.6 % 12.1 % -0.5 pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $149 million to $2.62 billion in the third quarter of 2019 . Sales increased $150 million ( 6% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $68 million due to an acquisition. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $34 million. Revenues decreased $35 million due primarily to a change in the method of reporting certain intersegment sales with no impact to consolidated results. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products sold through its research and safety market channel business and service offerings of the segment's pharma services business. Operating income margin was 11.6% in the third quarter of 2019 and 12.1% in the third quarter of 2018 . The decrease was primarily due to strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable sales mix offset in part by profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $124 million and $102 million in the third quarter of 2019 and 2018 , respectively (Note 5 ). In the third quarter of 2019 , the company recorded $42 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt). An increase in interest income of $11 million in 2019 was offset in part by an increase in interest expense of $2 million . The company expects to incur an additional $142 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2019 (see Note 15 ). Provision for Income Taxes The company's effective tax rate was 7.6% for the third quarter of 2019. The company expects its effective tax rate for all of 2019 will be between 8% and 11% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total $725 to $775 million in 2019. The company's effective tax rate was 12.5% for the third quarter of 2018 including a net tax provision of $47 million to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. 35 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales in the first nine months of 2019 were $18.71 billion , an increase of $862 million from the first nine months of 2018 . Sales increased $112 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $395 million in 2019 . Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $1.15 billion ( 6% ) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew with particular strength in sales to customers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry. Sales growth was strong in each of the company's primary geographic areas, particularly Asia. In the first nine months of 2019 , total company operating income and operating income margin were $3.36 billion and 18.0% , respectively, compared with $2.64 billion and 14.8% , respectively, in the first nine months of 2018 . The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales, the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments, unfavorable sales mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. In the first nine months of 2019 , the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $372 million , including $482 million of net gains on the sale of businesses, principally the Anatomical Pathology business (see Note 2). The company also recorded $16 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, and $54 million of net charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally transaction and integration-related costs related to acquisitions and a divestiture. In addition, the company recorded $33 million of cash restructuring charges, net, primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe (see Note 14 ). In the first nine months of 2018 , the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $49 million , including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company recorded $7 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs associated with recent and pending acquisitions, offset in part by income from the favorable results of product liability litigation. In addition, the company recorded $75 million of cash restructuring costs in its continuing effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company also recorded $40 million of other income, net, principally for resolution of a litigation matter. 36 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The increase in revenue at 38 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment's principal businesses with particular strength in service offerings of its pharma services business and products sold through its research and safety market channel business. Operating income margin was 12.0% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 12.3% in the first nine months of 2018 . The decrease was primarily due to strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and profit on higher sales. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $330 million and $385 million in the first nine months of 2019 and 2018 , respectively (Note 5 ). An increase in interest income of $87 million was offset in part by an increase in interest expense of $39 million . In 2019 , the company recorded $42 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt. The company expects to incur an additional $142 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2019 (see Note 15 ). Provision for Income Taxes The company recorded a $338 million provision for income taxes in the first nine months of 2019 including $191 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In addition, in 2019, the company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements and implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company recorded a $210 million provision for income taxes in the first nine months of 2018 . In 2018, the company recorded a net tax provision of $68 million to adjust the estimated initial impacts of U.S. tax reform recorded in 2017, consisting of an incremental provision of $117 million offset in part by a $49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. These adjustments were required based on new U.S. Treasury guidance and further analysis of available tax accounting methods and elections, legislative updates, regulations, earnings and profit computations and foreign taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" in Note 1 . Contingent Liabilities The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the headings ""Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters,"" ""Intellectual Property Matters"" and ""Commercial Matters"" in Note 10 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $4.67 billion at September 28, 2019 , compared with $4.48 billion at December 31, 2018 . Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $1.27 billion at September 28, 2019 and $2.10 billion at December 31, 2018 . First Nine Months of 2019 Cash provided by operating activities was $3.06 billion during the first nine months of 2019 . Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $321 million and $449 million , respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $186 million primarily due to the timing of customer billings. Other liabilities increased by $172 million primarily due to advance payments from customers. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $589 million during the first nine months of 2019 , compared with $449 million in the first nine months of 2018 . The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $40 million during the first nine months of 2019 . Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $45 million during the first nine months of 2019 . During the first nine months of 2019 , the company’s investing activities used $1.15 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $1.69 billion . Proceeds from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business provided $1.13 billion . The company's investing 39 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) activities also included the purchase of $637 million of property, plant and equipment. On September 30, 2019, the company acquired an active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing site in Cork, Ireland for approximately €90 million in cash. The company’s financing activities used $2.60 billion of cash during the first nine months of 2019 . Repayment of senior notes used cash of $1.70 billion . A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $3 million . The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $750 million of the company's common stock and the payment of $221 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $115 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On September 7, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock. Early in the fourth quarter of 2019, the company repurchased $750 million of the company's common stock. At November 1, 2019 , authorization remained for $500 million of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. As discussed in Note 15 , early in the fourth quarter of 2019, the company issued new senior notes for net proceeds of $5.6 billion and is using those proceeds to redeem existing debt. The company's commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially between December 31, 2018 and September 28, 2019 . The company expects that for all of 2019 , expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will approximate $925 and $975 million . As of September 28, 2019 , the company’s short-term debt totaled $661 million consisting principally of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of September 28, 2019 , no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $80 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $1.27 billion as of September 28, 2019 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. First Nine Months of 2018 Cash provided by operating activities was $2.74 billion during the first nine months of 2018 . Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $64 million and $333 million , respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $185 million primarily due to the timing of customer billings and income tax refunds. Other liabilities decreased by $199 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and, to a lesser extent, incentive compensation. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $449 million . The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $78 million during the first nine months of 2018 . Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $62 million during the first nine months of 2018 . During the first nine months of 2018 , the company’s investing activities used $532 million of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $59 million . The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $474 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $2.22 billion of cash during the first nine months of 2018 . Repayment of senior notes used cash of $2.05 billion . New long-term borrowings provided cash of $690 million . A net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $464 million . The company’s financing activities also included the payment of $198 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $97 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company's exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates has not changed materially from its exposure at year-end 2018 . 40 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2019 , that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings There are various lawsuits and claims against the company involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. See ""Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements – Commitments and Contingencies."" Item 1A. Risk Factors Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 30 . We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive. Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue. It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including: • strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; • allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; • developing new applications for our technologies; • expanding our service offerings; • continuing key customer initiatives; 41 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) • combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively; • finding new markets for our products; and • continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings. We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business. Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, are unstable, it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of • reducing demand for some of our products; • increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays; • increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; • increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services; • causing supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; and • creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds. Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies. Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget. An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending. Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations. International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the ""functional currency""). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. As our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In the first nine months of 2019 , currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $395 million on revenues due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: • interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; • changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions; • changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers; • tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs recently adopted by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods; • negative consequences from changes in tax laws; 42 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; • differing labor regulations; • differing protection of intellectual property; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and • geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war. Significant developments stemming from the U.S. administration or the U.K.’s referendum on membership in the EU could have an adverse effect on us. The U.S. administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements and is imposing significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the United States. The administration has also indicated an intention to request Congress to make significant changes, replacement or elimination of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and government negotiation/regulation of drug prices paid by government programs. Changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the health care system and drug prices, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business. Additionally, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the European Union, or EU. This referendum has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years. Our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the United Kingdom’s referendum. In addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the United Kingdom. These possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the United Kingdom’s actual or threatened withdrawal from the EU, may adversely affect our operating results and our customers’ businesses. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in 43 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products. Our pharma services offerings are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers, our business could suffer. Our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements. Our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our quality management strategy and systems, and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. A failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products. In each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether. In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such failure could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers for lost drug product, registered intermediates, registered starting materials, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, other customer claims, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. Production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high. If problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market, we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of which could be significant. We are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. We may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers. Additionally, products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company. Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business. Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $25.62 billion and $1.25 billion , respectively, as of September 28, 2019 . In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $13.06 billion as of September 28, 2019 . We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. We assess the realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. 44 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us. Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor. Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us. In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers. We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers. Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us. Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe. We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected. We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies. We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (the FDA), the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS), the European Medicines Agency (the EMA), in Europe, the EU member states and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale. The manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices and pharma services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. We are the sole manufacturer of a number of pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers' ability to provide products to their customers. We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be 45 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) classified as hazardous, and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad such as anti-corruption, anti-competition and privacy and data protection laws. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites. We rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products, pending sale. Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, hurricanes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business. We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk. Although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices. If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow. Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel. While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs. A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business. As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We also rely on our information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners) and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as interacting with suppliers, selling our products and services, fulfilling orders and billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers, tracking customer activity, fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise conducting business). Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, phishing, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results. Any of the cyber-attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above, if significant, could materially interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. European laws require us 46 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe, and the recently-enacted EU General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in May 2018, imposes significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data. Several countries, such as China and Russia, have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. Our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities. As of September 28, 2019 , we had approximately $17.05 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities There was no share repurchase activity for the company's third quarter of 2019 . On September 7, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock. At September 28, 2019 , $1.25 billion was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under this authorization. Early in the fourth quarter of 2019, the company repurchased $750 million of the company's common stock, leaving $500 million remaining under this authorization. Item 6.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1 . Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics, deliver medicines to market and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Interim Financial Statements The interim consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared by the company, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position at June 29, 2019 , the results of operations for the three- and six-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 , and the cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 . Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2018 , has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain all information that is included in the annual financial statements and notes thereto of the company. The consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the 2018 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2018 describes the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Except for the accounting for leases, as noted below, there have been no material changes in the company’s significant accounting policies during the six months ended June 29, 2019 . Leases The company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. Prior to 2019, the company generally accounted for operating lease payments by charging them to expense as incurred. Beginning in 2019, operating leases that have commenced are included in other assets, other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Classification of operating lease liabilities as either current or noncurrent is based on the expected timing of payments due under the company’s obligations. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Because most of the company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the company estimates incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. Lease terms may include the effect of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As a lessee, the company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. See Note 9 additional information about the company's leases. Contract-related Balances Current contract assets and noncurrent contract assets are included within other current assets and other assets, respectively, in the accompanying balance sheet. Noncurrent contract liabilities are included within other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. Contract asset and liability balances are as follows: 8 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) June 29, December 31, (In millions) 2019 2018 Current Contract Assets, Net $ 646 $ 459 Noncurrent Contract Assets, Net 13 15 Current Contract Liabilities 1,062 809 Noncurrent Contract Liabilities 532 355 In the first six months of 2019 , the company recognized revenue of $ 532 million that was included in the contract liabilities balance at December 31, 2018 . Contract assets increased in the first six months of 2019 due to the timing of billing. Contract liabilities increased during the first six months of 2019 primarily due to an advance payment from a customer and an acquisition. Warranty Obligations The liability for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. The changes in the carrying amount of standard product warranty obligations are as follows: Six Months Ended June 29, June 30, (In millions) 2019 2018 Beginning Balance $ 92 $ 87 Provision charged to income 53 58 Usage ( 55 ) ( 53 ) Adjustments to previously provided warranties, net ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Currency translation — ( 2 ) Ending Balance $ 89 $ 88 Inventories The components of inventories are as follows: June 29, December 31, (In millions) 2019 2018 Raw Materials $ 923 $ 812 Work in Process 495 430 Finished Goods 1,791 1,763 Inventories $ 3,209 $ 3,005 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The company expects to adopt the guidance when it is effective in 2020 using a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The company expects to adopt the guidance when it is effective in 2020 with some items requiring a prospective method and others 9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) requiring a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to require a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis, such as accounts receivable, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. During 2018 and 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company expects to adopt the guidance when it is effective in 2020 using a modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities, initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments, with corresponding right-of-use assets. The new guidance also sets forth new disclosure requirements related to leases. During 2017 - 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The guidance became effective for the company in 2019. The company has elected to adopt the guidance using a modified retrospective method, by applying the transition approach as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Comparative periods have not been restated. As permitted upon transition, the company did not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts were or contained embedded leases, the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, initial direct costs for any leases, or whether land easements met the definition of a lease if they were not accounted for as leases under the prior guidance. Adoption of the new guidance impacted the company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: (In millions) December 31, 2018 as Reported Impact of Adopting New Lease Guidance January 1, 2019 As Adopted Other Assets $ 1,117 $ 641 $ 1,758 Other Accrued Expenses 1,470 132 1,602 Other Long-term Liabilities 2,515 505 3,020 Retained Earnings 18,696 4 18,700 Note 2 . Acquisitions and Dispositions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $ 1.67 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expands the segment's contract manufacturing capabilities. Revenues of Brammer Bio were approximately $ 140 million in 2018. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $ 952 million was allocated to goodwill, $ 411 million of which is tax deductible. In addition, in 2019 the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, a Slovakia-based provider of mass spectrometry software used for identification of compounds, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 14 million . 10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) The components of the purchase price and net assets acquired for Brammer Bio are as follows: (In millions) Brammer Bio Purchase Price Cash paid $ 1,709 Cash acquired ( 36 ) $ 1,673 Net Assets Acquired Current assets $ 52 Property, plant and equipment 148 Definite-lived intangible assets: Customer relationships 744 Product technology 44 Tradenames 7 Goodwill 952 Other assets 49 Contract liabilities ( 110 ) Deferred tax liabilities ( 105 ) Other liabilities assumed ( 108 ) $ 1,673 T he weighted-average amortization periods for definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2019 are 14 years for customer relationships, 13 years for product technology and 2 years for tradenames. The weighted average amortization period for all definite-lived intangible assets acquired in 2019 is 14 years . The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for Brammer Bio was based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and is subject to adjustment upon finalization of the valuation of the acquired intangible assets and the related deferred taxes. Measurements of these items inherently require significant estimates and assumptions. The company expects to complete the valuation in the third quarter of 2019. In 2018, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Gatan, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Roper Technologies, Inc. In June 2019, as publicly announced, Roper Technologies and the company agreed to withdraw from the proposed transaction. Disposition On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $ 1.13 billion , net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $ 505 million , included in restructuring and other (income) costs, net. Revenues in 2019, through the date of sale, and the full year 2018 of the business sold were approximately $ 115 million and $ 238 million , respectively, net of retained sales through the company's healthcare market channel business. The assets and liabilities of the Anatomical Pathology business were as follows on December 31, 2018: (In millions) December 31, 2018 Current Assets $ 81 Long-term Assets 528 Current Liabilities 34 Long-term Liabilities 24 11 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Each reportable segment earns revenues from consumables, instruments and services in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and other regions. See Note 4 for revenue by reportable segment and other geographic data. Remaining Performance Obligations The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations for all open customer contracts as of June 29, 2019 was $ 7.07 billion . The company will recognize revenue for these performance obligations as they are satisfied, approximately 70 % of which is expected to occur within the next twelve months . 12 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 4 . Business Segment and Geographical Information The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance based on operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines as well as from significant litigation-related matters; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation.

Income Taxes The provision for income taxes in the accompanying statement of income differs from the provision calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before provision for income taxes due to the following: Six Months Ended June 29, June 30, (In millions) 2019 2018 Statutory Federal Income Tax Rate 21 % 21 % Provision for Income Taxes at Statutory Rate $ 464 $ 302 Increases (Decreases) Resulting From: Foreign rate differential ( 184 ) ( 127 ) Foreign exchange loss on inter-company debt refinancing ( 62 ) — Income tax credits ( 137 ) ( 119 ) Global intangible low-taxed income 134 81 Foreign-derived intangible income ( 24 ) ( 22 ) Withholding taxes 31 11 Singapore tax holiday ( 13 ) ( 19 ) Transition tax and other impacts of U.S. tax reform ( 20 ) 70 Provision for (reversal of) tax reserves, net 43 ( 49 ) Excess tax benefits from stock options and restricted stock units ( 50 ) ( 36 ) Basis difference on disposal of business 64 — Other, net 30 17 Provision for income taxes $ 276 $ 109 The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. In the first quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $ 62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements. In the second quarter of 2019, the company recorded a tax provision of $ 187 million related to the gain on sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In addition, in the second quarter of 2019, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $ 75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. During the first six months of 2019, the company recorded a net tax provision of $ 1 million to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform based on final regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in January and June 2019. The income tax provision consists of an incremental benefit of $ 20 million and a $ 7 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits in the first quarter of 2019 and a $ 28 million charge to increase an unrecognized tax benefit in the second quarter of 2019. The company has significant activities in Singapore and has received considerable tax incentives. The local taxing authority granted the company pioneer company status which provides an incentive encouraging companies to undertake activities that have the effect of promoting economic or technological development in Singapore. This incentive equates to a tax exemption on earnings associated with most of the company’s manufacturing activities in Singapore and continues through December 31, 2026 . In 2019 and 2018 , the impact of this tax holiday decreased the annual effective tax rates by 0.6 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points, respectively, and increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $ 0.03 and $ 0.05 , respectively. Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of June 29, 2019 , the company had $ 1.50 billion of unrecognized tax benefits substantially all of which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate. 15 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

See Note 12 for fair value information pertaining to the company’s long-term obligations. Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides for up to $ 2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The facility expires in July 2021 . The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of 17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) this type. The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of June 29, 2019 , no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $ 86 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of June 29, 2019 , outstanding borrowings under these programs were $ 737 million with a weighted average remaining period to maturity of 46 days and are classified as short-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet. Senior Notes Interest on the floating rate senior notes is payable quarterly. Interest is payable annually on the other euro-denominated senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. In 2018, Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 included in the table above. This subsidiary has no independent function other than financing activities. The Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company and no other subsidiaries of the company have guaranteed the obligations. Interest Rate Swap Arrangements and related Cross-currency Interest Rate Swap Arrangements The company has entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks on several of its outstanding senior notes. The aggregate amounts of the swaps are equal to the principal amounts of the notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the interest payment dates of the notes. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate and receive a fixed rate. The variable interest rates reset monthly. The swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges of the notes. See Note 12 for additional information on the interest rate swap arrangements and related cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements. The following table summarizes the outstanding interest rate swap arrangements on the company's senior notes at June 29, 2019 : Aggregate Notional Amount Pay Rate as of (Dollars in millions) Pay Rate June 29, 2019 Receive Rate 4.50% Senior Notes due 2021 (a) 1,000 1-month LIBOR + 3.4420% 5.8820 % 4.50 % 3.60% Senior Notes due 2021 1,100 1-month LIBOR + 2.5150% 4.9093 % 3.60 % 3.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (a) 1,000 1-month LIBOR + 1.7640% 4.1583 % 3.00 % (a) The payments on $ 1.8 billion notional value of these interest rate swaps are offset in part by cross-currency interest rate swaps which effectively reduced the pay rate as of June 29, 2019 from a weighted average of 4.86 % to a weighted average of 1.86 % . The company has entered into $ 1.8 billion notional value of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which effectively convert a portion of the semi-annual payments related to the variable rate, U.S. dollar denominated, LIBOR-based interest rate swaps to payments on variable rate, euro denominated, EURIBOR-based cross-currency interest rate swaps. 18 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 9 . Leases As a lessee, the company leases certain logistics, office, and manufacturing facilities, as well as vehicles, copiers, and other equipment. These operating leases generally have remaining lease terms between 1 month and 30 years , and some include options to extend (generally for 1 to 10 years ) or have options to terminate the arrangement within 1 year . The company’s finance leases are not material. The company has guaranteed the residual value of three leased operating facilities with initial lease terms ending in 2019, 2020 and 2023. The company has agreed with the lessor to comply with certain financial covenants consistent with its other debt arrangements (Note 8 ). The aggregate maximum guarantee under these three lease arrangements is $ 147 million . Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities for these lease arrangements are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of June 29, 2019 , but exclude any amounts for residual value guarantees. As a lessee, the consolidated statement of income includes pre-tax operating lease costs of $ 50 million and $ 98 million and pre-tax variable lease costs of $ 17 million and $ 26 million for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 , respectively. Lease costs arising from finance leases, short-term leases, and sublease income are not material. Cash used in operating activities for payments of amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $ 97 million in the six months ended June 29, 2019 . Operating lease ROU assets of $ 36 million were obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities in the six months ended June 29, 2019 . The weighted-average remaining operating lease term was 6.2 years and the weighted average discount rate was 4.0 % as of June 29, 2019 . ROU assets of $ 633 million as of June 29, 2019 , are classified in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities of $ 157 million and $ 517 million as of June 29, 2019 , are classified in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet. As of June 29, 2019 , future payments of operating lease liabilities are as follows: (In millions) Remainder of 2019 $ 96 2020 171 2021 128 2022 96 2023 68 2024 49 2025 and Thereafter 159 Total Lease Payments 767 Less: Imputed Interest 93 Total Operating Lease Liability $ 674 As a lessor, operating leases, sales-type leases and direct financing leases are not material. 19 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. At June 29, 2019 , the company’s total environmental liability was approximately $ 65 million . While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company including matters involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters. A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred. The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed below or in the company's 2018 financial statements and notes included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if 20 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters For product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters, the company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of possible loss when a range of possible loss can be estimated. The company records estimated amounts due from insurers related to certain product liabilities as an asset. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. Intellectual Property Matters On June 3, 2013, Unisone Strategic IP filed a complaint against Life Technologies in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California alleging patent infringement by Life Technologies’ supply chain management system software, which operates with product ""supply centers"" installed at customer sites. Plaintiff seeks damages for alleged willful infringement, attorneys’ fees, costs, and injunctive relief. On August 24, 2017, Unisone filed an appeal from a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) that found the challenged patent claims invalid. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the PTAB’s ruling finding the challenged claims in the Unisone patent invalid. Unisone had until March 11, 2019 to file an appeal with the United States Supreme Court. Unisone did not appeal that decision, and consequently the case before the United States District Court, which had been stayed pending the outcome of the PTAB decision, will resume with respect to similar Unisone patent claims that were not included in the PTAB proceeding.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 12 . Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements The company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during 2019 . The company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of insurance contracts, investments in money market funds, derivative contracts, mutual funds holding publicly traded securities and other investments in unit trusts held as assets to satisfy outstanding deferred compensation and retirement liabilities; and acquisition-related contingent consideration. The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access. Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data. The following tables present information about the company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018 : June 29, Quoted Prices in Active Markets Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs (In millions) 2019 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets Cash equivalents $ 1,117 $ 1,117 $ — $ — Investments in common stock, mutual funds and other similar instruments 20 20 — — Warrants 6 — 6 — Insurance contracts 123 — 123 — Derivative contracts 42 — 42 — Total Assets $ 1,308 $ 1,137 $ 171 $ — Liabilities Derivative contracts $ 66 $ — $ 66 $ — Contingent consideration 58 — — 58 Total Liabilities $ 124 $ — $ 66 $ 58 22 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with such future payments. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense.

A number of important factors could cause the results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in Part II, Item 1A of this report on Form 10-Q. Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into four business segments (see Note 4 ): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. Recent Acquisitions and Divestiture The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent acquisitions and divestitures are described below. On October 25, 2018, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Becton Dickinson and Company's Advanced Bioprocessing business for $477 million in cash. This North America-based business adds complementary cell culture products that expand the segment's bioproduction offerings to help customers increase yield during production of biologic drugs. Revenues of the Advanced Bioprocessing business were $100 million in 2017. On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $1.7 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expands the segment's contract manufacturing capabilities. Revenues of Brammer Bio were approximately $140 million in 2018. On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $1.13 billion , net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $505 million , included in restructuring and other (income) costs, net. Revenues in 2019, through the date of sale, and the full year 2018 of the business sold were approximately $115 million and $238 million , respectively, net of retained sales through the company's healthcare market channel business. 29 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $54 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $132 million in the second quarter of 2019 . Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $316 million ( 5% ) primarily due to increased demand in the quarter compared to the 2018 quarter. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew except for sales to academic and government customers which were flat. Sales to customers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry were particularly strong. Sales growth was strong in Asia and North America and moderate in Europe. In the second quarter of 2019 , total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.50 billion and 23.7% , respectively, compared with $0.94 billion and 15.4% , respectively, in 2018 . The increase in operating income was primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and unfavorable sales mix. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. The company's effective tax rate was 19.7% for the second quarter of 2019. The second quarter 2019 provision for income taxes includes $187 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business and a tax provision of $28 million to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform based on final regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in June 2019. In addition, in the second quarter of 2019, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company expects its effective tax rate for all of 2019 will be between 8% and 11% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total $725 to $775 million in 2019. The company's effective tax rate was 6.5% for the second quarter of 2018. Net income increased to $1.12 billion in the second quarter of 2019 from $752 million in the second quarter of 2018 , primarily due to the increase in operating income in the 2019 period (discussed above) offset in part by the increase in income taxes (discussed above). During the first six months of 2019 , the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $1.94 billion compared with $1.52 billion for 2018 . The increase primarily resulted from lower investment in working capital in 2019. As of June 29, 2019 , the company’s short-term debt totaled $2.38 billion including $1.63 billion of senior notes due within the next twelve months and $0.74 billion of commercial paper obligations. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of June 29, 2019 , no borrowings were outstanding under the 30 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $86 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $2.29 billion as of June 29, 2019 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and pension costs. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Form 10-K for 2018 , describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. While there have been no significant changes in the company's critical accounting policies during the first six months of 2019 , as described in Note 1, the company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases under guidance that became effective January 1, 2019.

Sales increased $54 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $132 million in 2019 . Aside from the effects of acquisitions/divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $316 million ( 5% ) primarily due to increased demand in the quarter compared to the 2018 quarter. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew except for sales to academic and government customers which were flat. Sales to customers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry were particularly strong. Sales growth was strong in Asia and North America and moderate in Europe. In the second quarter of 2019 , total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.50 billion and 23.7% , respectively, compared with $0.94 billion and 15.4% , respectively, in 2018 . The increase in operating income was primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and unfavorable sales mix. In the second quarter of 2019 , the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $443 million , including $505 million of gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business (see Note 2). The company recorded $5 million of charges to 31 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company also recorded $36 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally transaction costs related to acquisitions. In addition, the company recorded $11 million of cash restructuring charges, primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe. The company also recorded $6 million of charges for the impairment of acquired technology in development. See Note 14 for restructuring charges expected in future periods. In the second quarter of 2018 , the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $25 million , including $5 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company recorded $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily transaction/integration costs related to the acquisition of Patheon. The company recorded $16 million of cash restructuring costs, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe. The company also recorded $1 million of other charges, net, principally for hurricane response costs. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 4 ). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel business and for clinical diagnostic products and immunodiagnostic products. These increases were offset in part by lower sales in the Anatomical Pathology business, which the company sold at the end of the quarter. Operating income margin was 25.7% in the second quarter of 2019 and 27.2% in the second quarter of 2018 . The decrease was primarily due to weaker performance at the segment's former Anatomical Pathology business as well as strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix, offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and profit on higher sales. Laboratory Products and Services Three Months Ended June 29, June 30, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Revenues $ 2,633 $ 2,550 3 % Operating Income Margin 13.1 % 13.2 % -0.1 pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $83 million to $2.63 billion in the second quarter of 2019 .

The second quarter 2019 provision for income taxes includes $187 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business and a tax provision of $28 million to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform based on final regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in June 2019. In addition, in the second quarter of 2019, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company expects its effective tax rate for all of 2019 will be between 8% and 11% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total $725 to $775 million in 2019. The company's effective tax rate was 6.5% for the second quarter of 2018. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. 34 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) First Six Months of 2019 Compared With First Six Months of 2018 Six Months Ended (In millions) June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Total Change Currency Translation Acquisitions Operations Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $ 3,317 $ 3,068 $ 249 $ (87 ) $ 59 $ 277 Analytical Instruments 2,646 2,568 78 (66 ) — 144 Specialty Diagnostics 1,900 1,879 21 (47 ) — 68 Laboratory Products and Services 5,146 4,963 183 (120 ) 26 277 Eliminations (568 ) (547 ) (21 ) 8 — (29 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 12,441 $ 11,931 $ 510 $ (312 ) $ 85 $ 737 Sales in the first six months of 2019 were $12.44 billion , an increase of $510 million from the first six months of 2018 . Sales increased $85 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $312 million in 2019 . Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $737 million ( 6% ) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew with particular strength in sales to customers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry. Sales growth was strong in each of the company's primary geographic areas, particularly Asia. In the first six months of 2019 , total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.42 billion and 19.4% , respectively, compared with $1.72 billion and 14.4% , respectively, in the first six months of 2018 . The increase in operating income was primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business, profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and unfavorable sales mix. In the first six months of 2019 , the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $415 million , including $505 million of gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business (see Note 2). The company also recorded $11 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, and $47 million of net charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally transaction costs related to acquisitions and a divestiture. In addition, the company recorded $21 million of cash restructuring charges, net, primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe (see Note 14 ). In the first six months of 2018 , the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $81 million , including $8 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company recorded $11 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily for transaction and integration costs associated with recent acquisitions and changes in estimates of acquisition contingent consideration. In addition, the company recorded $51 million of cash restructuring costs in its continuing effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company also recorded $11 million of other costs, net, principally charges for litigation-related matters, and hurricane response costs. 35 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Operating income margin was 12.2% in the first six months of 2019 compared to 12.4% in the first six months of 2018 . The decrease was primarily due to strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and profit on higher sales. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $206 million and $283 million in the first six months of 2019 and 2018 , respectively (Note 5 ). An increase in interest income of $76 million was offset in part by an increase in interest expense of $37 million . Provision for Income Taxes The company recorded a $276 million provision for income taxes in the first six months of 2019 including $187 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In addition, in 2019, the company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements and implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company recorded a $109 million provision for income taxes in the first six months of 2018 . In the first quarter of 2018, the company recorded a net tax provision of $21 million to adjust the estimated initial impacts of U.S. tax reform recorded in 2017, consisting of an incremental provision of $70 million offset in part by a $49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. The adjustment was required based on new U.S. Treasury guidance released in the first quarter of 2018. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" in Note 1 . Contingent Liabilities The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the headings ""Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters,"" ""Intellectual Property Matters"" and ""Commercial Matters"" in Note 10 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $3.71 billion at June 29, 2019 , compared with $4.48 billion at December 31, 2018 . The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in short-term debt. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $2.29 billion at June 29, 2019 and $2.10 billion at December 31, 2018 . First Six Months of 2019 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.94 billion during the first six months of 2019 . Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in inventories used cash of $273 million primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $179 million primarily due to the timing of customer billings. Other liabilities increased by $319 million primarily due to advance payments from customers. Cash payments for income taxes decreased to $417 million during the first six months of 2019 , compared with $458 million in the first six months of 2018 . The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $34 million during the first six months of 2019 . Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $34 million during the first six months of 2019 . During the first six months of 2019 , the company’s investing activities used $950 million of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $1.69 billion . Proceeds from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business provided $1.13 billion . The company's investing activities also included the purchase of $421 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $735 million of cash during the first six months of 2019 . The company’s financing activities included the repurchase of $750 million of the company's common stock and the payment of $144 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $122 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $40 million . On September 7, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up 38 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) to $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock. At August 2, 2019 , authorization remained for $1.25 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. On July 24, 2019, the company repaid its €500 million Floating Rate Senior Note with cash on hand. The company's commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially between December 31, 2018 and June 29, 2019 except for an agreement to acquire a drug substance manufacturing site in Cork, Ireland for approximately €90 million in cash plus approximately €50 million of inventories at the site. The company expects that for all of 2019 , expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will approximate $925 and $975 million . As of June 29, 2019 , the company’s short-term debt totaled $2.38 billion including $1.63 billion of senior notes due within the next twelve months and $0.74 billion of commercial paper obligations. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of June 29, 2019 , no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $86 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $2.29 billion as of June 29, 2019 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. First Six Months of 2018 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.52 billion during the first six months of 2018 . Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $97 million and $195 million , respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $296 million primarily due to the timing of customer billings and income tax refunds. Other liabilities decreased by $359 million primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $458 million . The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $43 million during the first six months of 2018 . Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $46 million during the first six months of 2018 . During the first six months of 2018 , the company’s investing activities used $364 million of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $59 million . The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $301 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $1.35 billion of cash during the first six months of 2018 . Repayment of senior notes used cash of $1.35 billion . A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $106 million . The company’s financing activities also included the payment of $129 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $78 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company's exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates has not changed materially from its exposure at year-end 2018 . 39 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2019 , that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings There are various lawsuits and claims against the company involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. See ""Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements – Commitments and Contingencies."" Item 1A. Risk Factors Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 29 . We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive. Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue. It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including: • strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; • allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; • developing new applications for our technologies; • expanding our service offerings; • continuing key customer initiatives; • combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively; 40 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) • finding new markets for our products; and • continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings. We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business. Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, are unstable, it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of • reducing demand for some of our products; • increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays; • increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; • increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services; • causing supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; and • creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds. Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies. Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget. An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending. Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations. International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the ""functional currency""). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. As our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In the first six months of 2019 , currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $312 million on revenues due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: • interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; • changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions; • changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers; • tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs recently adopted by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods; • negative consequences from changes in tax laws; • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; 41 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) • differing labor regulations; • differing protection of intellectual property; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and • geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war. Significant developments stemming from the U.S. administration or the U.K.’s referendum on membership in the EU could have an adverse effect on us. The U.S. administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements and is imposing significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the United States. The administration has also indicated an intention to request Congress to make significant changes, replacement or elimination of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and government negotiation/regulation of drug prices paid by government programs. Changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the health care system and drug prices, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business. Additionally, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the European Union, or EU. This referendum has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years. Our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the United Kingdom’s referendum. In addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the United Kingdom. These possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the United Kingdom’s actual or threatened withdrawal from the EU, may adversely affect our operating results and our customers’ businesses. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products. 42 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) Our pharma services offerings are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers, our business could suffer. Our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements. Our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our quality management strategy and systems, and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. A failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products. In each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether. In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such failure could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers for lost drug product, registered intermediates, registered starting materials, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, other customer claims, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. Production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high. If problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market, we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of which could be significant. We are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. We may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers. Additionally, products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company. Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business. Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $25.76 billion and $1.25 billion , respectively, as of June 29, 2019 . In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $13.61 billion as of June 29, 2019 . We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. We assess the realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. 43 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us. Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor. Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us. In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers. We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers. Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us. Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe. We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected. We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies. We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (the FDA), the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS), the European Medicines Agency (the EMA), in Europe, the EU member states and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale. The manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices and pharma services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. We are the sole manufacturer of a number of pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers' ability to provide products to their customers. We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad such as anti-corruption, anti-competition and privacy and data protection laws. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or 44 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites. We rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products, pending sale. Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, hurricanes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business. We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk. Although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices. If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow. Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel. While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs. A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business. As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We also rely on our information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners) and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as interacting with suppliers, selling our products and services, fulfilling orders and billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers, tracking customer activity, fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise conducting business). Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, phishing, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results. Any of the cyber-attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above, if significant, could materially interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe, and the recently-enacted EU General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in May 2018, imposes significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and 45 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) process personal data. Several countries, such as China and Russia, have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. Our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities. As of June 29, 2019 , we had approximately $19.04 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities There was no share repurchase activity for the company's second quarter of 2019 . On September 7, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1 . Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics, deliver medicines to market and increase laboratory productivity. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. Interim Financial Statements The interim consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared by the company, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position at March 30, 2019 , the results of operations for the three-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 , and the cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 . Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2018 , has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain all information that is included in the annual financial statements and notes thereto of the company. The consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the 2018 financial statements and notes included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for 2018 describes the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Except for the accounting for leases, as noted below, there have been no material changes in the company’s significant accounting policies during the three months ended March 30, 2019 . Leases The company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. Prior to 2019, the company generally accounted for operating lease payments by charging them to expense as incurred. Beginning in 2019, operating leases that have commenced are included in other assets, other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Classification of operating lease liabilities as either current or noncurrent is based on the expected timing of payments due under the company’s obligations. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Because most of the company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the company estimates incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. Lease terms may include the effect of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As a lessee, the company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. See Note 9 additional information about the company's leases. Contract-related Balances Current contract assets and noncurrent contract assets are included within other current assets and other assets, respectively, in the accompanying balance sheet. Noncurrent contract liabilities are included within other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. Contract asset and liability balances are as follows: 8 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) March 30, December 31, (In millions) 2019 2018 Current Contract Assets, Net $ 545 $ 459 Noncurrent Contract Assets, Net 15 15 Current Contract Liabilities 967 809 Noncurrent Contract Liabilities 497 355 In the first three months of 2019 , the company recognized revenue of $336 million that was included in the contract liabilities balance at December 31, 2018 . Contract liabilities increased during the first quarter of 2019 primarily due to an advance payment from a customer. Warranty Obligations The liability for warranties is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. The changes in the carrying amount of standard product warranty obligations are as follows: Three Months Ended March 30, March 31, (In millions) 2019 2018 Beginning Balance $ 92 $ 87 Provision charged to income 27 31 Usage (28 ) (28 ) Adjustments to previously provided warranties, net (1 ) (1 ) Currency translation — 1 Ending Balance $ 90 $ 90 Inventories The components of inventories are as follows: March 30, December 31, (In millions) 2019 2018 Raw Materials $ 867 $ 812 Work in Process 472 430 Finished Goods 1,785 1,763 Inventories $ 3,124 $ 3,005 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In addition, significant estimates were made in estimating future cash flows to assess potential impairment of assets and in determining the fair value of acquired intangible assets (Note 2 ) and the ultimate loss from abandoning leases at facilities being exited (Note 14 ). Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The company expects to adopt the guidance when it is effective in 2020 using a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. 9 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The company expects to adopt the guidance when it is effective in 2020 with some items requiring a prospective method and others requiring a retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to require a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis, such as accounts receivable, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. During 2018, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The company expects to adopt the guidance when it is effective in 2020 using a modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities, initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments, with corresponding right-of-use assets. The new guidance also sets forth new disclosure requirements related to leases. During 2017 - 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The guidance became effective for the company in 2019. The company has elected to adopt the guidance using a modified retrospective method, by applying the transition approach as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Comparative periods have not been restated. As permitted upon transition, the company did not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts were or contained embedded leases, the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, initial direct costs for any leases, or whether land easements met the definition of a lease if they were not accounted for as leases under the prior guidance. Adoption of the new guidance impacted the company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: (In millions) December 31, 2018 as Reported Impact of Adopting New Lease Guidance January 1, 2019 As Adopted Other Assets $ 1,117 $ 641 $ 1,758 Other Accrued Expenses 1,470 132 1,602 Other Long-term Liabilities 2,515 505 3,020 Retained Earnings 18,696 4 18,700 Note 2 . Acquisitions and Dispositions The company’s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and the acquired companies’ results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $1.7 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. Revenues of Brammer Bio were approximately $140 million in 2018. The company expects to determine the preliminary purchase price allocation prior to the end of the second quarter of 2019. The company has entered into an agreement to acquire Gatan, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Roper Technologies, Inc., for approximately $925 million in cash. Gatan is a leading manufacturer of instrumentation and software used to enhance and extend the operation and performance of electron microscopes. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Upon successful completion of the regulatory approval process, Gatan will become part of the Analytical Instruments segment. Disposition On January 28, 2019, the company entered into an agreement to sell its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for approximately $1.14 billion . The business is part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. Revenues in the first 10 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) three months of 2019 and the full year 2018 of the business to be sold were approximately $85 million and $344 million , respectively. The sale is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019. The assets and liabilities of the Anatomical Pathology business were as follows on March 30, 2019: (In millions) March 30, 2019 Current Assets $ 85 Long-term Assets 540 Current Liabilities 32 Long-term Liabilities 33 Note 3 .

Each reportable segment earns revenues from consumables, instruments and services in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and other regions. See Note 4 for revenue by reportable segment and other geographic data. Remaining Performance Obligations The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations for all open customer contracts as of March 30, 2019 was $5.57 billion . The company will recognize revenue for these performance obligations as they are satisfied, approximately 85% of which is expected to occur within the next twelve months . 11 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 4 . Business Segment and Geographical Information The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance based on operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines as well as from significant litigation-related matters; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation.

Income Taxes The provision for income taxes in the accompanying statement of income differs from the provision calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before provision for income taxes due to the following: Three Months Ended March 30, March 31, (In millions) 2019 2018 Statutory Federal Income Tax Rate 21 % 21 % Provision for Income Taxes at Statutory Rate $ 172 $ 133 Increases (Decreases) Resulting From: Foreign rate differential (36 ) (51 ) Foreign exchange loss on inter-company debt refinancing (62 ) — Income tax credits (72 ) (41 ) Global intangible low-taxed income 70 32 Foreign-derived intangible income (12 ) (9 ) Singapore tax holiday (7 ) (8 ) Transition tax and other impacts of U.S. tax reform (20 ) 70 Reversal of tax reserves, net (5 ) (49 ) Excess tax benefits from stock options and restricted stock units (36 ) (25 ) Other, net 10 3 Provision for income taxes $ 2 $ 55 The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. In the first quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements. In addition, the company recorded a net tax benefit of $27 million in the first quarter of 2019, consisting of an incremental benefit of $20 million and a $7 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits, to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform based on final regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in January 2019. The company has significant activities in Singapore and has received considerable tax incentives. The local taxing authority granted the company pioneer company status which provides an incentive encouraging companies to undertake activities that have the effect of promoting economic or technological development in Singapore. This incentive equates to a tax exemption on earnings associated with most of the company’s manufacturing activities in Singapore and continues through December 31, 2026 . In 2019 and 2018 , the impact of this tax holiday decreased the annual effective tax rates by 0.9 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points, respectively, and increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 and $0.02 , respectively. Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of March 30, 2019 , the company had $1.43 billion of unrecognized tax benefits substantially all of which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate. 14 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

See Note 12 for fair value information pertaining to the company’s long-term obligations. Credit Facilities The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides for up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The facility expires in July 2021 . The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in Euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company’s option. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for facilities of 16 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) this type. The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. As of March 30, 2019 , no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $87 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Commercial Paper Programs The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes). Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment. Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies. Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. As of March 30, 2019 , there were no outstanding borrowings under these programs. Senior Notes Interest on the floating rate senior notes is payable quarterly. Interest is payable annually on the other euro-denominated senior notes and semi-annually on all other senior notes. Each of the notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium and accrued interest. The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements. In 2018, Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 included in the table above. This subsidiary has no independent function other than financing activities. The Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2020 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company and no other subsidiaries of the company have guaranteed the obligations. Interest Rate Swap Arrangements and related Cross-currency Interest Rate Swap Arrangements The company has entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks on several of its outstanding senior notes. The aggregate amounts of the swaps are equal to the principal amounts of the notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the interest payment dates of the notes. The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate and receive a fixed rate. The variable interest rates reset monthly. The swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges of the notes. See Note 12 for additional information on the interest rate swap arrangements and related cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements. The following table summarizes the outstanding interest rate swap arrangements on the company's senior notes at March 30, 2019 : Aggregate Notional Amount Pay Rate as of (Dollars in millions) Pay Rate March 30, 2019 Receive Rate 4.50% Senior Notes due 2021 (a) 1,000 1-month LIBOR + 3.4420% 5.9313 % 4.50 % 3.60% Senior Notes due 2021 1,100 1-month LIBOR + 2.5150% 4.9988 % 3.60 % 3.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (a) 1,000 1-month LIBOR + 1.7640% 4.2478 % 3.00 % (a) The payments on $1.8 billion notional value of these interest rate swaps are offset in part by cross-currency interest rate swaps which effectively reduced the pay rate as of March 30, 2019 from a weighted average of 4.93% to a weighted average of 1.86% . The company has entered into $1.8 billion notional value of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which effectively convert a portion of the semi-annual payments related to the variable rate, U.S. dollar denominated, LIBOR-based interest rate swaps to payments on variable rate, euro denominated, EURIBOR-based cross-currency interest rate swaps. 17 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 9 . Leases As a lessee, the company leases certain logistics, office, and manufacturing facilities, as well as vehicles, copiers, and other equipment. These operating leases generally have remaining lease terms between 1 month and 30 years , and some include options to extend (generally for 1 to 10 years ) or have options to terminate the arrangement within 1 year . The company’s finance leases are not material. The company has guaranteed the residual value of three leased operating facilities with initial lease terms ending in 2019, 2020 and 2023. The company has agreed with the lessor to comply with certain financial covenants consistent with its other debt arrangements (Note 8 ). The aggregate maximum guarantee under these three lease arrangements is $147 million . Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities for these lease arrangements are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 30, 2019 , but exclude any amounts for residual value guarantees. As a lessee, the consolidated statement of income includes pre-tax operating lease costs and variable lease costs of $48 million and $9 million for the three months ended March 30, 2019 . Lease costs arising from finance leases, short-term leases, and sublease income are not material. Cash used in operating activities for payments of amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $48 million in the three months ended March 30, 2019 . Operating lease ROU assets of $13 million were obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities in the three months ended March 30, 2019 . The weighted-average remaining operating lease term was 6.2 years and the weighted average discount rate was 4.0% as of March 30, 2019 . ROU assets of $600 million as of March 30, 2019 , are classified in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities of $156 million and $487 million as of March 30, 2019 , are classified in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet. As of March 30, 2019 , future payments of operating lease liabilities are as follows: (In millions) Remainder of 2019 $ 140 2020 158 2021 116 2022 84 2023 57 2024 39 2025 and Thereafter 134 Total Lease Payments 728 Less: Imputed Interest 85 Total Operating Lease Liability $ 643 As a lessor, operating leases, sales-type leases and direct financing leases are not material. 18 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters. The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company’s responsibility. Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company’s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented. The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters. The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. At March 30, 2019 , the company’s total environmental liability was approximately $66 million . While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Litigation and Related Contingencies There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company including matters involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters. A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred. The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated. The accrued liabilities are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed below or in the company's 2018 financial statements and notes included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters. It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company’s current accrual estimate, if 19 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters For product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters, the company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of possible loss when a range of possible loss can be estimated. The company records estimated amounts due from insurers related to certain product liabilities as an asset. Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially. Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred. The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims. Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis. Intellectual Property Matters On June 3, 2013, Unisone Strategic IP filed a complaint against Life Technologies in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California alleging patent infringement by Life Technologies’ supply chain management system software, which operates with product ""supply centers"" installed at customer sites. Plaintiff seeks damages for alleged willful infringement, attorneys’ fees, costs, and injunctive relief. On August 24, 2017, Unisone filed an appeal from a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) that found the challenged patent claims invalid. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the PTAB’s ruling finding the challenged claims in the Unisone patent invalid. Unisone had until March 11, 2019 to file an appeal with the United States Supreme Court. Unisone did not appeal that decision, and consequently the case before the United States District Court, which had been stayed pending the outcome of the PTAB decision, will resume with respect to similar Unisone patent claims that were not included in the PTAB proceeding.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 12 . Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements The company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during 2019 . The company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of insurance contracts, investments in money market funds, derivative contracts, mutual funds holding publicly traded securities and other investments in unit trusts held as assets to satisfy outstanding deferred compensation and retirement liabilities; and acquisition-related contingent consideration. The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access. Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data. The following tables present information about the company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 : March 30, Quoted Prices in Active Markets Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs (In millions) 2019 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets Cash equivalents $ 77 $ 77 $ — $ — Bank time deposits 2 2 — — Investments in common stock, mutual funds and other similar instruments 19 19 — — Warrants 6 — 6 — Insurance contracts 120 — 120 — Derivative contracts 75 — 75 — Total Assets $ 299 $ 98 $ 201 $ — Liabilities Derivative contracts $ 103 $ — $ 103 $ — Contingent consideration 37 — — 37 Total Liabilities $ 140 $ — $ 103 $ 37 21 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer. The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with such future payments. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs, of the contingent consideration.

The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The majority of the company’s euro-denominated senior notes and cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders’ equity.

In the first three months of 2019 , severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected less than 1% of the company’s workforce. As of May 3, 2019 , the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $65 million , primarily in 2019 and 2020, and expects to identify additional actions during 2019 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred.

Without limiting the foregoing, the words ""believes,"" ""anticipates,"" ""plans,"" ""expects,"" ""seeks,"" ""estimates,"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements are accompanied by such words. While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the company’s estimates change, and readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing the company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report. A number of important factors could cause the results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in Part II, Item 1A of this report on Form 10-Q. Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into four business segments (see Note 4 ): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. Recent Acquisitions The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent acquisitions and divestitures are described below. On October 25, 2018, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Becton Dickinson and Company's Advanced Bioprocessing business for $477 million in cash. This North America-based business adds complementary cell culture products that expand the segment's bioproduction offerings to help customers increase yield during production of biologic drugs. Revenues of the Advanced Bioprocessing business were $100 million in 2017. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity Three Months Ended March 30, March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $ 1,607 26.2 % $ 1,499 25.6 % Analytical Instruments 1,322 21.6 % 1,257 21.5 % Specialty Diagnostics 957 15.6 % 947 16.2 % Laboratory Products and Services 2,513 41.0 % 2,413 41.2 % Eliminations (274 ) (4.4 )% (263 ) (4.5 )% $ 6,125 100 % $ 5,853 100 % Sales in the first quarter of 2019 were $6.13 billion , an increase of $272 million from 2018 . Sales increased $31 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $180 million in the first quarter of 2019 . Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $421 million ( 7% ) primarily due to increased demand in the quarter compared to the 2018 quarter. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew. Sales growth was strong in each of the company's primary geographic areas, particularly Asia. 27 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) In the first quarter of 2019 , total company operating income and operating income margin were $920 million and 15.0% , respectively, compared with $786 million and 13.4% , respectively, in 2018 . The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and lower restructuring and other costs, net. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and unfavorable sales mix. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. The company recorded a $2 million provision for income taxes in the first quarter of 2019. The company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements. In addition, the company recorded a net tax benefit of $27 million in the first quarter of 2019, to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform based on final regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in January 2019. The company expects its effective tax rate for all of 2019 will be between 6% and 9% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total $725 to $775 million in 2019. The company recorded a $55 million provision for income taxes in the first quarter of 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, the company recorded a net tax provision of $21 million to adjust the estimated initial impacts of U.S. tax reform recorded in 2017, consisting of an incremental provision of $70 million offset in part by a $49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. The adjustment was required based on new U.S. Treasury guidance released in the first quarter of 2018. Net income increased to $815 million in the first quarter of 2019 from $579 million in the first quarter of 2018 , primarily due to the increase in operating income in the 2019 period (discussed above) and, to a lesser extent, lower income taxes (discussed above). During the first three months of 2019 , the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $649 million compared with $78 million for 2018 . The increase primarily resulted from higher income before amortization and depreciation in the 2019 period and lower investment in working capital in 2019. As of March 30, 2019 , the company’s short-term debt totaled $1.34 billion including $1.33 billion of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of March 30, 2019 , no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $87 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. On April 30, 2019, the company completed the acquisition of Brammer Bio for approximately $1.7 billion in cash (Note 2). The acquisition was funded with a combination of existing cash balances and short-term borrowings. The company also expects to fund the acquisition of Gatan with a combination of existing cash balances and short-term borrowings. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $1.11 billion as of March 30, 2019 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and pension costs. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic 28 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s Form 10-K for 2018 , describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. While there have been no significant changes in the company's critical accounting policies during the first three months of 2019 , as described in Note 1, the company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases under guidance that became effective January 1, 2019. Results of Operations First Quarter 2019 Compared With First Quarter 2018 Three Months Ended (In millions) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Total Change Currency Translation Acquisitions Operations Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $ 1,607 $ 1,499 $ 108 $ (48 ) $ 31 $ 125 Analytical Instruments 1,322 1,257 65 (38 ) — 103 Specialty Diagnostics 957 947 10 (27 ) — 37 Laboratory Products and Services 2,513 2,413 100 (72 ) — 172 Eliminations (274 ) (263 ) (11 ) 5 — (16 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 6,125 $ 5,853 $ 272 $ (180 ) $ 31 $ 421 Sales in the first quarter of 2019 were $6.13 billion , an increase of $272 million from the first quarter of 2018 . Sales increased $31 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $180 million in 2019 . Aside from the effects of acquisitions/divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $421 million ( 7% ) primarily due to increased demand in the quarter compared to the 2018 quarter. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew. Sales growth was strong in each of the company's primary geographic areas, particularly Asia. In the first quarter of 2019 , total company operating income and operating income margin were $920 million and 15.0% , respectively, compared with $786 million and 13.4% , respectively, in 2018 . The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and lower restructuring and other costs, net. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and unfavorable sales mix. In the first quarter of 2019 , the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $28 million , including $6 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company recorded $11 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for third-party transaction costs related to recently announced acquisitions and divestiture. The company also recorded $11 million of restructuring and other costs, net, primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe. See Note 14 for restructuring charges expected in future periods. In the first quarter of 2018 , the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $56 million , including $3 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company recorded $8 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily for third-party transaction/integration costs related to the acquisition of Patheon. The company recorded $35 million of cash restructuring costs, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe. The company also recorded $10 million of other charges, net, principally for litigation-related matters, and hurricane response costs. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition- 29 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 4 ). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.

Life Sciences Solutions Three Months Ended March 30, March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Revenues $ 1,607 $ 1,499 7 % Operating Income Margin 34.9 % 34.5 % 0.4 pt Sales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $108 million to $1.61 billion in the first quarter of 2019 . Sales increased $125 million ( 8% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $31 million due to an acquisition. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $48 million . The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment's principal businesses with particular strength in sales of biosciences and bioproduction products. 30 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Operating income margin was 34.9% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 34.5% in the first quarter of 2018 . The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales offset in part by strategic growth investments, unfavorable sales mix and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Analytical Instruments Three Months Ended March 30, March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Revenues $ 1,322 $ 1,257 5 % Operating Income Margin 21.3 % 19.6 % 1.7 pt Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $65 million to $1.32 billion in the first quarter of 2019 . Sales increased $103 million ( 8% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $38 million . The increase in revenue at existing businesses was due to increased demand for products sold by each of the segment's primary businesses. Operating income margin was 21.3% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 19.6% in the first quarter of 2018 . The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and favorable foreign currency exchange offset in part by strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix. Specialty Diagnostics Three Months Ended March 30, March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Revenues $ 957 $ 947 1 % Operating Income Margin 25.3 % 25.6 % -0.3 pt Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $10 million to $957 million in the first quarter of 2019 . Sales increased $37 million ( 4% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $27 million . The increase in revenue at existing businesses was due to higher demand in each of the segment's principal businesses with particular strength in sales of clinical diagnostic products and immunodiagnostic products. Operating income margin was 25.3% in the first quarter of 2019 and 25.6% in the first quarter of 2018 . The decrease was primarily due to strategic growth investments offset in part by profit on higher sales and favorable sales mix. Laboratory Products and Services Three Months Ended March 30, March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Revenues $ 2,513 $ 2,413 4 % Operating Income Margin 11.3 % 11.6 % -0.3 pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $100 million to $2.51 billion in the first quarter of 2019 . Sales increased $172 million ( 7% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $72 million . The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment's principal businesses with particular strength in service offerings of its pharma services business and products sold through its research and safety market channel business. 31 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Operating income margin was 11.3% in the first quarter of 2019 and 11.6% in the first quarter of 2018 . The decrease was primarily due to strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix offset in part by profit on higher sales and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $103 million and $152 million in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 , respectively (Note 5 ). An increase in interest income of $47 million in 2019 was offset in part by an increase in interest expense of $26 million . Provision for Income Taxes The company recorded a $2 million provision for income taxes in the first quarter of 2019. The company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements. In addition, the company recorded a net tax benefit of $27 million in the first quarter of 2019, to adjust the impacts of U.S. tax reform based on final regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury in January 2019. The company expects its effective tax rate for all of 2019 will be between 6% and 9% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total $725 to $775 million in 2019. The company recorded a $55 million provision for income taxes in the first quarter of 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, the company recorded a net tax provision of $21 million to adjust the estimated initial impacts of U.S. tax reform recorded in 2017, consisting of an incremental provision of $70 million offset in part by a $49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. The adjustment was required based on new U.S. Treasury guidance released in the first quarter of 2018. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" in Note 1 . Contingent Liabilities The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the headings ""Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters,"" ""Intellectual Property Matters"" and ""Commercial Matters"" in Note 10 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $4.04 billion at March 30, 2019 , compared with $4.48 billion at December 31, 2018 . Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $1.11 billion at March 30, 2019 and $2.10 billion at December 31, 2018 . First Three Months of 2019 Cash provided by operating activities was $649 million during the first three months of 2019 . Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $29 million and $140 million , respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $117 million primarily due to the timing of customer billings and income tax refunds. Other liabilities decreased by $230 million primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation. Cash payments for income taxes decreased to $221 million during the first three months of 2019 , compared with $331 million in the first three months of 2018 . The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $32 million during the first three months of 2019 . 32 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $14 million during the first three months of 2019 . During the first three months of 2019 , the company’s investing activities used $181 million of cash including the purchase of $201 million of property, plant and equipment. On April 30, 2019, the company completed the acquisition of Brammer Bio for approximately $1.7 billion in cash (Note 2). The acquisition was funded with a combination of existing cash balances and short-term borrowings. The company also expects to fund the acquisition of Gatan with a combination of existing cash balances and short-term borrowings. The company’s financing activities used $1.43 billion of cash during the first three months of 2019 . A net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $687 million . The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $750 million of the company's common stock and the payment of $68 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $81 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On September 7, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock. At May 3, 2019 , authorization remained for $1.25 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. The company's commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments did not change materially between December 31, 2018 and March 30, 2019 . The company expects that for all of 2019 , expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will approximate $925 and $975 million . As of March 30, 2019 , the company’s short-term debt totaled $1.34 billion including $1.33 billion of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of March 30, 2019 , no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $87 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $1.11 billion as of March 30, 2019 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. First Three Months of 2018 Cash provided by operating activities was $78 million during the first three months of 2018 . Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $71 million and $124 million , respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $241 million primarily due to the timing of income tax refunds and customer billings. Other liabilities decreased by $471 million primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $331 million . The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $24 million during the first three months of 2018 . Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $23 million during the first three months of 2018 . During the first three months of 2018 , the company’s investing activities used $179 million of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $57 million . The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $118 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $342 million of cash during the first three months of 2018 . Repayment of senior notes used cash of $453 million . A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $182 million . The company’s financing activities also included the payment of $60 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $39 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. 33 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company's exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates has not changed materially from its exposure at year-end 2018 . Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 , that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings There are various lawsuits and claims against the company involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues. See ""Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements – Commitments and Contingencies."" Item 1A. Risk Factors Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 27 . We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive. Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue. It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including: • strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; • allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; 34 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) • developing new applications for our technologies; • expanding our service offerings; • continuing key customer initiatives; • combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively; • finding new markets for our products; and • continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings. We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business. Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, are unstable, it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of • reducing demand for some of our products; • increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays; • increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; • increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services; • causing supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; and • creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds. Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies. Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget. An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending. Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations. International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the ""functional currency""). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. As our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In the first three months of 2019 , currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $180 million on revenues due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: • interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; • changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions; • changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers; 35 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) • tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs recently adopted by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods; • negative consequences from changes in tax laws; • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; • differing labor regulations; • differing protection of intellectual property; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and • geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war. Significant developments stemming from the U.S. administration or the U.K.’s referendum on membership in the EU could have an adverse effect on us. The U.S. administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements and is imposing significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the United States. The administration has also indicated an intention to request Congress to make significant changes, replacement or elimination of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and government negotiation/regulation of drug prices paid by government programs. Changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the health care system and drug prices, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business. Additionally, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the European Union, or EU. This referendum has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years. Our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the United Kingdom’s referendum. In addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the United Kingdom. These possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the United Kingdom’s actual or threatened withdrawal from the EU, may adversely affect our operating results and our customers’ businesses. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 36 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products. Our pharma services offerings are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers, our business could suffer. Our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements. Our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our quality management strategy and systems, and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. A failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products. In each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether. In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such failure could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers for lost drug product, registered intermediates, registered starting materials, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, other customer claims, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. Production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high. If problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market, we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of which could be significant. We are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. We may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers. Additionally, products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company. Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business. Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $25.24 billion and $1.26 billion , respectively, as of March 30, 2019 . In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $13.23 billion as of March 30, 2019 . We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. We assess the 37 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us. Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor. Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us. In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers. We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers. Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us. Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe. We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected. We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies. We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (the FDA), the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS), the European Medicines Agency (the EMA), in Europe, the EU member states and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale. The manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices and pharma services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. We are the sole manufacturer of a number of 38 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers' ability to provide products to their customers. We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad such as anti-corruption, anti-competition and privacy and data protection laws. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites. We rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products, pending sale. Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, hurricanes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business. We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk. Although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices. If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow. Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel. While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs. A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business. As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We also rely on our information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners) and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as interacting with suppliers, selling our products and services, fulfilling orders and billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers, tracking customer activity, fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise conducting business). Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, phishing, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results. Any of the cyber-attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above, if significant, could materially interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business 39 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Risk Factors (continued) consequences. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe, and the recently-enacted EU General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in May 2018, imposes significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data. Several countries, such as China and Russia, have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. Our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities. As of March 30, 2019 , we had approximately $18.15 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures. Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility. Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.5 :1.0. The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments. 40 THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 2.
