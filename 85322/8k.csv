The Company defines distributable earnings as net income adjusted for unrealized gains and losses related to certain mortgage backed securities (“MBS”) not retained by us as part of our loan origination business, realized gains and losses on sales of certain MBS, unrealized gains and losses related to residential mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”), unrealized current non-cash provision for credit losses and one-time non-recurring gains or losses, such as gains or losses on discontinued operations, bargain purchase gains, merger related expenses, or other one-time items. The Company believes that this non-U.S. GAAP financial information, in addition to the related U.S. GAAP measures, provides investors greater transparency into the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, including the determination of dividends. However, because Distributable Earnings is an incomplete measure of the Company's financial performance and involves differences from net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, it should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, the Company's net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of the Company's financial performance. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of Distributable Earnings may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies. In calculating Distributable Earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses on MBS acquired by the Company in the secondary market but is not adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses on MBS retained by Ready Capital as part of its loan origination businesses, where the Company transfers originated loans into an MBS securitization and the Company retains an interest in the securitization. In calculating Distributable Earnings, the Company does not adjust Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) to take into account unrealized gains and losses on MBS retained by us as part of the loan origination businesses because the unrealized gains and losses that are generated in the loan origination and securitization process are considered to be a fundamental part of this business and an indicator of the ongoing performance and credit quality of the Company’s historical loan originations. In calculating Distributable Earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude realized gains and losses on certain MBS securities considered to be non-distributable. Certain MBS positions are considered to be non-distributable due to a variety of reasons which may include collateral type, duration, and size. In addition, in calculating Distributable Earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude unrealized gains or losses on residential MSRs, held at fair value. The Company treats its commercial MSRs and residential MSRs as two separate classes based on the nature of the underlying mortgages and the treatment of these assets as two separate pools for risk management purposes. Servicing rights relating to the Company’s small business commercial business are accounted for under ASC 860, Transfer and Servicing , while the Company’s residential MSRs are accounted for under the fair value option under ASC 825, Financial Instruments . In calculating Distributable Earnings, the Company does not exclude realized gains or losses on either commercial MSRs or residential MSRs, held at fair value, as servicing income is a fundamental part of Ready Capital’s business and is an indicator of the ongoing performance. ​ To qualify as a REIT, the Company must distribute to its stockholders each calendar year at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (including certain items of non-cash income), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. There are certain items, including net income generated from the creation of MSRs, that are included in distributable earnings but are not included in the calculation of the current year’s taxable income. These differences may result in certain items that are recognized in the current period’s calculation of distributable earnings not being included in taxable income, and thus not subject to the REIT dividend distribution requirement until future years. The table below reconciles Net Income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Distributable Earnings. ​ ​ ​ (in thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net Income $ 47,179 Reconciling items: ​ ​ Unrealized gain on MSR ​ (2,563) Decrease in CECL reserve ​ (12,151) Non-cash compensation ​ 2,275 Merger transaction costs and other non-recurring expenses ​ 2,536 Loss on bargain purchase ​ 14,862 Total reconciling items $ 4,959 Income tax adjustments ​ 26 Distributable earnings $ 52,164 Less: Distributable earnings attributable to non-controlling interests ​ 1,566 Less: Income attributable to participating shares ​ 2,334 Distributable earnings attributable to common stockholders $ 48,264 Distributable earnings per common share - basic $ 0.28 Distributable earnings per common share - diluted $ 0.28 U.S. GAAP return on equity is based on U.S. GAAP net income, while distributable return on equity is based on distributable earnings, which adjusts U.S. GAAP net income for the items in the distributable earnings reconciliation above.

Q3 Dividend yield for the period is based on the 9/29/2023 closing share price of $10.11 APPENDIX Additional Financial Information 16 Balance Sheet by Quarter 17 Statement of Income by Quarter 18 Distributable Earnings Reconciliation by Quarter The Company believes that this non-U.S. GAAP financial information, in addition to the related U.S. GAAP measures, provides investors greater transparency into the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, including the determination of dividends. However, because Distributable Earnings is an incomplete measure of the Company's financial performance and involves differences from net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, it should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, the Company's net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of the Company's financial performance. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of Distributable Earnings may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies. We calculate Distributable earnings as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the following: i) any unrealized gains or losses on certain MBS not retained by us as part of our loan origination businesses ii) any realized gains or losses on sales of certain MBS iii) any unrealized gains or losses on Residential MSRs iv) any unrealized change in current expected credit loss reserve v) any unrealized gains or losses on de-designated cash flow hedges vi) any non-cash compensation expense related to stock-based incentive plan vii) one-time non-recurring gains or losses, such as gains or losses on discontinued operations, bargain purchase gains, or merger related expenses In calculating Distributable Earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses on MBS acquired by the Company in the secondary market but is not adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses on MBS retained by Ready Capital as part of its loan origination businesses, where the Company transfers originated loans into an MBS securitization and the Company retains an interest in the securitization. In calculating Distributable Earnings, the Company does not adjust Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) to take into account unrealized gains and losses on MBS retained by us as part of the loan origination businesses because the unrealized gains and losses that are generated in the loan origination and securitization process are considered to be a fundamental part of this business and an indicator of the ongoing performance and credit quality of the Company’s historical loan originations. In calculating Distributable Earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude realized gains and losses on certain MBS securities considered to be non-distributable. Certain MBS positions are considered to be non-distributable due to a variety of reasons which may include collateral type, duration, and size. In 2016, the Company liquidated the majority of its MBS portfolio from distributable earnings to fund recurring operating segments. In addition, in calculating Distributable Earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude unrealized gains or losses on residential MSRs, held at fair value. The Company treats its commercial MSRs and residential MSRs as two separate classes based on the nature of the underlying mortgages and the treatment of these assets as two separate pools for risk management purposes. Servicing rights relating to the Company’s small business commercial business are accounted for under ASC 860, Transfer and Servicing, while the Company’s residential MSRs are accounted for under the fair value option under ASC 825, Financial Instruments. In calculating Distributable Earnings, the Company does not exclude realized gains or losses on either commercial MSRs or residential MSRs, held at fair value, as servicing income is a fundamental part of Ready Capital’s business and is an indicator of the ongoing performance. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must distribute to its stockholders each calendar year at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (including certain items of non-cash income), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. There are certain items, including net income generated from the creation of MSRs, that are included in distributable earnings but are not included in the calculation of the current year’s taxable income. These differences may result in certain items that are recognized in the current period’s calculation of distributable earnings not being included in taxable income, and thus not subject to the REIT dividend distribution requirement until future years.-;-",0001527590,RC,"8-K:UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K ​ CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): November 7, 2023 READY CAPITAL CORPORATION (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) ​ ​ ​ ​ Maryland 001-35808 90-0729143 (State or other jurisdiction (Commission File Number) (IRS Employer of incorporation) ​ Identification No.) ​ 1251 Avenue of the Americas, 50 th Floor New York , NY 10020 (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) ​ Registrant's telephone number, including area code: ( 212 ) 257-4600 n/a (Former name or former address, if changed since last report.)

The Company defines distributable earnings as net income adjusted for unrealized gains and losses related to certain mortgage backed securities (“MBS”) not retained by us as part of our loan origination business, realized gains and losses on sales of certain MBS, unrealized gains and losses related to residential mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”), unrealized current non-cash provision for credit losses and one-time non-recurring gains or losses, such as gains or losses on discontinued operations, bargain purchase gains, merger related expenses, or other one-time items. The Company believes that this non-U.S. GAAP financial information, in addition to the related U.S. GAAP measures, provides investors greater transparency into the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, including the determination of dividends. However, because Distributable Earnings is an incomplete measure of the Company's financial performance and involves differences from net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, it should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, the Company's net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of the Company's financial performance. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of Distributable Earnings may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies. In calculating Distributable Earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses on MBS acquired by the Company in the secondary market but is not adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses on MBS retained by Ready Capital as part of its loan origination businesses, where the Company transfers originated loans into an MBS securitization and the Company retains an interest in the securitization. In calculating Distributable Earnings, the Company does not adjust Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) to take into account unrealized gains and losses on MBS retained by us as part of the loan origination businesses because the unrealized gains and losses that are generated in the loan origination and securitization process are considered to be a fundamental part of this business and an indicator of the ongoing performance and credit quality of the Company’s historical loan originations. In calculating Distributable Earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude realized gains and losses on certain MBS securities considered to be non-distributable. Certain MBS positions are considered to be non-distributable due to a variety of reasons which may include collateral type, duration, and size. In addition, in calculating Distributable Earnings, Net Income (in accordance with U.S. GAAP) is adjusted to exclude unrealized gains or losses on residential MSRs, held at fair value. The Company treats its commercial MSRs and residential MSRs as two separate classes based on the nature of the underlying mortgages and the treatment of these assets as two separate pools for risk management purposes. Servicing rights relating to the Company’s small business commercial business are accounted for under ASC 860, Transfer and Servicing , while the Company’s residential MSRs are accounted for under the fair value option under ASC 825, Financial Instruments . In calculating Distributable Earnings, the Company does not exclude realized gains or losses on either commercial MSRs or residential MSRs, held at fair value, as servicing income is a fundamental part of Ready Capital’s business and is an indicator of the ongoing performance. ​ To qualify as a REIT, the Company must distribute to its stockholders each calendar year at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (including certain items of non-cash income), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. There are certain items, including net income generated from the creation of MSRs, that are included in distributable earnings but are not included in the calculation of the current year’s taxable income. These differences may result in certain items that are recognized in the current period’s calculation of distributable earnings not being included in taxable income, and thus not subject to the REIT dividend distribution requirement until future years. The table below reconciles Net Income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Distributable Earnings. ​ ​ ​ (in thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net Income $ 47,179 Reconciling items: ​ ​ Unrealized gain on MSR ​ (2,563) Decrease in CECL reserve ​ (12,151) Non-cash compensation ​ 2,275 Merger transaction costs and other non-recurring expenses ​ 2,536 Loss on bargain purchase ​ 14,862 Total reconciling items $ 4,959 Income tax adjustments ​ 26 Distributable earnings $ 52,164 Less: Distributable earnings attributable to non-controlling interests ​ 1,566 Less: Income attributable to participating shares ​ 2,334 Distributable earnings attributable to common stockholders $ 48,264 Distributable earnings per common share - basic $ 0.28 Distributable earnings per common share - diluted $ 0.28 U.S. GAAP return on equity is based on U.S. GAAP net income, while distributable return on equity is based on distributable earnings, which adjusts U.S. GAAP net income for the items in the distributable earnings reconciliation above.

No fractional shares of Ready Capital Common Stock were issued in the Merger, and the value of any fractional interests to which a former holder of Broadmark Common Stock was otherwise entitled was paid in cash. Additionally, at the Effective Time, each award of performance restricted stock units (each a “Broadmark Performance RSU Award”) granted by Broadmark under its 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Broadmark Equity Plan”) was automatically cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a number of shares of Ready Capital Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Broadmark Common Stock subject to such Broadmark Performance RSU Award based on the achievement of the applicable performance metric measured as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Furthermore, as of the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units that was not a Broadmark Performance RSU Award granted pursuant to the Broadmark Equity Plan (each a “Broadmark RSU Award”) was assumed by Ready Capital and converted into an award of restricted stock units with respect to a number of shares of Ready Capital Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Broadmark Common Stock subject to such Broadmark RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Broadmark RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Announces Acquisition of Assets from i3 Electronics, Inc. Acquisition strengthens advanced technology PCB capabilities for emerging applications in the aerospace and defense end market and high end commercial customers. Santa Ana, CAJune 13, 2019TTM Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTMI), a leading global printed circuit board (PCB) and radio frequency (RF) components manufacturer, today announced that it has agreed to acquire certain manufacturing and intellectual property assets from i3 Electronics, Inc. (i3) in order to strengthen its advanced technology PCB capabilities and IP portfolio for emerging applications in the aerospace and defense end market and high end commercial customers. A core differentiator of the acquired technology is the ability to create very fine lines and spacing which is becoming an increasing requirement for new programs across defense and commercial end markets. This substrate-like PCB technology allows for lines and spacing down to 25 microns with 50 micron drill plated through holes. The acquired technology is an alternative approach to achieve similar lines and spacing as the modified semi-additive process (mSAP) we currently utilize in our mobility business. It differs from mSAP in that it is US based and used for lower volume applications such as defense and also for smaller format PCBs used in telecommunication applications. We are excited to add i3s cutting edge technology to TTMs broad base of PCB expertise in North America for deployment in both our commercial and aerospace and defense end markets, said TTMs CEO, Tom Edman. We believe this transaction will allow us to address key future growth opportunities for advanced applications in the defense and commercial markets with the ultimate goal of providing differentiated technical support and value for our customers. The acquired assets will consist of equipment, patents and critical manufacturing know how based on i3s technology base and pedigree along with the future addition of engineering talent all of which serve to enhance TTMs capabilities and credentials as a global technology leader for PCB product solutions and RF components. The i3 equipment in Endicott, New York will be relocated to TTMs Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin campus. The financial terms of the transaction have not been disclosed and will be funded from existing cash on hand.
