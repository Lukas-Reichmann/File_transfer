Total quarterly revenues were up 5% year-over-year in USD and up 4% in constant currency to $12.9 billion. Cloud services and license support revenues were up 12% in USD and up 11% in constant currency to $9.6 billion. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues were down 18% in USD and down 19% in constant currency to $1.2 billion. Q2 GAAP operating income was $3.6 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.5 billion, up 9% in USD and up 7% in constant currency. GAAP operating margin was 28%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 43%. GAAP net income was $2.5 billion. Non-GAAP net income was $3.8 billion, up 14% in USD and up 11% in constant currency. Q2 GAAP earnings per share was $0.89 while non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.34, up 11% in USD and up 9% in constant currency. Short-term deferred revenues were $8.9 billion. Over the last twelve months, operating cash flow was $17.0 billion and free cash flow was $10.1 billion. “Demand for our Cloud Infrastructure and Generative AI services is increasing at an astronomical rate,” said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz. “As a measure of that demand, Oracle’s total Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) climbed to over $65 billion—exceeding annual revenue. Our cloud businesses are now at nearly a $20 billion-dollar annual revenue run rate, and cloud services demand continues to grow at unprecedented levels. Business is good and getting better.” “Oracle is in the process of expanding 66 of our existing cloud datacenters—and building 100 new cloud datacenters—to meet growing demand,” said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison. “We can build our new datacenters very rapidly and operate them inexpensively because they are all highly automated with identical high-performance RDMA networks and the same set of autonomous services. In the next few months, we are turning on 20 new Oracle cloud datacenters collocated with and connected to Microsoft Azure. Simultaneously we are building dozens of new datacenters in countries all over the world. Demand is over the moon.” The board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of outstanding common stock. This dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 11, 2024, with a payment date of January 25, 2024. Earnings Conference Call and Webcast Oracle will hold a conference call and webcast today to discuss these results at 4:00 p.m. Central. A live and replay webcast will be available on the Oracle Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor/.

Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects:  Stock-based compensation expenses : We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, and we believe such compensation contributed to the revenues earned during the periods presented and also believe it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.  Amortization of intangible assets : We have excluded the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.  Acquisition related and other expenses; and restructuring expenses : We have excluded the effect of acquisition related and other expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. We incurred expenses in connection with our acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income, which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations. Acquisition related and other expenses consisted of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net. Restructuring expenses consisted of employee severance and other exit costs. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses. Although acquisition related and other expenses and restructuring expenses may diminish over time with respect to past acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives, we generally will incur certain of these expenses in connection with any future acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives. 9-;-",0001341439,ORCL,"8-K: UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 OR 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): December 11, 2023 Oracle Corporation (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Delaware 001-35992 54-2185193 (State or other jurisdiction of incorporation) (Commission File Number) (IRS Employer Identification No.) 2300 Oracle Way , Austin , Texas 78741 (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) (737) 867-1000 (Registrant’s telephone number, including area code) N/A (Former name or former address, if changed since last report.)

Our cloud businesses are now at nearly a $20 billion-dollar annual revenue run rate, and cloud services demand continues to grow at unprecedented levels. Business is good and getting better.” “Oracle is in the process of expanding 66 of our existing cloud datacenters—and building 100 new cloud datacenters—to meet growing demand,” said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison. “We can build our new datacenters very rapidly and operate them inexpensively because they are all highly automated with identical high-performance RDMA networks and the same set of autonomous services. In the next few months, we are turning on 20 new Oracle cloud datacenters collocated with and connected to Microsoft Azure. Simultaneously we are building dozens of new datacenters in countries all over the world. Demand is over the moon.” The board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of outstanding common stock. This dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 11, 2024, with a payment date of January 25, 2024.

Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects:  Stock-based compensation expenses : We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, and we believe such compensation contributed to the revenues earned during the periods presented and also believe it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.  Amortization of intangible assets : We have excluded the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.  Acquisition related and other expenses; and restructuring expenses : We have excluded the effect of acquisition related and other expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. We incurred expenses in connection with our acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income, which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations. Acquisition related and other expenses consisted of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net. Restructuring expenses consisted of employee severance and other exit costs. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses. Although acquisition related and other expenses and restructuring expenses may diminish over time with respect to past acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives, we generally will incur certain of these expenses in connection with any future acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives. 9"

Total quarterly revenues were up 9% year-over-year in USD and up 8% in constant currency to $12.5 billion. Cloud services and license support revenues were up 13% in USD and up 12% in constant currency to $9.5 billion. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues were down 10% in USD and down 11% in constant currency to $0.8 billion. Q1 GAAP operating income was $3.3 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, up 13% in USD and up 12% in constant currency. GAAP operating margin was 26%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 41%. GAAP net income was $2.4 billion. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, up 19% in USD and up 17% in constant currency. Q1 GAAP earnings per share was $0.86 while non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.19, up 16% in USD and up 14% in constant currency. Short-term deferred revenues were $11.1 billion. Q1 operating cash flow was $7.0 billion, up 9%, and Q1 free cash flow was $5.7 billion, up 21%. “Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue grew 66% in Q1, much faster than our hyperscale cloud infrastructure competitors,” said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz. “Total cloud services revenue, Infrastructure plus Applications, grew 30% to $4.6 billion in the quarter. Oracle Cloud Services plus License Support revenue now accounts for 77% of Oracle’s total revenue. This highly-predictable, highly-profitable recurring revenue stream—combined with continued expense discipline—drove 16% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share, 21% growth in free cash flow, and $7.0 billion in operating cash flow in the Q1.” “Is Generative AI the most important new computer technology ever? Maybe!,” said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison. “Self-driving cars, molecular drug design, voice user interfaces—billions of dollars are being invested in AI. As of today, AI development companies have signed contracts to purchase more than $4 billion of capacity in Oracle’s Gen2 Cloud. That’s twice as much as we had booked at the end of Q4. The largest AI technology companies and the leading AI startups continue to expand their business with Oracle for one simple reason—Oracle’s RDMA interconnected NVIDIA Superclusters train AI models at twice the speed and less than half the cost of other clouds.” The board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of outstanding common stock. This dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 12, 2023, with a payment date of October 26, 2023. Earnings Conference Call and Webcast Oracle will hold a conference call and webcast today to discuss these results at 4:00 p.m. Central.

Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects:  Stock-based compensation expenses : We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, and we believe such compensation contributed to the revenues earned during the periods presented and also believe it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.  Amortization of intangible assets : We have excluded the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.  Acquisition related and other expenses; and restructuring expenses : We have excluded the effect of acquisition related and other expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. We incurred expenses in connection with our acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income, which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations. Acquisition related and other expenses consisted of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net. Restructuring expenses consisted of employee severance and other exit costs. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses. Although acquisition related and other expenses and restructuring expenses may diminish over time with respect to past acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives, we generally will incur certain of these expenses in connection with any future acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives. 7-;-",0001341439,ORCL,"8-K: UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 OR 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): September 11, 2023 Oracle Corporation (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Delaware 001-35992 54-2185193 (State or other jurisdiction of incorporation) (Commission File Number) (IRS Employer Identification No.) 2300 Oracle Way , Austin , Texas 78741 (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) (737) 867-1000 (Registrant’s telephone number, including area code) N/A (Former name or former address, if changed since last report.)

Total quarterly revenues were up 9% year-over-year in USD and up 8% in constant currency to $12.5 billion. Cloud services and license support revenues were up 13% in USD and up 12% in constant currency to $9.5 billion. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues were down 10% in USD and down 11% in constant currency to $0.8 billion. Q1 GAAP operating income was $3.3 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, up 13% in USD and up 12% in constant currency. GAAP operating margin was 26%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 41%. GAAP net income was $2.4 billion. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, up 19% in USD and up 17% in constant currency. Q1 GAAP earnings per share was $0.86 while non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.19, up 16% in USD and up 14% in constant currency. Short-term deferred revenues were $11.1 billion. Q1 operating cash flow was $7.0 billion, up 9%, and Q1 free cash flow was $5.7 billion, up 21%. “Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue grew 66% in Q1, much faster than our hyperscale cloud infrastructure competitors,” said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz. “Total cloud services revenue, Infrastructure plus Applications, grew 30% to $4.6 billion in the quarter. Oracle Cloud Services plus License Support revenue now accounts for 77% of Oracle’s total revenue. This highly-predictable, highly-profitable recurring revenue stream—combined with continued expense discipline—drove 16% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share, 21% growth in free cash flow, and $7.0 billion in operating cash flow in the Q1.” “Is Generative AI the most important new computer technology ever? Maybe!,” said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison. “Self-driving cars, molecular drug design, voice user interfaces—billions of dollars are being invested in AI. As of today, AI development companies have signed contracts to purchase more than $4 billion of capacity in Oracle’s Gen2 Cloud. That’s twice as much as we had booked at the end of Q4. The largest AI technology companies and the leading AI startups continue to expand their business with Oracle for one simple reason—Oracle’s RDMA interconnected NVIDIA Superclusters train AI models at twice the speed and less than half the cost of other clouds.” The board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of outstanding common stock. This dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 12, 2023, with a payment date of October 26, 2023. Earnings Conference Call and Webcast Oracle will hold a conference call and webcast today to discuss these results at 4:00 p.m. Central.

Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects:  Stock-based compensation expenses : We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, and we believe such compensation contributed to the revenues earned during the periods presented and also believe it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.  Amortization of intangible assets : We have excluded the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.  Acquisition related and other expenses; and restructuring expenses : We have excluded the effect of acquisition related and other expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. We incurred expenses in connection with our acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income, which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations. Acquisition related and other expenses consisted of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net. Restructuring expenses consisted of employee severance and other exit costs. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses. Although acquisition related and other expenses and restructuring expenses may diminish over time with respect to past acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives, we generally will incur certain of these expenses in connection with any future acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives. 7"

Segment Results for Second Quarter · Cloud & Cognitive Software (includes cloud and data platforms, cognitive applications and transaction processing platforms) — revenues of $5.6 billion, up 3.2 percent (up 5.4 percent adjusting for currency), with growth in cloud and data platforms, up 5 percent (up 7 percent adjusting for currency); cognitive applications, up 3 percent (up 5 percent adjusting for currency); and transaction processing platforms, up 2 percent (up 4 percent adjusting for currency). · Global Business Services (includes consulting, application management and global process services) — revenues of $4.2 billion, up 0.5 percent (up 3.4 percent adjusting for currency), with broad-based strength led by growth in consulting, up 2 percent (up 5 percent adjusting for currency). · Global Technology Services ( includes infrastructure and cloud services and technology support services) — revenues of $6.8 billion, down 6.7 percent (down 3.5 percent adjusting for currency). Gross profit margin increased 120 basis points. · Systems (includes systems hardware and operating systems software) — revenues of $1.8 billion, down 19.5 percent (down 18.0 percent adjusting for currency), with growth in Power, more than offset by the impact of product cycle dynamics in IBM Z and Storage. · Global Financing (includes financing and used equipment sales) — revenues of $351 million, down 11.0 percent (down 8.5 percent adjusting for currency), reflects the wind-down of OEM commercial financing. Full-Year 2019 Expectations Through the second quarter, IBM remains on track to achieve GAAP diluted earnings per share of at least $12.45, operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of at least $13.90 and free cash flow of approximately $12 billion, all excluding the impact of Red Hat and related activity. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share expectations exclude $1.45 per share of charges for amortization of purchased intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, including pre-closing charges, such as financing costs associated with the Red Hat acquisition; retirement-related charges; and tax reform enactment impacts. It does not include any other amounts for Red Hat or Red Hat related activity. The company will provide an update to these full-year expectations (including GAAP EPS expectations) on August 2, 2019 to reflect the addition of the recently-closed Red Hat acquisition. IBM continues to expect Red Hat, including related activity, to be accretive to free cash flow in the first year; accretive to operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share by the end of the second year after closing; and dilutive to full-year 2019 earnings per share due primarily to a non-cash purchase accounting adjustment. Year-To-Date 2019 Results Consolidated diluted earnings per share was $4.58 compared to $4.43, up 3 percent year to year. Consolidated net income was $4.1 billion, flat year to year. Revenues for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019 totaled $37.3 billion, a decrease of 4 percent year to year (down 1 percent adjusting for currency) compared with $39.1 billion for the first six months of 2018. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $5.42 compared with $5.53 per diluted share for the 2018 period, a decrease of 2 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) net income for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $4.8 billion compared with $5.1 billion in the prior-year period, a decrease of 5 percent. Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements Except for the historical information and discussions contained herein, statements contained in this release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on the company’s current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, including, but not limited to, the following: a downturn in economic environment and client spending budgets; the company’s failure to meet growth and productivity objectives; a failure of the company’s innovation initiatives; damage to the company’s reputation; risks from investing in growth opportunities; failure of the company’s intellectual property portfolio to prevent competitive offerings and the failure of the company to obtain necessary licenses; cybersecurity and data privacy considerations; fluctuations in financial results, impact of local legal, economic, political and health conditions; adverse effects from environmental matters, tax matters and the company’s pension plans; ineffective internal controls; the company’s use of accounting estimates; the company’s ability to attract and retain key employees and its reliance on critical skills; impacts of relationships with critical suppliers; product quality issues; impacts of business with government clients; currency fluctuations and customer financing risks; impact of changes in market liquidity conditions and customer credit risk on receivables; reliance on third party distribution channels and ecosystems; the company’s ability to successfully manage acquisitions, alliances and dispositions, including integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, the assumption of liabilities, and higher debt levels; legal proceedings and investigatory risks; risk factors related to IBM securities; and other risks, uncertainties and factors discussed in the company’s Form 10‑Qs, Form 10‑K and in the company’s other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or in materials incorporated therein by reference.

Except as required by law, the company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Presentation of Information in this Press Release In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company’s results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company has also disclosed in this press release the following non-GAAP information, which management believes provides useful information to investors: IBM results — · presenting operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share amounts and related income statement items; · adjusting for free cash flow; · net cash from operating activities, excluding Global Financing receivables; · adjusting for currency (i.e., at constant currency). Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows. The company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result, the company does not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric. The rationale for management’s use of these non-GAAP measures is included in Exhibit 99.2 in the Form 8‑K that includes this press release and is being submitted today to the SEC. Conference Call and Webcast IBM’s regular quarterly earnings conference call is scheduled to begin at 5:00 p.m. EDT, today. The Webcast may be accessed via a link at http://www.ibm.com/investor/events/earnings/2q19.html. Presentation charts will be available shortly before the Webcast.

This amount includes pre-closing charges, such as financing costs, associated with the Red Hat acquisition. It does not include any other amounts for Red Hat or Red Hat related activity. -;-EX-99.2: Exhibit 99.2 Non-GAAP Financial Information Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items In an effort to provide better transparency into the operational results of the business, supplementally, the company separates business results into operating and non-operating categories. Operating earnings from continuing operations is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, intangible asset amortization expense resulting from basis differences on equity method investments, retirement-related costs and discontinued operations and their related tax impacts. Due to the unique, non-recurring nature of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. tax reform”), the company characterizes the one-time provisional charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjustments to that charge as non-operating. Adjustments include true-ups, accounting elections, any changes to regulations, laws, audit adjustments, etc. that affect the recorded one-time charge. For acquisitions, operating (non-GAAP) earnings exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, tax charges related to acquisition integration and pre-closing charges, such as financing costs. These charges are excluded as they may be inconsistent in amount and timing from period to period and are significantly impacted by the size, type and frequency of the company’s acquisitions. All other spending for acquired companies is included in both earnings from continuing operations and in operating (non-GAAP) earnings. For retirement-related costs, the company characterizes certain items as operating and others as non-operating, consistent with GAAP. The company includes defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan service costs, multi-employer plan costs and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related costs include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan amortization of prior service costs, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements and pension insolvency costs and other costs. Non-operating retirement-related costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance, and the company considers these costs to be outside of the operational performance of the business. Overall, the company believes that supplementally providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company’s pension plans; improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows the company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. The company’s reportable segment financial results reflect pre-tax operating earnings from continuing operations, consistent with the company’s management and measurement system. In addition, these non-GAAP measures provide a perspective consistent with areas of interest the company routinely receives from investors and analysts. Free Cash Flow The company uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows. Since the company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which it seeks to maximize, it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result the company does not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric. Constant Currency When the company refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusts such growth rates for currency, it is done so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of its business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period’s currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates. -;-EX-99.3:Exhibit 99.3 IBM 2Q 2019 Earnings July 17, 2019 ibm.com/investor 1 2 Certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on the company’s current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. Those statements by their nature address matters that are uncertain to different degrees. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the Company’s filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM web site, or from IBM Investor Relations. Any forward-looking statement made during this presentation speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. These charts and the associated remarks and comments are integrally related, and are intended to be presented and understood together. In an effort to provide additional and useful information regarding the company’s financial results and other financial information as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, certain non-GAAP information including “operating earnings”, other “operating” financial measures, including free cash flow, net cash from operating activities excluding Global Financing receivables, and adjustments for currency. The rationale for management’s use of this non- GAAP information is included as Exhibit 99.2 to the company’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 17, 2019. The reconciliation of non-GAAP information to GAAP is included on the slides entitled “Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials” in this presentation, as well as in Exhibit 99.1 to the company’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 17, 2019.

IBM’s free cash flow was $2.4 billion. IBM returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through $1.4 billion in dividends and $0.3 billion in gross share repurchases. The company suspended its share repurchase program on July 9. IBM ended the second quarter with $46.4 billion of cash on hand, of which approximately $34 billion was used in July to close the acquisition of Red Hat. Debt totaled $73.0 billion, including Global Financing debt of $25.0 billion. Segment Results for Second Quarter · Cloud & Cognitive Software (includes cloud and data platforms, cognitive applications and transaction processing platforms) — revenues of $5.6 billion, up 3.2 percent (up 5.4 percent adjusting for currency), with growth in cloud and data platforms, up 5 percent (up 7 percent adjusting for currency); cognitive applications, up 3 percent (up 5 percent adjusting for currency); and transaction processing platforms, up 2 percent (up 4 percent adjusting for currency). · Global Business Services (includes consulting, application management and global process services) — revenues of $4.2 billion, up 0.5 percent (up 3.4 percent adjusting for currency), with broad-based strength led by growth in consulting, up 2 percent (up 5 percent adjusting for currency). · Global Technology Services ( includes infrastructure and cloud services and technology support services) — revenues of $6.8 billion, down 6.7 percent (down 3.5 percent adjusting for currency). Gross profit margin increased 120 basis points. · Systems (includes systems hardware and operating systems software) — revenues of $1.8 billion, down 19.5 percent (down 18.0 percent adjusting for currency), with growth in Power, more than offset by the impact of product cycle dynamics in IBM Z and Storage. · Global Financing (includes financing and used equipment sales) — revenues of $351 million, down 11.0 percent (down 8.5 percent adjusting for currency), reflects the wind-down of OEM commercial financing. Full-Year 2019 Expectations Through the second quarter, IBM remains on track to achieve GAAP diluted earnings per share of at least $12.45, operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of at least $13.90 and free cash flow of approximately $12 billion, all excluding the impact of Red Hat and related activity. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share expectations exclude $1.45 per share of charges for amortization of purchased intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, including pre-closing charges, such as financing costs associated with the Red Hat acquisition; retirement-related charges; and tax reform enactment impacts. It does not include any other amounts for Red Hat or Red Hat related activity. The company will provide an update to these full-year expectations (including GAAP EPS expectations) on August 2, 2019 to reflect the addition of the recently-closed Red Hat acquisition. IBM continues to expect Red Hat, including related activity, to be accretive to free cash flow in the first year; accretive to operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share by the end of the second year after closing; and dilutive to full-year 2019 earnings per share due primarily to a non-cash purchase accounting adjustment. Year-To-Date 2019 Results Consolidated diluted earnings per share was $4.58 compared to $4.43, up 3 percent year to year. Consolidated net income was $4.1 billion, flat year to year. Revenues for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019 totaled $37.3 billion, a decrease of 4 percent year to year (down 1 percent adjusting for currency) compared with $39.1 billion for the first six months of 2018. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $5.42 compared with $5.53 per diluted share for the 2018 period, a decrease of 2 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) net income for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $4.8 billion compared with $5.1 billion in the prior-year period, a decrease of 5 percent.

Forward-looking statements are based on the company’s current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, including, but not limited to, the following: a downturn in economic environment and client spending budgets; the company’s failure to meet growth and productivity objectives; a failure of the company’s innovation initiatives; damage to the company’s reputation; risks from investing in growth opportunities; failure of the company’s intellectual property portfolio to prevent competitive offerings and the failure of the company to obtain necessary licenses; cybersecurity and data privacy considerations; fluctuations in financial results, impact of local legal, economic, political and health conditions; adverse effects from environmental matters, tax matters and the company’s pension plans; ineffective internal controls; the company’s use of accounting estimates; the company’s ability to attract and retain key employees and its reliance on critical skills; impacts of relationships with critical suppliers; product quality issues; impacts of business with government clients; currency fluctuations and customer financing risks; impact of changes in market liquidity conditions and customer credit risk on receivables; reliance on third party distribution channels and ecosystems; the company’s ability to successfully manage acquisitions, alliances and dispositions, including integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, the assumption of liabilities, and higher debt levels; legal proceedings and investigatory risks; risk factors related to IBM securities; and other risks, uncertainties and factors discussed in the company’s Form 10‑Qs, Form 10‑K and in the company’s other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or in materials incorporated therein by reference.

Except as required by law, the company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Presentation of Information in this Press Release In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company’s results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company has also disclosed in this press release the following non-GAAP information, which management believes provides useful information to investors: IBM results — · presenting operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share amounts and related income statement items; · adjusting for free cash flow; · net cash from operating activities, excluding Global Financing receivables; · adjusting for currency (i.e., at constant currency). Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows. The company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result, the company does not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric. The rationale for management’s use of these non-GAAP measures is included in Exhibit 99.2 in the Form 8‑K that includes this press release and is being submitted today to the SEC. Conference Call and Webcast IBM’s regular quarterly earnings conference call is scheduled to begin at 5:00 p.m. EDT, today.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Red Hat (the “Merger”), with Red Hat surviving the Merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM. IBM funded the acquisition and transactions relating thereto with cash on hand. As previously disclosed, IBM issued debt in 2019. IBM acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Red Hat for $190.00 per share in cash, representing a total equity value of approximately $34 billion. Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. The description contained under the Introductory Note above is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Item 2.01. The description of the effects of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by reference to, the full text of the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to IBM’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 29, 2018 and which is incorporated herein by reference. Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. On July 9, 2019, IBM and Red Hat issued a joint press release announcing the completion of the acquisition of Red Hat.

Item 8.01 Other Events. In connection with the consummation of the Merger, Red Hat and U.S. Bank National Association (the “Convertible Notes Trustee”) entered into a Supplemental Indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture”), dated as of July 9, 2019, which supplements the Indenture, dated as of October 7, 2014 (as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, the “Indenture”), by and between Red Hat and the Convertible Notes Trustee, governing Red Hat’s 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the “Convertible Notes”), of which approximately $186.9 million aggregate principal amount was outstanding on July 8, 2019. The Supplemental Indenture provides that, from and after the effective time of the Merger, the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes will be changed into a right to convert such principal amount of the Convertible Notes into $190.00 in cash in respect of each share of Red Hat common stock into which the Convertible Notes would otherwise be convertible. The consummation of the Merger constitutes a Fundamental Change and a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (each as defined in the Indenture) under the Indenture and the effective date of such Fundamental Change and such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is July 9, 2019. Following the Merger, each holder of the Convertible Notes has the right to (i) convert its Convertible Notes into $190.00 in cash in respect of each share of Red Hat common stock into which the Convertible Notes would have otherwise been convertible, or (ii) require that Red Hat repurchase such holder’s Convertible Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal the principal amount of such Convertible Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The Convertible Notes will mature on October 1, 2019. Red Hat intends to provide notice to the Convertible Notes Trustee within three business days of its intent to effect the repurchase of the Convertible Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

Del Bene Vice President and Controller -;-EX-99.1:EX-99.1 2 eh1900893_ex9901.htm EXHIBIT 99.1 EXHIBIT 99.1 IBM Closes Landmark Acquisition of Red Hat for $34 Billion; Defines Open, Hybrid Cloud Future - Acquisition positions IBM as the leading hybrid cloud provider and accelerates IBM’s high-value business model, extending Red Hat’s open source innovation to a broader range of clients - IBM preserves Red Hat’s independence and neutrality; Red Hat will strengthen its existing partnerships to give customers freedom, choice and flexibility - Red Hat’s unwavering commitment to open source remains unchanged - Together, IBM and Red Hat will deliver next-generation hybrid multicloud platform ARMONK, N.Y. and RALEIGH, N.C., July 9, 2019 -- IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Red Hat (NYSE: RHT) announced today that they have closed the transaction under which IBM acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Red Hat for $190.00 per share in cash, representing a total equity value of approximately $34 billion. The acquisition redefines the cloud market for business. Red Hat’s open hybrid cloud technologies are now paired with the unmatched scale and depth of IBM’s innovation and industry expertise, and sales leadership in more than 175 countries. Together, IBM and Red Hat will accelerate innovation by offering a next-generation hybrid multicloud platform. Based on open source technologies, such as Linux and Kubernetes, the platform will allow businesses to securely deploy, run and manage data and applications on-premises and on private and multiple public clouds. “Businesses are starting the next chapter of their digital reinventions, modernizing infrastructure and moving mission-critical workloads across private clouds and multiple clouds from multiple vendors,” said Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and CEO. “They need open, flexible technology to manage these hybrid multicloud environments. And they need partners they can trust to manage and secure these systems. IBM and Red Hat are uniquely suited to meet these needs. As the leading hybrid cloud provider, we will help clients forge the technology foundations of their business for decades to come.” “When we talk to customers, their challenges are clear: They need to move faster and differentiate through technology. They want to build more collaborative cultures, and they need solutions that give them the flexibility to build and deploy any app or workload, anywhere,” said Jim Whitehurst, president and CEO, Red Hat. “We think open source has become the de facto standard in technology because it enables these solutions. Joining forces with IBM gives Red Hat the opportunity to bring more open source innovation to an even broader range of organizations and will enable us to scale to meet the need for hybrid cloud solutions that deliver true choice and agility.” Red Hat will continue to be led by Jim Whitehurst and its current management team. Whitehurst is joining IBM’s senior management team, reporting to Ginni Rometty. IBM will maintain Red Hat’s headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, its facilities, brands and practices. Red Hat will operate as a distinct unit within IBM and will be reported as part of IBM’s Cloud and Cognitive Software segment. Both companies have already built leading enterprise cloud businesses with consistent strong revenue growth by helping customers transition their business models to the cloud. IBM’s cloud revenue has grown from 4 percent of total revenue in 2013 to 25 percent today. This growth comes through a comprehensive range of as-a-service offerings and software, services and hardware that enable IBM to advise, build, move and manage cloud solutions across public, private and on-premises environments for customers. IBM cloud revenue for the 12-month period through the first quarter of this year grew to over $19 billion. The Red Hat acquisition is expected to contribute approximately two points of compound annual revenue growth to IBM over a five-year period. Red Hat’s fiscal year 2019 revenue was $3.4 billion, up 15 percent year-over-year. Fiscal first quarter 2020 revenue, reported in June, was $934 million, up 15 percent year-over-year. In that quarter, subscription revenue was up 15 percent year-over-year, including revenue from application development-related and other emerging technology offerings up 24 percent year-over-year. Services revenue also grew 17 percent. The Hybrid Cloud Opportunity Digital reinvention is at an inflection point as businesses enter the next chapter of their cloud journey. Most enterprises today are approximately 20 percent into their transition to the cloud. In this first chapter of their cloud journey, businesses made great strides in reducing costs, boosting productivity and revitalizing their customer-facing innovation programs. Chapter two, however, is about shifting mission-critical workloads to the cloud and optimizing everything from supply chains to core banking systems. To succeed in the next chapter of the cloud, businesses need to manage their entire IT infrastructure, on and off-premises and across different clouds – private and public – in a way that is simple, consistent and integrated. Businesses are seeking one common environment they can build once and deploy in any one of the appropriate footprints to be faster and more agile. IBM’s offerings have evolved to reflect new customer needs and drive greater growth. The acquisition of Red Hat further strengthens IBM as the leader in hybrid cloud for the enterprise. “As organizations seek to increase their pace of innovation to stay competitive, they are looking to open source and a distributed cloud environment to enable a new wave of digital innovation that wasn’t possible before. Over the next five years, IDC expects enterprises to invest heavily in their journeys to the cloud, and innovation on it. A large and increasing portion of this investment will be on open hybrid and multicloud environments that enable them to move apps, data and workloads across different environments,” said Frank Gens, Senior Vice President and Chief Analyst, IDC. “With the acquisition of Red Hat, and IBM’s commitment to Red Hat’s independence, IBM is well positioned to help enterprises differentiate themselves in their industry by capitalizing on open source in this emerging hybrid and multicloud world.” The collective ability of IBM and Red Hat to unlock the true value of hybrid cloud for businesses is already resonating among customers moving to the next chapter of digital reinvention. “ Delta is constantly exploring current and emerging technology as we transform the air travel experience,” said Ed Bastian, Delta CEO. “We’ve been working with both IBM and Red Hat for years to deliver on that goal, and as they together build the next generation IT company, they will be an essential part of our digital transformation.” “As a long-standing partner of Red Hat and IBM, we look forward to capabilities that these two companies will bring together,” said Michael Poser, Managing Director and Chief Information Officer, Enterprise Technology & Services, Morgan Stanley. “We know first-hand how important and impactful cloud technology contributes to unlocking business value.” IBM Reinforces Commitment to Open Source and Red Hat Neutrality IBM and Red Hat have deep open source values and experience. The two companies have worked together for more than 20 years to make open source the default choice for modern IT solutions. This includes the importance of open governance and helping open source projects and communities flourish through continued contribution. With Red Hat, IBM has acquired one of the most important software companies in the IT industry. Red Hat’s pioneering business model helped bring open source – including technologies like Linux, Kubernetes, Ansible, Java, Ceph and many more – into the mainstream for enterprises. Today, Linux is the most used platform for development. Red Hat Enterprise Linux alone is expected to contribute to more than $10 trillion worth of global business revenues in 2019. By 2023, an additional 640,000 people are expected to work in Red Hat-related jobs. 2 IBM has committed to scaling and accelerating open source and hybrid cloud for businesses across industries, as well as preserving the independence and neutrality of Red Hat’s open source heritage. This includes its open source community leadership, contributions and development model; product portfolio, services, and go-to-market strategy; robust developer and partner ecosystems, and unique culture. Red Hat’s mission and unwavering commitment to open source will remain unchanged, and Red Hat will continue to offer the choice and flexibility inherent to open source and hybrid IT environments. Red Hat also will continue to build and expand its partnerships, including those with major cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Alibaba. IBM and Red Hat also share a strong commitment to social responsibility and a sense of purpose for applying technology and expertise to help address some of the world’s most significant societal challenges. Together, the two companies have committed to expanding this longstanding commitment through new joint initiatives, addressing education and skills, civic and societal needs and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) workforce development.

The announcement press release, which includes additional perspective on the opportunity and business value is here . Business Summary IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat redefines the cloud market for business. Red Hat’s open hybrid cloud technologies are now paired with the unmatched scale and depth of IBM’s innovation and industry expertise, and sales leadership in more than 175 countries. Together, IBM and Red Hat will accelerate innovation, and shift our clients’ mission-critical workloads to the cloud by offering a next-generation hybrid multicloud platform. Based on open source technologies, such as Linux and Kubernetes, the platform will allow businesses to securely deploy, run and manage data and applications on-premises and on private and multiple public clouds. IBM is preserving Red Hat’s independence and neutrality and Red Hat will strengthen its existing partnerships to continue to give customers freedom, choice and flexibility. Both companies have already built leading enterprise cloud businesses with consistent strong revenue growth, as they help customers transition their business models to the cloud. IBM cloud revenue for the 12-month period through the first quarter of this year grew to over $19 billion, reflecting a comprehensive range of as-a-service offerings, and software, hardware and services that enable IBM to advise, build, move and manage cloud solutions across public, private and on-premises environments for customers. Financial Implications This transaction accelerates IBM’s revenue growth, contributes to its high value model, and enhances its free cash flow generation. As a standalone business, Red Hat has a strong financial profile, with revenue consistently growing at a double-digit rate. Red Hat is also a high value business as evidenced by its gross and pre-tax profit margins and strong free cash flow. Red Hat will be reported as part of IBM’s Cloud and Cognitive Software segment. The addition of Red Hat will accelerate IBM’s revenue growth, expecting to add approximately 200 basis points over the next five years through a combination of Red Hat’s existing business, continued growth in Red Hat, and cross-selling opportunities across IBM’s software and services businesses. The transaction is expected to be accretive to both operating gross profit margin and free cash flow in the first year, and accretive to IBM’s operating earnings per share by the end of the second year, with the near-term EPS dilution driven primarily by a non-cash purchase accounting adjustment. In an acquisition, US GAAP requires the buyer at closing to record the acquired deferred revenue balance at fair value. This results in a non-cash adjustment to the deferred revenue balance and a reduction to reported revenue post-closing. The level of adjustment will reflect the margin profile of Red Hat’s business, and deferred revenue will be replenished over the subsequent two to three years, given Red Hat’s high renewal rates and a stable and growing client base. IBM acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Red Hat for $190 per share in cash, representing a total equity value of approximately $34 billion. The transaction was funded through a combination of debt and cash, with the incremental debt issued earlier this year. The company will continue its disciplined financial policy and is committed to maintaining its strong investment grade credit ratings, targeting a leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating within a couple of years. IBM suspended its share repurchase program at the time of closing. At the same time the company is maintaining its solid and growing dividend. Additional Information IBM will report its second quarter 2019 earnings on July 17, 2019 and host its annual Investor Briefing webcast on August 2, 2019. On July 17, IBM will provide a view of its 2019 full year performance excluding the addition of Red Hat and Red Hat-related activity. This provides transparency into the company’s underlying business performance, and is on a basis consistent with the company’s previous guidance and first-half results. During its Investor Briefing on August 2, the company will provide a view of earnings per share and free cash flow expectations for 2019 and the medium term, reflecting the addition of Red Hat’s business and other Red Hat-related activity, including the non-cash impact of the deferred revenue adjustment, transaction-related charges which are also primarily non-cash, and incremental interest expense.

The acquisition redefines the cloud market for business. Red Hat’s open hybrid cloud technologies are now paired with the unmatched scale and depth of IBM’s innovation and industry expertise, and sales leadership in more than 175 countries. Together, IBM and Red Hat will accelerate innovation by offering a next-generation hybrid multicloud platform. Based on open source technologies, such as Linux and Kubernetes, the platform will allow businesses to securely deploy, run and manage data and applications on-premises and on private and multiple public clouds. “Businesses are starting the next chapter of their digital reinventions, modernizing infrastructure and moving mission-critical workloads across private clouds and multiple clouds from multiple vendors,” said Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and CEO. “They need open, flexible technology to manage these hybrid multicloud environments. And they need partners they can trust to manage and secure these systems. IBM and Red Hat are uniquely suited to meet these needs. As the leading hybrid cloud provider, we will help clients forge the technology foundations of their business for decades to come.” “When we talk to customers, their challenges are clear: They need to move faster and differentiate through technology. They want to build more collaborative cultures, and they need solutions that give them the flexibility to build and deploy any app or workload, anywhere,” said Jim Whitehurst, president and CEO, Red Hat. “We think open source has become the de facto standard in technology because it enables these solutions. Joining forces with IBM gives Red Hat the opportunity to bring more open source innovation to an even broader range of organizations and will enable us to scale to meet the need for hybrid cloud solutions that deliver true choice and agility.” Red Hat will continue to be led by Jim Whitehurst and its current management team. Whitehurst is joining IBM’s senior management team, reporting to Ginni Rometty. IBM will maintain Red Hat’s headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, its facilities, brands and practices. Red Hat will operate as a distinct unit within IBM and will be reported as part of IBM’s Cloud and Cognitive Software segment. Both companies have already built leading enterprise cloud businesses with consistent strong revenue growth by helping customers transition their business models to the cloud. IBM’s cloud revenue has grown from 4 percent of total revenue in 2013 to 25 percent today. This growth comes through a comprehensive range of as-a-service offerings and software, services and hardware that enable IBM to advise, build, move and manage cloud solutions across public, private and on-premises environments for customers. IBM cloud revenue for the 12-month period through the first quarter of this year grew to over $19 billion. The Red Hat acquisition is expected to contribute approximately two points of compound annual revenue growth to IBM over a five-year period. Red Hat’s fiscal year 2019 revenue was $3.4 billion, up 15 percent year-over-year. Fiscal first quarter 2020 revenue, reported in June, was $934 million, up 15 percent year-over-year. In that quarter, subscription revenue was up 15 percent year-over-year, including revenue from application development-related and other emerging technology offerings up 24 percent year-over-year. Services revenue also grew 17 percent. The Hybrid Cloud Opportunity Digital reinvention is at an inflection point as businesses enter the next chapter of their cloud journey. Most enterprises today are approximately 20 percent into their transition to the cloud. In this first chapter of their cloud journey, businesses made great strides in reducing costs, boosting productivity and revitalizing their customer-facing innovation programs. Chapter two, however, is about shifting mission-critical workloads to the cloud and optimizing everything from supply chains to core banking systems. To succeed in the next chapter of the cloud, businesses need to manage their entire IT infrastructure, on and off-premises and across different clouds – private and public – in a way that is simple, consistent and integrated. Businesses are seeking one common environment they can build once and deploy in any one of the appropriate footprints to be faster and more agile. IBM’s offerings have evolved to reflect new customer needs and drive greater growth. The acquisition of Red Hat further strengthens IBM as the leader in hybrid cloud for the enterprise. “As organizations seek to increase their pace of innovation to stay competitive, they are looking to open source and a distributed cloud environment to enable a new wave of digital innovation that wasn’t possible before. Over the next five years, IDC expects enterprises to invest heavily in their journeys to the cloud, and innovation on it. A large and increasing portion of this investment will be on open hybrid and multicloud environments that enable them to move apps, data and workloads across different environments,” said Frank Gens, Senior Vice President and Chief Analyst, IDC. “With the acquisition of Red Hat, and IBM’s commitment to Red Hat’s independence, IBM is well positioned to help enterprises differentiate themselves in their industry by capitalizing on open source in this emerging hybrid and multicloud world.” The collective ability of IBM and Red Hat to unlock the true value of hybrid cloud for businesses is already resonating among customers moving to the next chapter of digital reinvention. “ Delta is constantly exploring current and emerging technology as we transform the air travel experience,” said Ed Bastian, Delta CEO. “We’ve been working with both IBM and Red Hat for years to deliver on that goal, and as they together build the next generation IT company, they will be an essential part of our digital transformation.” “As a long-standing partner of Red Hat and IBM, we look forward to capabilities that these two companies will bring together,” said Michael Poser, Managing Director and Chief Information Officer, Enterprise Technology & Services, Morgan Stanley. “We know first-hand how important and impactful cloud technology contributes to unlocking business value.” IBM Reinforces Commitment to Open Source and Red Hat Neutrality IBM and Red Hat have deep open source values and experience. The two companies have worked together for more than 20 years to make open source the default choice for modern IT solutions. This includes the importance of open governance and helping open source projects and communities flourish through continued contribution. With Red Hat, IBM has acquired one of the most important software companies in the IT industry. Red Hat’s pioneering business model helped bring open source – including technologies like Linux, Kubernetes, Ansible, Java, Ceph and many more – into the mainstream for enterprises. Today, Linux is the most used platform for development. Red Hat Enterprise Linux alone is expected to contribute to more than $10 trillion worth of global business revenues in 2019. By 2023, an additional 640,000 people are expected to work in Red Hat-related jobs. 2 IBM has committed to scaling and accelerating open source and hybrid cloud for businesses across industries, as well as preserving the independence and neutrality of Red Hat’s open source heritage. This includes its open source community leadership, contributions and development model; product portfolio, services, and go-to-market strategy; robust developer and partner ecosystems, and unique culture. Red Hat’s mission and unwavering commitment to open source will remain unchanged, and Red Hat will continue to offer the choice and flexibility inherent to open source and hybrid IT environments. Red Hat also will continue to build and expand its partnerships, including those with major cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Alibaba. IBM and Red Hat also share a strong commitment to social responsibility and a sense of purpose for applying technology and expertise to help address some of the world’s most significant societal challenges. Together, the two companies have committed to expanding this longstanding commitment through new joint initiatives, addressing education and skills, civic and societal needs and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) workforce development.
