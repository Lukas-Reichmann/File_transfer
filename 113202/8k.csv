Dated: October 18, 2023 /s/ Kathleen S. Kiefer 4 -;-EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 ELEVANCE HEALTH REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2023 RESULTS Third quarter GAAP net income was $5.45 per share, including net negative adjustment items of $3.54 per share. Adjusted net income was $8.99* per share. Operating gain, excluding adjustment items, grew 12.6% year-over-year to $2.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $2.6 billion. Indianapolis, Ind. - October 18, 2023 - Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) reported third quarter 2023 results reflecting strong financial performance across the enterprise. Elevance Health delivered another quarter of solid performance reflecting the strength and balance of our diversified portfolio of businesses, our continued investments in innovation and growth, and our relentless focus on affordability, simplicity, and customer experience, said Gail K. Boudreaux, President and CEO. With affordability a paramount concern for all payors and a more uncertain forward-looking operating environment, we took action during the third quarter that will enhance our ability to act nimbly and operate efficiently. Along with the earnings power of our Health Benefits and Carelon businesses, we are well-positioned to meet our commitments to all of our stakeholders while continuing to advance our whole health strategy. As a result of outperformance year-to-date, the Company now expects GAAP net income to be greater than $26.40 per share in 2023, and adjusted net income to be greater than $33.00 per share. Refer to GAAP reconciliation tables on page 14. 1 CONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS Earnings Per Share: GAAP net income was $5.45 per share in the third quarter, including net negative adjustment items of $3.54 per share. Adjusted net income was $8.99* per share. Please refer to the GAAP reconciliation tables on page 14. Membership: Medical membership totaled approximately 47.3 million as of September 30, 2023, an increase of 42 thousand, or 0.1 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in BlueCard, Affordable Care Act health plans, and Medicare Advantage membership, partially offset by attrition in Medicaid due to the resumption of eligibility redeterminations and a new entrant into one of our state Medicaid programs in the third quarter, as well as declines in our Employer Group risk-based business. During the third quarter of 2023, medical membership decreased by 664 thousand driven by attrition in Medicaid due to the aforementioned dynamics. Operating Revenue: Operating revenue was $42.5 billion in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $2.9 billion, or 7.2 percent year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by higher premium revenue in our Health Benefits business and growth in pharmacy product revenue in CarelonRx due to growth in external pharmacy members served and the acquisition of BioPlus in the first quarter of 2023. Benefit Expense Ratio: The benefit expense ratio was 86.8 percent in the third quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points year-over-year. The improvement was driven by premium rate adjustments in recognition of medical cost trend. Medical claims reserves established at December 31, 2022 developed within the range of the Companys expectations as of the third quarter of 2023. Days in Claims Payable: Days in Claims Payable was 48.6 days as of September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.1 days from June 30, 2023 and an increase of 0.9 days compared to September 30, 2022. Operating Expense Ratio: The operating expense ratio was 12.9% percent in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 150 basis points from 11.4% in the third quarter of 2022. The increase was due to a business optimization charge recognized in the quarter. In the third quarter, we completed a strategic review of our operations, assets, and investments to enhance operating efficiency, refine the focus of our investments in innovation and optimize our physical footprint. This resulted in a net charge of $697 million, comprised of the write-off of certain information technology assets and contract exit costs, a reduction in staff including the relocation of certain job functions, and the impairment of assets associated with the closure or partial closure of data centers and offices. Operating Cash Flow: Operating cash flow was approximately $2.6 billion, or 2.0 times net income in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of $2.3 billion as compared to the prior year quarter. The year-on-year decrease was driven by the receipt of an additional month of CMS payments in the third quarter of 2022. 2 Share Repurchase Program : During the third quarter of 2023, the Company repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock for $480 million, at a weighted average price of $451.68. Year-to-date, as of the end of the third quarter, the Company repurchased 3.8 million shares of its common stock for $1.7 billion, at a weighted average price of $462.42. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately $5.1 billion of Board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining. Cash Dividend: During the third quarter of 2023, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $348 million. On October 17, 2023, the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2023 dividend to shareholders of $1.48 per share. The fourth quarter dividend is payable on December 21, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 6, 2023. Investment Portfolio & Capital Position: During the third quarter of 2023, the Company recorded net losses of $124 million. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company recorded net losses of $57 million. These amounts are excluded from adjusted earnings per share. As of September 30, 2023, the Companys net unrealized loss position in the investment portfolio was $2.4 billion, consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities. As of September 30, 2023, cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $1.7 billion. 3 REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Elevance Health has four reportable segments: Health Benefits (comprised of Individual, Employer Group risk-based, Employer Group fee-based, BlueCard, Medicaid, Medicare, and Federal Health Products & Services businesses); CarelonRx; Carelon Services; and Corporate & Other (comprised of businesses that do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating division as well as corporate expenses not allocated to our other reportable segments).

Operating Revenue and Operating Gain for Carelon for the three months ended September 30, 2022 included $7,249 and $516 for CarelonRx; $3,154 and $125 for Carelon Services, respectively. Operating Revenue and Operating Gain for Carelon for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included $25,008 and $1,485 for CarelonRx; $10,127 and $518 for Carelon Services, respectively.

Operating gain for Corporate & Other for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a business optimization charge of $697. See Basis of Presentation on page 6 herein. NM = calculation not meaningful. Health Benefits: Operating gain in the Health Benefits segment totaled $1.8 billion in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $213 million from $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2022, representing growth of 13.0%. The increase was primarily driven by premium rate adjustments to cover medical cost trend on higher levels of post-pandemic care. Carelon: Operating gain in the Carelon segment was $650 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $9 million from $641 million in the third quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the continued expansion of our post-acute care services business, the acquisition of BioPlus in the first quarter of 2023, and improved performance in our Behavioral Health business, partially offset by the non-recurrence of out of period fee-based revenue recognized in the third quarter of 2022 in CarelonRx. 4 Corporate & Other: The Company reported an operating loss of $741 million in the Corporate & Other segment for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of $717 million from an operating loss of $24 million in the third quarter of 2022, driven by business optimization charges. 5 Basis of Presentation Operating revenue and operating gain/loss are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reporting segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Refer to page 14 for the GAAP reconciliation tables. Operating margin is defined as operating gain divided by operating revenue.

Dated: October 18, 2023 /s/ Kathleen S. Kiefer 4 ","EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 ELEVANCE HEALTH REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2023 RESULTS Third quarter GAAP net income was $5.45 per share, including net negative adjustment items of $3.54 per share. Adjusted net income was $8.99* per share. Operating gain, excluding adjustment items, grew 12.6% year-over-year to $2.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $2.6 billion. Indianapolis, Ind. - October 18, 2023 - Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) reported third quarter 2023 results reflecting strong financial performance across the enterprise. Elevance Health delivered another quarter of solid performance reflecting the strength and balance of our diversified portfolio of businesses, our continued investments in innovation and growth, and our relentless focus on affordability, simplicity, and customer experience, said Gail K. Boudreaux, President and CEO. With affordability a paramount concern for all payors and a more uncertain forward-looking operating environment, we took action during the third quarter that will enhance our ability to act nimbly and operate efficiently. Along with the earnings power of our Health Benefits and Carelon businesses, we are well-positioned to meet our commitments to all of our stakeholders while continuing to advance our whole health strategy. As a result of outperformance year-to-date, the Company now expects GAAP net income to be greater than $26.40 per share in 2023, and adjusted net income to be greater than $33.00 per share. Refer to GAAP reconciliation tables on page 14. 1 CONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS Earnings Per Share: GAAP net income was $5.45 per share in the third quarter, including net negative adjustment items of $3.54 per share. Adjusted net income was $8.99* per share. Please refer to the GAAP reconciliation tables on page 14. Membership: Medical membership totaled approximately 47.3 million as of September 30, 2023, an increase of 42 thousand, or 0.1 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in BlueCard, Affordable Care Act health plans, and Medicare Advantage membership, partially offset by attrition in Medicaid due to the resumption of eligibility redeterminations and a new entrant into one of our state Medicaid programs in the third quarter, as well as declines in our Employer Group risk-based business. During the third quarter of 2023, medical membership decreased by 664 thousand driven by attrition in Medicaid due to the aforementioned dynamics. Operating Revenue: Operating revenue was $42.5 billion in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $2.9 billion, or 7.2 percent year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by higher premium revenue in our Health Benefits business and growth in pharmacy product revenue in CarelonRx due to growth in external pharmacy members served and the acquisition of BioPlus in the first quarter of 2023. Benefit Expense Ratio: The benefit expense ratio was 86.8 percent in the third quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points year-over-year. The improvement was driven by premium rate adjustments in recognition of medical cost trend. Medical claims reserves established at December 31, 2022 developed within the range of the Companys expectations as of the third quarter of 2023. Days in Claims Payable: Days in Claims Payable was 48.6 days as of September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.1 days from June 30, 2023 and an increase of 0.9 days compared to September 30, 2022. Operating Expense Ratio: The operating expense ratio was 12.9% percent in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 150 basis points from 11.4% in the third quarter of 2022. The increase was due to a business optimization charge recognized in the quarter. In the third quarter, we completed a strategic review of our operations, assets, and investments to enhance operating efficiency, refine the focus of our investments in innovation and optimize our physical footprint. This resulted in a net charge of $697 million, comprised of the write-off of certain information technology assets and contract exit costs, a reduction in staff including the relocation of certain job functions, and the impairment of assets associated with the closure or partial closure of data centers and offices. Operating Cash Flow: Operating cash flow was approximately $2.6 billion, or 2.0 times net income in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of $2.3 billion as compared to the prior year quarter. The year-on-year decrease was driven by the receipt of an additional month of CMS payments in the third quarter of 2022. 2 Share Repurchase Program : During the third quarter of 2023, the Company repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock for $480 million, at a weighted average price of $451.68. Year-to-date, as of the end of the third quarter, the Company repurchased 3.8 million shares of its common stock for $1.7 billion, at a weighted average price of $462.42. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately $5.1 billion of Board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining. Cash Dividend: During the third quarter of 2023, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $348 million. On October 17, 2023, the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2023 dividend to shareholders of $1.48 per share. The fourth quarter dividend is payable on December 21, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 6, 2023. Investment Portfolio & Capital Position: During the third quarter of 2023, the Company recorded net losses of $124 million. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company recorded net losses of $57 million. These amounts are excluded from adjusted earnings per share. As of September 30, 2023, the Companys net unrealized loss position in the investment portfolio was $2.4 billion, consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities. As of September 30, 2023, cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $1.7 billion. 3 REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Elevance Health has four reportable segments: Health Benefits (comprised of Individual, Employer Group risk-based, Employer Group fee-based, BlueCard, Medicaid, Medicare, and Federal Health Products & Services businesses); CarelonRx; Carelon Services; and Corporate & Other (comprised of businesses that do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating division as well as corporate expenses not allocated to our other reportable segments).

See Basis of Presentation on page 6 herein. NM = calculation not meaningful. Health Benefits: Operating gain in the Health Benefits segment totaled $1.8 billion in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $213 million from $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2022, representing growth of 13.0%. The increase was primarily driven by premium rate adjustments to cover medical cost trend on higher levels of post-pandemic care. Carelon: Operating gain in the Carelon segment was $650 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $9 million from $641 million in the third quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the continued expansion of our post-acute care services business, the acquisition of BioPlus in the first quarter of 2023, and improved performance in our Behavioral Health business, partially offset by the non-recurrence of out of period fee-based revenue recognized in the third quarter of 2022 in CarelonRx. 4 Corporate & Other: The Company reported an operating loss of $741 million in the Corporate & Other segment for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of $717 million from an operating loss of $24 million in the third quarter of 2022, driven by business optimization charges. 5 Basis of Presentation Operating revenue and operating gain/loss are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reporting segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Refer to page 14 for the GAAP reconciliation tables. Operating margin is defined as operating gain divided by operating revenue.

Per $1,000 principal amount. The Total Consideration for Notes validly tendered prior to or at the applicable Early Tender Date (as defined below) and accepted for purchase is calculated using the applicable Fixed Spread and is inclusive of the applicable Early Tender Payment (as defined below). The Total Consideration will be determined by taking into account the applicable par call date for each series of Notes, if any. The offers with respect to the Maximum Tender Offer Notes are subject to the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price of $3.0 billion in aggregate purchase price and the Series Tender Caps. All references to the aggregate purchase price for the Maximum Tender Offer Notes include the applicable Total Consideration or Tender Offer Consideration (as defined below) and exclude applicable accrued interest and fees and expenses related to the Tender Offers. The Offerors will purchase an aggregate principal amount of Maximum Tender Offer Notes having an aggregate purchase price up to the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price, subject to the Acceptance Priority Level and the Series Tender Caps as set forth in the table above. The Offerors reserve the right, but are under no obligation, to increase the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price and/or any Series Tender Cap at any time, including on or after July 10, 2019, subject to applicable law, which could result in the Offerors purchasing an aggregate principal amount of Maximum Tender Offer Notes having a greater aggregate purchase price in the Maximum Tender Offers and/or purchasing an aggregate principal amount of such series of Capped Notes (as defined below) above the applicable sublimit set forth herein. The Tender Offers are being made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, dated June 24, 2019 (the Offer to Purchase), which sets forth the terms and conditions of the Tender Offers. The Tender Offers will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on July 24, 2019 (one minute after 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on July 24, 2019), or any other date and time to which such Tender Offer is extended (such date and time, as it may be extended with respect to a Tender Offer, the Expiration Date), unless earlier terminated. Holders of Notes must validly tender and not validly withdraw their Notes prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 9, 2019, (such date and time, as it may be extended with respect to a Tender Offer, the Early Tender Date), to be eligible to receive the Total Consideration (as defined below), which is inclusive of the applicable cash amount set forth in the above tables under the heading Early Tender Payment (the Early Tender Payment). Holders of Notes who validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Date but prior to the applicable Expiration Date will only be eligible to receive the applicable Tender Offer Consideration. All holders of Notes accepted for purchase will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase from the applicable last interest payment date up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date. The applicable consideration (the Total Consideration) offered per $1,000 principal amount of Notes of each series validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the applicable Tender Offer will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the applicable Fixed Spread for such Notes specified in the tables above plus the applicable yield to maturity based on the bid-side price of the applicable U.S. Treasury Reference Security specified in the tables above as quoted on the applicable page on the Bloomberg Bond Trader at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first business day following the Early Tender Date which is expected to be July 10, 2019. The Tender Offer Consideration is equal to the Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Payment. Maximum Tender Offer Notes tendered prior to or at the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase will be accepted based on the acceptance priority levels noted on the front cover hereof, with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 14 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level (the Acceptance Priority Levels) and will have priority over Maximum Tender Offer Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date, regardless of the Acceptance Priority Levels of the Maximum Tender Offer Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date. Maximum Tender Offer Notes of a series may be subject to proration if the aggregate principal amount of the Maximum Tender Offer Notes of such series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn would cause the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price to be exceeded, or, in the case of each of the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2045, the 4.375% Senior Notes due 2035 and the 3.500% Senior Notes due 2025 (each a Capped Note), if the aggregate principal amount of the Capped Note validly tendered and not validly withdrawn is greater than applicable Series Tender Cap. The Tender Offers will expire on the applicable Expiration Date. The settlement date for the Notes that are validly tendered on or prior to the Early Tender Date is expected to be July 12, 2019, the third business day following the Early Tender Date, assuming the conditions to the satisfaction of the applicable Tender Offer are satisfied.

Notes that are validly tendered may be validly withdrawn at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 9, 2019 (unless extended, the Withdrawal Deadline).

The Offerors, the Company or their affiliates may also from time to time, after completion of the applicable Tender Offer, purchase additional Notes in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through tender or exchange offers or otherwise, or the applicable Offeror may redeem Notes that are redeemable pursuant to their terms. The Offerors obligation to accept for payment and to pay for the Notes validly tendered in the Tender Offers is not subject to any minimum tender condition but is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, including the financing condition that the Offerors shall have closed one or more debt financings resulting in net proceeds in an amount not less than the amount required, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the applicable Tender Offer, to purchase all the Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase in the Tender Offers and to pay accrued interest thereon and fees and expenses associated therewith.
