(Nasdaq: AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 29, 2023, provided guidance for its fiscal year 2024 and announced its quarterly dividend. “Broadcom’s fiscal year 2023 revenue grew 8% year-over-year to a record $35.8 billion, driven by investments in accelerators and network connectivity for AI by hyperscalers,” said Hock Tan, President and CEO of Broadcom Inc. “The acquisition of VMware is transformational. In fiscal year 2024 we expect semiconductor to sustain its mid to high single digit revenue growth rate, with the contribution of VMware driving consolidated revenue to $50 billion, and adjusted EBITDA to $30 billion.” “In fiscal year 2023 we achieved record adjusted EBITDA margin of 65%, generating $17.6 billion in free cash flow or 49% of revenue, demonstrating our stable and diversified business model,” said Kirsten Spears, CFO of Broadcom Inc. “With this transformational acquisition and expected increase in cash flows, we are increasing our quarterly common stock dividend by 14% to $5.25 per share for fiscal year 2024. The target fiscal 2024 annual common stock dividend of $21.00 per share is a record, and the thirteenth consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011.” Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Highlights GAAP Non-GAAP (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Q4 23 Q4 22 Change Q4 23 Q4 22 Change Net revenue $ 9,295 $ 8,930 +4 % $ 9,295 $ 8,930 +4 % Net income $ 3,524 $ 3,359 +$165 $ 4,810 $ 4,544 +$266 Earnings per common share - diluted $ 8.25 $ 7.83 +$0.42 $ 11.06 $ 10.45 +$0.61 ________________________________ (1) The Company is not readily able to provide a reconciliation of the projected non-GAAP financial information presented to the relevant projected GAAP measure without unreasonable effort. 1 (Dollars in millions) Q4 23 Q4 22 Change Cash flow from operations $ 4,828 $ 4,583 +$245 Adjusted EBITDA $ 6,048 $ 5,722 +$326 Free cash flow $ 4,723 $ 4,461 +$262 Net revenue by segment (Dollars in millions) Q4 23 Q4 22 Change Semiconductor solutions $ 7,326 79 % $ 7,092 79 % +3 % Infrastructure software 1,969 21 1,838 21 +7 % Total net revenue $ 9,295 100 % $ 8,930 100 % The Company’s cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal quarter were $14,189 million, compared to $12,055 million at the end of the prior quarter.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures The non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release. Broadcom believes non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company’s on-going performance. Therefore, Broadcom provides this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company’s on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. In addition to GAAP reporting, Broadcom provides investors with net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and other data on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, non-GAAP tax reconciling adjustments, and other adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company’s underlying performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their 3 operations compare to the Company’s operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Company’s competitors. The exclusion of these and other similar items from Broadcom’s non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual. Free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Investors should not consider presentation of free cash flow measures as implying that stockholders have any right to such cash. Broadcom’s free cash flow may not be calculated in a manner comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. About Broadcom Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor, enterprise software and security solutions.

(Nasdaq: AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 29, 2023, provided guidance for its fiscal year 2024 and announced its quarterly dividend. “Broadcom’s fiscal year 2023 revenue grew 8% year-over-year to a record $35.8 billion, driven by investments in accelerators and network connectivity for AI by hyperscalers,” said Hock Tan, President and CEO of Broadcom Inc. “The acquisition of VMware is transformational.

The target fiscal 2024 annual common stock dividend of $21.00 per share is a record, and the thirteenth consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011.” Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Highlights GAAP Non-GAAP (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Q4 23 Q4 22 Change Q4 23 Q4 22 Change Net revenue $ 9,295 $ 8,930 +4 % $ 9,295 $ 8,930 +4 % Net income $ 3,524 $ 3,359 +$165 $ 4,810 $ 4,544 +$266 Earnings per common share - diluted $ 8.25 $ 7.83 +$0.42 $ 11.06 $ 10.45 +$0.61 ________________________________ (1) The Company is not readily able to provide a reconciliation of the projected non-GAAP financial information presented to the relevant projected GAAP measure without unreasonable effort. 1 (Dollars in millions) Q4 23 Q4 22 Change Cash flow from operations $ 4,828 $ 4,583 +$245 Adjusted EBITDA $ 6,048 $ 5,722 +$326 Free cash flow $ 4,723 $ 4,461 +$262 Net revenue by segment (Dollars in millions) Q4 23 Q4 22 Change Semiconductor solutions $ 7,326 79 % $ 7,092 79 % +3 % Infrastructure software 1,969 21 1,838 21 +7 % Total net revenue $ 9,295 100 % $ 8,930 100 % The Company’s cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal quarter were $14,189 million, compared to $12,055 million at the end of the prior quarter.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures The non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release. Broadcom believes non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company’s on-going performance. Therefore, Broadcom provides this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company’s on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. In addition to GAAP reporting, Broadcom provides investors with net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and other data on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, non-GAAP tax reconciling adjustments, and other adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company’s underlying performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their 3 operations compare to the Company’s operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Company’s competitors. The exclusion of these and other similar items from Broadcom’s non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual. Free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Investors should not consider presentation of free cash flow measures as implying that stockholders have any right to such cash. Broadcom’s free cash flow may not be calculated in a manner comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. About Broadcom Broadcom Inc.

On November 22, 2023, Broadcom Inc. (“Broadcom”) completed its acquisition of VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of May 26, 2022, by and among Broadcom, VMware, Verona Holdco, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of VMware (“Holdco”), Verona Merger Sub, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (“Merger Sub 1”), Barcelona Merger Sub 2, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom (“Merger Sub 2”), and Barcelona Merger Sub 3, LLC, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom (“Merger Sub 3”). Pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub 1 merged with and into VMware (the “First Merger”), with VMware continuing as the surviving corporation in the First Merger (the “Surviving Company”) and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco; (ii) following the First Merger, the Surviving Company was converted from a Delaware corporation into a Delaware limited liability company (the “Conversion”); (iii) following the Conversion, Merger Sub 2 merged with and into Holdco (the “Second Merger”), with Holdco continuing as the surviving corporation in the Second Merger (the “Holdco Surviving Company”) and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom; and (iv) following the Second Merger, the Holdco Surviving Company merged with and into Merger Sub 3, with Merger Sub 3 continuing as the surviving limited liability company and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom (the “Third Merger” and together with the First Merger, the Conversion and the Second Merger, the “Mergers”). Each share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of VMware (each, a “VMware Common Share”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Mergers (the “Effective Time”), other than VMware Common Shares owned or held in treasury by VMware or owned by Merger Sub 2 or in the treasury of the Surviving Company (which were cancelled), any VMware Common Shares owned by any wholly owned subsidiary of VMware, and any VMware Common Shares held by stockholders who properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law, was indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such VMware Common Share , and subject to proration in accordance with the Merger Agreement as described below, one of the following forms of consideration (the “Merger Consideration”): • $142.50 in cash, without interest (the “Cash Consideration”) per VMware Common Share; or • 0.25200 of a share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Broadcom (each, a “Broadcom Common Share”) per VMware Common Share (the “Stock Consideration”). The Merger Consideration was subject to proration, such that the total number of VMware Common Shares entitled to receive the Cash Consideration and the total number of VMware Common Shares entitled to receive the Stock Consideration were, in each case, equal to 50% of the aggregate number of VMware Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No fractional Broadcom Common Shares were issued. The results of the Merger Consideration elections were reported in a press release issued by Broadcom and VMware on October 30, 2023. As of the Effective Time, each VMware restricted stock unit award held by a non-employee member of the VMware Board of Directors and each in-the-money VMware stock option vested and was converted into the right to receive, in respect of each underlying share (or in the case of a stock option, each net option share, as calculated pursuant to the Merger Agreement), an amount equal to 50% of the Cash Consideration and a number of Broadcom Common Shares equal to 50% of the Stock Consideration, without interest and less applicable tax withholding. Each outstanding VMware restricted stock unit award not held by a non-employee member of the VMware Board of Directors and each outstanding VMware performance-based restricted stock unit award was converted into a Broadcom restricted stock unit award based on an equity award exchange ratio calculated as the sum of (i) 50% of the Stock Consideration and (ii) 50% of the Cash Consideration divided by the volume weighted average sale price of a Broadcom Common Share over the ten consecutive trading days ending on the second to last trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time. With respect to performance-based restricted stock unit awards, the level of achievement of the applicable performance goals was determined at the Effective Time in the manner described in the Merger Agreement. 2 Broadcom funded the Cash Consideration through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the Credit Agreement referred to below. The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to Broadcom’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 26, 2022 and which is incorporated herein by reference . Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. As previously reported, on August 15, 2023, Broadcom entered into a senior unsecured term loan credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). On November 22, 2023, Broadcom borrowed the full $28,390,625,000 available under the Credit Agreement to fund the Cash Consideration, to provide working capital to Broadcom and its subsidiaries, to refinance existing indebtedness of VMware and its subsidiaries and to pay related costs and expenses. The description of the Credit Agreement is set forth under Item 1.01 in Broadcom’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 16, 2023 (the “Prior 8-K”), which description is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, the Credit Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Prior 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. Item 8.01 Other Events. On November 22, 2023, Broadcom issued a press release announcing the completion of its acquisition of VMware.

On November 22, 2023, Broadcom Inc. (“Broadcom”) completed its acquisition of VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of May 26, 2022, by and among Broadcom, VMware, Verona Holdco, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of VMware (“Holdco”), Verona Merger Sub, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (“Merger Sub 1”), Barcelona Merger Sub 2, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom (“Merger Sub 2”), and Barcelona Merger Sub 3, LLC, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom (“Merger Sub 3”). Pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub 1 merged with and into VMware (the “First Merger”), with VMware continuing as the surviving corporation in the First Merger (the “Surviving Company”) and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco; (ii) following the First Merger, the Surviving Company was converted from a Delaware corporation into a Delaware limited liability company (the “Conversion”); (iii) following the Conversion, Merger Sub 2 merged with and into Holdco (the “Second Merger”), with Holdco continuing as the surviving corporation in the Second Merger (the “Holdco Surviving Company”) and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom; and (iv) following the Second Merger, the Holdco Surviving Company merged with and into Merger Sub 3, with Merger Sub 3 continuing as the surviving limited liability company and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom (the “Third Merger” and together with the First Merger, the Conversion and the Second Merger, the “Mergers”). Each share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of VMware (each, a “VMware Common Share”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Mergers (the “Effective Time”), other than VMware Common Shares owned or held in treasury by VMware or owned by Merger Sub 2 or in the treasury of the Surviving Company (which were cancelled), any VMware Common Shares owned by any wholly owned subsidiary of VMware, and any VMware Common Shares held by stockholders who properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law, was indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such VMware Common Share , and subject to proration in accordance with the Merger Agreement as described below, one of the following forms of consideration (the “Merger Consideration”): • $142.50 in cash, without interest (the “Cash Consideration”) per VMware Common Share; or • 0.25200 of a share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Broadcom (each, a “Broadcom Common Share”) per VMware Common Share (the “Stock Consideration”). The Merger Consideration was subject to proration, such that the total number of VMware Common Shares entitled to receive the Cash Consideration and the total number of VMware Common Shares entitled to receive the Stock Consideration were, in each case, equal to 50% of the aggregate number of VMware Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No fractional Broadcom Common Shares were issued. The results of the Merger Consideration elections were reported in a press release issued by Broadcom and VMware on October 30, 2023. As of the Effective Time, each VMware restricted stock unit award held by a non-employee member of the VMware Board of Directors and each in-the-money VMware stock option vested and was converted into the right to receive, in respect of each underlying share (or in the case of a stock option, each net option share, as calculated pursuant to the Merger Agreement), an amount equal to 50% of the Cash Consideration and a number of Broadcom Common Shares equal to 50% of the Stock Consideration, without interest and less applicable tax withholding. Each outstanding VMware restricted stock unit award not held by a non-employee member of the VMware Board of Directors and each outstanding VMware performance-based restricted stock unit award was converted into a Broadcom restricted stock unit award based on an equity award exchange ratio calculated as the sum of (i) 50% of the Stock Consideration and (ii) 50% of the Cash Consideration divided by the volume weighted average sale price of a Broadcom Common Share over the ten consecutive trading days ending on the second to last trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time. With respect to performance-based restricted stock unit awards, the level of achievement of the applicable performance goals was determined at the Effective Time in the manner described in the Merger Agreement. 2 Broadcom funded the Cash Consideration through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the Credit Agreement referred to below. The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to Broadcom’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 26, 2022 and which is incorporated herein by reference . Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. As previously reported, on August 15, 2023, Broadcom entered into a senior unsecured term loan credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). On November 22, 2023, Broadcom borrowed the full $28,390,625,000 available under the Credit Agreement to fund the Cash Consideration, to provide working capital to Broadcom and its subsidiaries, to refinance existing indebtedness of VMware and its subsidiaries and to pay related costs and expenses. The description of the Credit Agreement is set forth under Item 1.01 in Broadcom’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 16, 2023 (the “Prior 8-K”), which description is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, the Credit Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Prior 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. Item 8.01 Other Events.

FTE basis is a performance measure used in operating the business that management believes provides investors a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. We believe that this presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $12.3 billion, $12.5 billion and $12.0 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. The FTE adjustment was $149 million, $153 million and $154 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. B Global Markets revenue and net income, excluding net debit valuation adjustments (DVA), and sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, are non- GAAP financial measures. Net DVA gains (losses) were $(31) million, $(90) million and $(179) million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. FICC net DVA gains (losses) were $(30) million, $(79) million and $(184) million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. Equities net DVA gains (losses) were $(1) million, $(11) million and $5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. C Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. See page 18 of this press release for reconciliation to GAAP financial measures. D Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, limited to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS, and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities, and are readily available to meet funding requirements as they arise. They do not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity among legal entities may be subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions. E Regulatory capital ratios at June 30, 2019 are preliminary. We report regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, which for CET1 is the Standardized approach at June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018. 10 Contact Information and Investor Conference Call Invitation Note: Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan and Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio will discuss second- quarter 2019 financial results in a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET today.

We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 18. (2) Ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. Charge-off ratios are annualized for the quarterly presentation. (3) Balances do not include past due consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and individually insured long-term stand-by agreements (fully insured home loans), and in general, other consumer and commercial loans not secured by real estate; purchased credit-impaired loans even though the customer may be contractually past due; and nonperforming loans held for sale or accounted for under the fair value option. (4) Regulatory capital ratios at June 30, 2019 are preliminary. Bank of America Corporation (the Corporation) reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, which for CET1 is the Standardized approach at June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018. (5) Tangible equity ratio equals period-end tangible shareholders’ equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible common equity ratio equals period-end tangible common shareholders’ equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible shareholders’ equity and tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures.

Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation’s use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. See the tables below for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely related financial measures defined by GAAP for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 and the three months ended June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in understanding its results of operations and trends. Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently.

It speaks only as of the particular date or dates included in the accompanying slides. Bank of America does not undertake an obligation to, and disclaims any duty to, update any of the information provided. • The Company may present certain key performance indicators and ratios, including year-over-year comparisons of revenue, noninterest expense and pretax income, excluding certain items (e.g., DVA) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in understanding its results of operations and trends. For more information about the non-GAAP financial measures contained herein, please see the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and accompanying reconciliations in the earnings press release for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 and other earnings-related information available through the Bank of America Investor Relations website at: http://investor.bankofamerica.com. • The Company views net interest income and related ratios and analyses on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes managing the business with net interest income on an FTE basis provides investors with a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. The Company believes that the presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. The FTE adjustment was $149MM, $153MM, $155MM, $151MM and $154MM for 2Q19, 1Q19, 4Q18, 3Q18 and 2Q18, respectively. • The Company allocates capital to its business segments using a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. The Company's internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. Allocated capital is reviewed periodically and refinements are made based on multiple considerations that include, but are not limited to, risk-weighted assets measured under Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches, business segment exposures and risk profile, and strategic plans. 28 -;-EX-99.3:EX-99.3 4 bac-6302019ex993.htm THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION Exhibit Supplemental Information Second Quarter 2019 Current period information is preliminary and based on company data available at the time of the earnings presentation.

We report regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy. (2) Tangible equity ratio equals period-end tangible shareholders’ equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible common equity ratio equals period-end tangible common shareholders’ equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible shareholders’ equity and tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.

(2) Consumer loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. Certain troubled debt restructurings are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower’s sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. (3) Our policy is not to classify consumer credit card and non-bankruptcy related consumer loans not secured by real estate as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and, accordingly, are excluded from this table. (4) Includes U.S. small business commercial activity. Small business card loans are excluded as they are not classified as nonperforming. (5) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection.

Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation’s use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. See the tables below for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely related financial measures defined by GAAP for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 and the three months ended June 30, 2019 , March 31, 2019 , December 31, 2018 , September 30, 2018 and June 30, 2018 . The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in understanding its results of operations and trends. Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently.

Our return on assets was over 120 basis points and our return on equity was well above the firm's cost of capital. ""Our view of the economy reflects the activity by the one-in-two American households we serve, which points to a steadily growing economy. We see solid consumer activity across the board, with spending by Bank of America consumers up five percent this quarter over the second quarter of last year. ""Our customers gave us more of their assets to handle for them. That includes an increase of $75 billion in deposits, with $37 billion from consumers. And customers gave us more of their investment dollar, as we reached $2.9 trillion in balances. This quarter, we also regained the leading U.S. market share in lending to the important small business economy. These customers continue to engage in solid activity to build their businesses. We also see consistent borrowing and activity from our commercial and corporate clients, who are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that arise as trade and other open issues are resolved. Importantly, we have seen improvement in our investment banking market share as we have repositioned that business.""

FTE basis is a performance measure used in operating the business that management believes provides investors a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. We believe that this presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $12.3 billion, $12.5 billion and $12.0 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. The FTE adjustment was $149 million, $153 million and $154 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. B Global Markets revenue and net income, excluding net debit valuation adjustments (DVA), and sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, are non- GAAP financial measures. Net DVA gains (losses) were $(31) million, $(90) million and $(179) million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively.

Equities net DVA gains (losses) were $(1) million, $(11) million and $5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. C Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. See page 18 of this press release for reconciliation to GAAP financial measures. D Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, limited to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS, and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities, and are readily available to meet funding requirements as they arise. They do not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity among legal entities may be subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions. E Regulatory capital ratios at June 30, 2019 are preliminary. We report regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, which for CET1 is the Standardized approach at June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018. 10 Contact Information and Investor Conference Call Invitation Note: Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan and Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio will discuss second- quarter 2019 financial results in a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET today.

We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 18. (2) Ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. Charge-off ratios are annualized for the quarterly presentation. (3) Balances do not include past due consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and individually insured long-term stand-by agreements (fully insured home loans), and in general, other consumer and commercial loans not secured by real estate; purchased credit-impaired loans even though the customer may be contractually past due; and nonperforming loans held for sale or accounted for under the fair value option. (4) Regulatory capital ratios at June 30, 2019 are preliminary. Bank of America Corporation (the Corporation) reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, which for CET1 is the Standardized approach at June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018. (5) Tangible equity ratio equals period-end tangible shareholders’ equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible common equity ratio equals period-end tangible common shareholders’ equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible shareholders’ equity and tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.

Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation’s use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. See the tables below for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely related financial measures defined by GAAP for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 and the three months ended June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018.

BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION By: /s/ Ross E. Jeffries, Jr. Ross E. Jeffries, Jr. Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary Dated: June 27, 2019 4 -;-EX-99.1:EX-99.1 2 bacexhibit991062719.htm EXHIBIT 99.1 Exhibit June 27, 2019 Bank of America Announces Planned Capital Distributions Quarterly Dividend to Increase 20 Percent $30.9 Billion In Share Buybacks Approved CHARLOTTE - Bank of America today announced that the Federal Reserve did not object to its capital plan following completion of the 2019 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review and that the company’s Board of Directors approved plans to increase capital returns to shareholders. “By driving Responsible Growth, we have generated record earnings and consistent returns that allow us to invest in our company, deliver solid returns to shareholders, and also address some of the world’s most pressing priorities,” said Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. “Today’s announcement includes a plan to prudently return a portion of our excess capital above what is needed for investments to grow the company.” The Board approved plans for the company to return as much as $37 billion to common stockholders over the next four quarters through an increased quarterly common stock dividend and common stock repurchases, based on the company’s current number of outstanding shares and share price. The company plans to increase by 20 percent its quarterly common stock dividend, to $0.18 per share, beginning in the third quarter of 2019. It has been authorized to repurchase approximately $30.9 billion in common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. The buybacks would include approximately $0.9 billion in repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the same period. Since the beginning of 2015, the company has earned $87 billion in net income and returned $62 billion to common stockholders. At the same time, other uses of capital previously announced by the company have included: • Helping to support the economy by increasing loans by $195 billion across our lines of business since the end of 2014, growing 6 percent on an annualized basis; • Sharing its success by awarding special bonuses to employees in each of the past two years, which covered more than 90 percent of its workforce and cost $1 billion; • Raising its minimum wage to $17 per hour in 2019 on the way to $20 per hour to be paid in 2021; • Increasing its investment in low-carbon business activities by mobilizing an additional $300 billion by 2030 to bring to $445 billion the company’s total commitment since 2007; the company has deployed more than $126 billion over the past 12 years in support of environmental business efforts across the globe; and • Committing $5 billion to an affordable homeownership initiative for low- to moderate-income and multicultural homebuyers and communities across the country. The repurchase program announced today will be subject to various factors, including the company’s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The common stock repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including Rule 10b5-1 plans.
