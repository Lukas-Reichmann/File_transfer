General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For several reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, the magnitude of gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. To varying degrees, our operating businesses have been impacted by government and private sector actions to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 virus and its variants as well as by the development of geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow inflation. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2. New accounting pronouncements We adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2018-12”) as of January 1, 2023, which modifies the accounting, reporting and disclosures related to long-duration insurance contracts, including the measurement of our long-duration life, annuity and health benefit liabilities. ASU 2018-12 was applied retrospectively to contracts in-force beginning as of January 1, 2021 (the “transition date”). As of the transition date, the after-tax impact of changes in cash flow assumptions were recorded in retained earnings and the after-tax effect of changes in discount rate assumptions were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 and as of the transition date were revised for the effects of adopting ASU 2018-12. These effects were included in Part II, Item 5 to our Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2023. A summary of the effects of adopting ASU 2018-12 on our periodic payment annuity and life and health insurance benefits liabilities as of the transition date follows (in millions). The reclassifications to other policyholder liabilities are primarily related to certain liabilities arising under our variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts. These liabilities are not classified as life, annuity and health insurance benefits liabilities under ASU 2018-12. Periodic payment annuities Life and health Total Balance at December 31, 2020, as previously reported $ 10,974 $ 10,642 $ 21,616 Reclassifications to other policyholder liabilities ( 286 ) ( 929 ) ( 1,215 ) Change in discount rate assumptions 6,553 1,447 8,000 Change in cash flow assumptions ( 117 ) 552 435 Balance as of January 1, 2021 $ 17,124 $ 11,712 $ 28,836 8 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2. New accounting pronouncements ( Continued) Beginning as of January 1, 2021, the cash flow assumptions used to measure benefit liabilities are reviewed at least annually, with the effects of assumption changes recorded in earnings. The discount rate assumptions used to measure benefit liabilities are revised each quarterly reporting period with the effects of changes reported in other comprehensive income. Discount rates are based on the prevailing upper-medium grade corporate bond yields (generally single A credit ratings) that reflect the duration characteristics and currency attributes of the liabilities. In measuring benefit liabilities and amortizing capitalized acquisition costs under long-duration insurance contracts, we generally aggregate contracts by issuance year. See Note 16 for other disclosures related to our long-duration insurance contracts. The effects of adopting ASU 2018-12 on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 follows in millions, except per share amounts.

ASU 2023-02 permits reporting entities to elect to account for tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Currently, the proportional amortization method is limited to certain affordable housing tax credit investments. ASU 2023-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and is applied either on a retrospective basis beginning as of the earliest period presented or a modified retrospective basis in the period of adoption. We are evaluating the effects this standard could have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 9 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3. Significant business acquisitions Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4 % interest in Pilot Travel Centers, LLC (“PTC”) for approximately $ 8.2 billion. We now possess a controlling interest in PTC for financial reporting purposes and began consolidating PTC’s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements on February 1, 2023. Since PTC’s most significant business activities involve purchasing and selling fuel (energy) on a wholesale and retail basis, and other energy-related businesses, we have included PTC within the railroad, utilities and energy sections of our Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Earnings beginning February 1, 2023. We previously owned a 38.6 % interest in PTC, which we accounted for under the equity method through the end of January 2023. PTC is headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee and operates travel centers in North America (primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J) with more than 750 travel center locations across 44 states and six Canadian provinces. PTC also operates large wholesale fuel and fuel marketing platforms in the U.S. and a water hauling and disposal business in the oil fields sector. PTC’s revenues and net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders included in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the eight months ending September 30, 2023 were $ 37.4 billion and $ 380 million, respectively. In applying the acquisition method of accounting, we were required to remeasure our previously held 38.6 % investment in PTC to fair value. In the first quarter of 2023, we recognized a one-time, non-cash remeasurement gain of approximately $ 3.0 billion, representing the excess of the fair value of that interest over the carrying value under the equity method, as a component of investment gains (losses). The holder of the remaining noncontrolling interests in PTC has the option to require us to redeem for cash, all or a portion of the interest beginning in 2024. The redemption price will be based on a multiple of PTC’s future earnings as adjusted per the terms of the option, with specified other adjustments for debt and cash. We concluded that the remaining PTC noncontrolling interests represent redeemable interests under GAAP and present such interests between liabilities and shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We valued the noncontrolling interests at fair value as of the acquisition date. Thereafter, we will increase or decrease the redeemable noncontrolling interest by the share of the earnings or losses attributable to the interest and will further increase the balance if the current estimated redemption price exceeds the carrying value. The preliminary values of PTC’s assets acquired, liabilities assumed and redeemable noncontrolling interests as of January 31, 2023 are summarized as follows (in millions). The acquisition date values of certain assets and liabilities have not been finalized and are provisional. Assets acquired Liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests Property, plant and equipment $ 8,189 Notes payable $ 5,876 Goodwill and other intangible assets 13,202 Other liabilities 4,774 Other assets 6,994 Liabilities assumed 10,650 Noncontrolling interests, predominantly redeemable 3,370 Assets acquired $ 28,385 Liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests $ 14,020 Net assets $ 14,365 On October 19, 2022 , Berkshire acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”) for $ 11.5 billion. Alleghany operates a group of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses. It also owns a portfolio of non-financial businesses. Goodwill arising from Berkshire’s acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. A summary of the values of the Alleghany assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of October 19, 2022 follows (in millions). Assets acquired Liabilities assumed Cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills $ 3,762 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 15,080 Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities 15,982 Unearned premiums 3,536 Loans and other receivables 5,650 Notes payable 2,169 Goodwill 3,900 Other liabilities 3,300 Other intangible assets 2,659 Other assets 3,637 Assets acquired $ 35,590 Liabilities assumed $ 24,085 Net assets $ 11,505 10 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3. Significant business acquisitions ( Continued) Certain unaudited pro forma revenue and consolidated earnings (loss) data for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as if the Alleghany and PTC acquisitions were consummated on the same terms at the beginning of 2022 follows (in millions, except per share amounts). September 30, 2022 Revenues $ 287,682 Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders ( 41,161 ) Net earnings (loss) per equivalent Class A common share ( 27,987 ) On September 1, 2023 , a Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) subsidiary acquired an additional 50 % limited partnership interest in Cove Point LNG, LP (“Cove Point”) for $ 3.3 billion, which increased our economic interest from 25 % to 75 %. Prior to the transaction, we also owned 100 % of the general partner interests. We previously treated Cove Point as a consolidated subsidiary for financial reporting purposes because we concluded we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect Cove Point, as well as the obligation to absorb losses and benefits that could be significant to Cove Point. Accordingly, the interest acquired in the third quarter was an acquisition of a noncontrolling interest. We recorded a charge at Berkshire’s ownership percentage of BHE of $ 667 million to capital in excess of par for the excess of the consideration paid over the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest acquired and deferred income tax assets arising from the transaction.

As of September 30, 2023, approximately 94 % of our foreign government holdings were rated AA or higher by at least one of the major rating agencies. The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities at September 30, 2023 are summarized below by contractual maturity dates (in millions). Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to prepayment rights held by issuers.

In 2019, we invested $ 10 billion in non-voting Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) and in Occidental common stock warrants. During 2022, we began acquiring common stock of Occidental. Our aggregate voting interest in Occidental common stock exceeded 20 % on August 4, 2022, and we adopted the equity method as of that date. See Note 6. Our investments in the Occidental preferred stock and Occidental common stock warrants are recorded at fair value and included as equity securities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as such investments are not in-substance common stock under GAAP and are not eligible for the equity method. The Occidental preferred stock accrues dividends at 8 % per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation value, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. As of September 30, 2023, our investment in Occidental preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation value of approximately $ 8.5 billion. During the first nine months of 2023, Occidental issued mandatory redemption notifications for approximately $ 1.5 billion of the aggregate liquidation value at a price of 110 % of the liquidation value, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The mandatory redemptions were due to excess distributions by Occidental to its common stockholders, as defined under the terms of Occidental preferred stock certificate of designations. The Occidental common stock warrants allow us to purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $ 59.62 per share. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the date the preferred stock is fully redeemed. On September 30, 2023, we owned 151.6 million shares of American Express Company (“American Express”) common stock representing 20.8 % of the outstanding common stock of American Express. Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors. We have also agreed to passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we do not use the equity method with respect to our investment in American Express common stock, and we continue to record our investment at fair value. 12 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 6. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these are our investments in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”) and Occidental. As of September 30, 2023, we owned 26.5 % of the outstanding Kraft Heinz common stock and 25.3 % of the outstanding Occidental common stock, which excludes the potential effect of the exercise of the Occidental common stock warrants. Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Occidental is an international energy company, whose activities include oil and natural gas exploration, development and production and chemicals manufacturing businesses. Occidental’s financial information is not available in time for concurrent reporting in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, we report the equity method effects for Occidental on a one-quarter lag. The common stock of Kraft Heinz and Occidental are publicly traded. The fair values and our carrying values of these investments in addition to the carrying values of our other significant equity method investments are summarized as follows (in millions). Carrying Value Fair Value September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Kraft Heinz $ 13,073 $ 12,937 $ 10,948 $ 13,249 Occidental 13,987 11,484 14,541 12,242 Other 436 3,629 $ 27,496 $ 28,050 We evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for other-than-temporary impairment as of September 30, 2023, and based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, concluded the recognition of an impairment charge in earnings was not required. Our other significant equity method investments included our 50 % interest in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), in which Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owns the other 50 % interest and PTC through January 31, 2023. Berkadia provides capital solutions, investment sales advisory and mortgage servicing for multifamily and commercial real estate. Berkadia’s commercial paper borrowing capacity (currently limited to $ 1.5 billion) is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. Beginning February 1, 2023, we ceased accounting for PTC under the equity method and began consolidating PTC for financial reporting purposes. Our investment in PTC under the equity method was $ 3.2 billion at December 31, 2022. Equity method earnings attributable to PTC were $ 105 million for the month ending January 31, 2023, $ 275 million for the third quarter of 2022 and $ 477 million for the first nine months of 2022. The carrying values of our investments in Kraft Heinz and Berkadia approximate our share of the net equity of each of these entities. The carrying value of our investment in Occidental common stock exceeded our share of its shareholders’ equity as of June 30, 2023 by approximately $ 8.8 billion. Based upon the limited information available to us, we concluded the excess represents goodwill. As previously indicated, we are reporting the equity method results for Occidental on a one-quarter lag. Thus, the earnings we recorded in 2023 related to Occidental’s earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 and first six months of 2023. Our earnings and distributions received from equity method investments are summarized in the following table (in millions).

In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the period represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable period or, if later, the purchase date. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $ 32.8 billion in the first nine months of 2023 and $ 17.3 billion in the first nine months of 2022. Taxable gains and losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Equity securities sold produced taxable gains of $ 759 million in the third quarter and $ 5.4 billion in the first nine months of 2023 compared to taxable gains of $ 3 million in the third quarter and taxable losses of $ 660 million in the first nine months of 2022. Other investment gains in the first nine months of 2023 included approximately $ 3.0 billion from the remeasurement of our pre-existing 38.6 % interest in PTC through the application of acquisition accounting under GAAP. 14 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 8.

The decline in loan balances during the first nine months of 2023 was attributable to prepayments and dispositions. Our commercial loans are generally secured by real estate properties or by other assets. Note 9. Other receivables Other receivables are comprised of the following (in millions). Receivables of the railroad, utilities and energy businesses at September 30, 2023 included approximately $ 2.0 billion related to PTC.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Reconciliations of the changes in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”), excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 15), for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 follows (in millions). 2023 2022 Balances at beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 107,472 $ 86,664 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 5,025 ) ( 2,960 ) Net liabilities 102,447 83,704 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year 44,537 44,472 Prior accident years ( 3,126 ) ( 2,141 ) Total 41,411 42,331 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year ( 16,962 ) ( 17,543 ) Prior accident years ( 22,171 ) ( 18,564 ) Total ( 39,133 ) ( 36,107 ) Foreign currency effect 68 ( 1,044 ) Balances at September 30: Net liabilities 104,793 88,884 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 5,031 2,758 Gross liabilities $ 109,824 $ 91,642 Our claim liabilities under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. Current accident year incurred losses in the first nine months from significant catastrophe events (losses in excess of $ 150 million per event) were approximately $ 590 million in 2023 from a cyclone and floods in New Zealand in the first quarter and $ 3.9 billion in 2022, primarily from Hurricane Ian in the third quarter. In the first nine months, we recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 3.1 billion in 2023 and $ 2.1 billion in 2022, which reduced incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 3.1 % in 2023 and 2.6 % in 2022. We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of primary insurance businesses in the first nine months by $ 1.6 billion in 2023 and $ 734 million in 2022. In 2023, the reductions were driven by private passenger auto claims, whereas the decreases in 2022 reflected reductions of liabilities for private passenger auto, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims. In the first nine months, estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of property and casualty reinsurance businesses were reduced $ 1.5 billion in 2023 and $ 1.4 billion in 2022. Note 15. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 follow (in millions). 2023 2022 Balances at beginning of year $ 35,415 $ 37,855 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 13 ( 23 ) Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 1,471 ) ( 1,567 ) Foreign currency effect ( 38 ) ( 289 ) Balances at September 30 $ 33,919 $ 35,976 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 13 $ ( 23 ) Deferred charge amortization and adjustments 605 649 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings $ 618 $ 626 18 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15. Retroactive reinsurance contracts (Continued) In the preceding table, incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses related to contracts incepting in prior years. Claims payments under our contracts may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include changes in estimated liabilities and related deferred charge asset amortization and adjustments arising from the changes in the estimated timing and amount of future loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $ 9.3 billion at September 30, 2023 and $ 9.9 billion at December 31, 2022. Note 16. Long-duration insurance contracts We write periodic payment annuity and life and health insurance contracts, which are considered long-duration insurance contracts under GAAP. Our life, annuity and health insurance benefits liabilities as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, disaggregated for our two primary product categories, periodic payment annuities and life and health insurance, were as follows (in millions). Other liabilities primarily consist of incurred-but-not-reported claims and claims in the course of settlement.

These liabilities are included in other policyholder liabilities and are measured at estimated fair value. Such liabilities were approximately $ 895 million as of September 30, 2023 and $ 1.25 billion as of December 31, 2022. During the first nine months of 2023, we reduced liability estimates by $ 316 million, for the effects of changes in securities markets, interest rates and other inputs. Note 17. Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings of our insurance and other businesses are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges are based on borrowings as of September 30, 2023.

Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) In the first nine months of 2023, Berkshire repaid approximately $ 4.3 billion of maturing senior notes. In April 2023, Berkshire issued ¥ 164.4 billion (approximately $ 1.2 billion) of senior notes. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. Berkshire also guarantees certain debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $ 2.7 billion at September 30, 2023. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 6.85 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 1,137 billion par at September 30, 2023) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates produced pre-tax gains of $ 582 million in the third quarter and $ 1.1 billion in the first nine months of 2023 as compared to pre-tax gains of $ 1.2 billion in the third quarter and $ 3.3 billion in the first nine months of 2022. Notes payable and other borrowings of our railroad, utilities and energy businesses are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges are based on borrowings as of September 30, 2023. Weighted Average Interest Rate September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2023 - 2053 4.4 % $ 13,600 $ 13,996 Subsidiary and other debt due 2023 - 2064 4.4 % 39,119 37,639 Short-term borrowings 5.9 % 1,617 1,119 Pilot Travel Centers (“PTC”) and subsidiaries due 2023 - 2028 7.2 % 5,999 — Burlington Northern Santa Fe (“BNSF”) and subsidiaries due 2023 - 2097 4.6 % 23,505 23,452 $ 83,840 $ 76,206 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In the first nine months of 2023, BHE subsidiaries issued $ 3.5 billion of term debt ($ 2.3 billion in the third quarter) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.7 % and maturity dates ranging from 2034 to 2054 . During the first nine months of 2023, BHE and its subsidiaries repaid approximately $ 2.3 billion of term debt. PTC’s borrowings primarily represent secured syndicated loans. BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. During the first nine months of 2023, BNSF issued $ 1.6 billion of 5.2 % debentures due in 2054 and repaid approximately $ 1.5 billion of term debt. As of September 30, 2023, BHE, BNSF and PTC and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BHE, BNSF, PTC or their subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries have unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $ 12.4 billion at September 30, 2023, which included approximately $ 9.3 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 21 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 18. Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, other receivables and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of or otherwise approximate the fair values.

Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 follow (in millions).

These investments are private placements with contractual terms that restrict transfers and currently prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of liquidity and subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility. Note 19. Common stock Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the first nine months of 2023 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Class A, $ 5 Par Value ( 1,650,000 shares authorized) Class B, $ 0.0033 Par Value ( 3,225,000,000 shares authorized) Issued Treasury Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding Balances at December 31, 2022 651,450 ( 59,886 ) 591,564 1,509,969,352 ( 207,715,276 ) 1,302,254,076 Conversions of Class A to Class B common stock ( 10,185 ) — ( 10,185 ) 15,277,500 — 15,277,500 Treasury stock acquired — ( 8,044 ) ( 8,044 ) — ( 9,214,983 ) ( 9,214,983 ) Balances at September 30, 2023 641,265 ( 67,930 ) 573,335 1,525,246,852 ( 216,930,259 ) 1,308,316,593 23 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19. Common stock (Continued) Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,445,546 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and 1,459,733 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth ( 1/1,500 ) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth ( 1/1,500 ) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times the average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $ 30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note 20. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were 25.9 % in the third quarter and 18.9 % in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 36.6 % in the third quarter and 23.5 % in the first nine months of 2022. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in certain equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, including realized and unrealized investment gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions, and enacted changes thereto.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. Generally, we do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. PacifiCorp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire’s 92 % owned subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), operates as a regulated electric utility in Oregon and other Western states. In September 2020, a severe weather event resulting in high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures, contributed to several major wildfires (the “2020 Wildfires”), which resulted in real and personal property and natural resource damage, personal injuries and loss of life and widespread power outages in Oregon and Northern California. The wildfires spread across certain parts of PacifiCorp’s service territory and surrounding areas across multiple counties in Oregon and California, including Siskiyou County, California; Jackson County, Oregon; Douglas County, Oregon; Marion County, Oregon; Lincoln County, Oregon; and Klamath County, Oregon, burning over 500,000 acres in aggregate. Third-party reports for these wildfires indicate over 2,000 structures destroyed, including residences; several structures damaged; multiple individuals injured; and several fatalities. On July 29, 2022, the 2022 McKinney Fire began in the Oak Knoll Ranger District of the Klamath National Forest in Siskiyou County, California located in PacifiCorp’s service territory (the “2022 Wildfire”). Third-party reports indicate that the 2022 Wildfire resulted in 11 structures damaged, 185 structures destroyed, 12 injuries and four fatalities and consumed 60,000 acres in aggregate. The 2020 Wildfires and 2022 Wildfire, together, are referred to as the “Wildfires”. Investigations into the cause and origin of each of the Wildfires are complex and ongoing and have been or are being conducted by various entities, including the U.S. Forest Service, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Department of Forestry, the Oregon Department of Justice, PacifiCorp and various experts engaged by PacifiCorp. Numerous lawsuits on behalf of plaintiffs related to the 2020 Wildfires have been filed in Oregon and California, including a class action complaint against PacifiCorp that was filed in 2020, captioned Jeanyne James et al. v. PacifiCorp et al., in Multnomah County Circuit Court, Oregon (the “James case”). The plaintiffs seek damages for economic losses, non-economic losses, including mental suffering, emotional distress, personal injury and loss of life, punitive damages, other damages and attorneys’ fees. Amounts sought in the lawsuits, complaints and demands filed in Oregon total nearly $ 8 billion, excluding any doubling or trebling of damages included in the complaints. Generally, the complaints filed in California do not specify damages sought and are not included in this amount. Final determinations of liability will only be made following the completion of comprehensive investigations, litigation and similar processes. Multiple lawsuits have also been filed in California on behalf of plaintiffs related to the 2022 Wildfire. The plaintiffs seek damages for economic losses, non-economic losses, including mental suffering, emotional distress, personal injury and loss of life, punitive damages, other damages and attorneys’ fees, but the amount of damages sought is not specified. Several insurance carriers have filed subrogation complaints in Oregon and California with allegations similar to those made in the aforementioned lawsuits. Additionally, certain governmental agencies have informed PacifiCorp that they are contemplating filing actions in connection with certain of the Oregon 2020 Wildfires. In June 2023, a jury issued its verdict for the 17 named plaintiffs in the James case finding PacifiCorp liable to the 17 individual plaintiffs and to the class with respect to the four 2020 Wildfires. The jury awarded the 17 named plaintiffs $ 90 million of damages, including $ 4 million of economic and property damages, $ 68 million of non-economic damages and $ 18 million of punitive damages based on a 0.25 multiplier of the economic and non-economic damages. 25 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 23. Contingencies and commitments (Continued) In September 2023, the Multnomah County Circuit Court ordered trial dates for two consolidated jury trials including approximately 10 class members each and a third trial for certain commercial timber plaintiffs wherein plaintiffs in each of the three trials will present evidence regarding their damages. The trials are scheduled at various dates from January to April 2024. A fourth jury trial is scheduled in May 2024 relating to certain non-class plaintiffs associated with one of the 2020 Wildfires. Hearings on PacifiCorp’s post-trial motions are scheduled to be held November 9, 2023. Under Oregon Revised Statute 82.010, interest at a rate of 9% per annum will accrue on the judgment commencing at the date the judgment is entered unless otherwise specified in the judgment. No judgment has yet been entered by the Multnomah County Circuit Court. PacifiCorp intends to appeal the jury’s findings and damage awards in the James case, including whether the case can proceed as a class action. The appeals process and further actions could take several years. A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. PacifiCorp evaluates the related range of reasonably estimated losses and records a loss based on its best estimate within that range or the lower end of the range if there is no better estimate. Estimated probable losses associated with the Wildfires were based on the information available to the date of this filing, including (i) ongoing cause and origin investigations; (ii) ongoing settlement and mediation discussions; (iii) other litigation matters and upcoming legal proceedings; and (iv) the status of the James case. Wildfire estimated losses include estimates for fire suppression costs, real and personal property damages, natural resource damages for certain areas and non-economic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages that are considered probable of being incurred and that it is able to reasonably estimate at this time and which is subject to change as additional relevant information becomes available. PacifiCorp increased its liability for estimated pre-tax probable Wildfire losses, before expected related insurance recoveries, by $ 1.4 billion in the third quarter and by $ 1.9 billion in the first nine months of 2023. Expected probable Wildfire losses, net of expected insurance recoveries, were approximately $ 1.3 billion in the third quarter and $ 1.7 billion in the first nine months of 2023. Such amounts were included in energy operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. PacifiCorp’s cumulative charges to date for estimated probable Wildfire losses were $ 2.4 billion through September 30, 2023. It is reasonably possible PacifiCorp will incur significant additional Wildfire losses beyond the amounts currently accrued; however, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible additional losses that could be incurred due to the number of properties and parties involved, including claimants in the class to the James case, the variation in those types of properties and lack of available details and the ultimate outcome of legal actions. HomeServices of America, Inc. (“HomeServices”), a wholly owned subsidiary of BHE, is currently defending against four antitrust cases, all in federal district courts. In each case, plaintiffs claim HomeServices and certain of its subsidiaries conspired with co-defendants to artificially inflate real estate commissions by following and enforcing multiple listing service (“MLS”) rules that require listing agents to offer a commission split to cooperating agents in order for the property to appear on the MLS (“Cooperative Compensation Rule”). None of the complaints specify damages sought. In one of these cases, a jury trial commenced on October 16, 2023, and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs on October 31, 2023, finding that the named defendants participated in a conspiracy to follow and enforce the Cooperative Compensation Rule, which had the purpose or effect of raising, inflating, or stabilizing broker commission rates paid by home sellers. The jury further found that the class plaintiffs had proved damages in the amount of $ 1.8 billion. Federal law authorized trebling of damages and the award of pre-judgment interest and attorney fees. Joint and several liability applies for the co-defendants. HomeServices intends to vigorously appeal on multiple grounds the jury’s findings and damage award. The appeals process and further actions could take several years. While it is likely that HomeServices may incur a loss, HomeServices is currently unable to reasonably estimate such loss due to, among other reasons, the joint and several nature of the liability and the early state of the appeals process. It is also reasonably possible that HomeServices will incur losses from the three other antitrust cases. However, HomeServices is unable to reasonably estimate a specific range of possible losses that could be incurred due to, among other reasons, lack of information about the size of the plaintiff class and potential damages, as well as the joint and several nature of potential liability of the defendants. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that liabilities that may arise as a result of such other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 26 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 24.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines and marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. We acquired control of Pilot Travel Centers (“PTC”) on January 31, 2023 and PTC is considered a reportable segment beginning February 1, 2023. In this presentation, the revenues and pre-tax earnings of the PTC segment are for the eight months ending September 30, 2023. Previously, our earnings from PTC were determined under the equity method and are included in earnings from equity method investments. Revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes by segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions).

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. To varying degrees, our operating businesses have been impacted by government and private sector actions taken to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 virus and its variants as well as by the development of global geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow inflation. We cannot reliably predict the future economic effects of these events on our businesses. Insurance underwriting generated earnings of $2.4 billion in the third quarter and $4.6 billion in the first nine months of 2023 versus losses of $1.1 billion in the third quarter and $190 million in the first nine months of 2022. Earnings in 2023 benefited from relatively low catastrophe losses, while earnings in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 included after-tax incurred losses of approximately $2.7 billion attributable to Hurricane Ian. Underwriting earnings in 2023 also reflected improved results at GEICO. The retrospective adoption of ASU 2018-12 increased insurance underwriting losses $110 million in the third quarter of 2022 and reduced underwriting losses $144 million in the first nine months of 2022 from the previously reported amounts. Earnings from insurance investment income increased $1.1 billion in the third quarter and $2.3 billion in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increases were primarily due to the impact of higher short-term interest rates, partly offset by lower dividend income. Earnings of BNSF declined 15.3% in the third quarter and 16.6% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The decreases were primarily attributable to lower overall freight volumes and higher non-fuel operating costs, partially offset by lower fuel costs. After-tax earnings of BHE declined 68.9% in the third quarter and 46.3% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings decline in the first nine months reflected lower earnings from the U.S. regulated utilities, reflecting increased wildfire loss estimates, as well as lower earnings from other energy businesses and real estate brokerage businesses. As disclosed in Note 3 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, we increased our ownership in PTC from 38.6% to 80% on January 31, 2023 and we began consolidating PTC’s results of operations on February 1, 2023. In 2022 and through January 31, 2023, our share of earnings from PTC on our 38.6% interest was determined under the equity method and is included in earnings from non-controlled businesses in the preceding table. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 2.9% in the third quarter and 2.0% in the first nine months of 2023 versus 2022. While results of certain industrial products manufacturers and services businesses improved versus 2022, results of several of our building products, consumer products, service and retailing businesses deteriorated. Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) in each period of 2023 and 2022 predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment gains and losses on investments in equity securities, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) also included an after-tax non-cash remeasurement gain of approximately $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023 related to our previously held 38.6% interest in PTC through the application of the acquisition accounting method. 30 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (Continued) Other earnings included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of $447 million in the third quarter and $895 million in the first nine months of 2023 and $858 million in the third quarter and $2.4 billion in the first nine months of 2022. These gains related to the non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance business as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett, and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate the economic performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the quarterly or annual operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. We currently consider pre-tax incurred losses exceeding $150 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in 2023 were a cyclone and floods in New Zealand in the first quarter. In 2022, significant events were Hurricane Ian in the third quarter and floods in Australia in the first six months. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $143.7 billion as of September 30, 2023. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S.-based subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). Berkshire acquired Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”) on October 19, 2022. Alleghany operates a property and casualty insurance business through its subsidiaries, RSUI Group Inc. and CapSpecialty, Inc. (“RSUI and CapSpecialty” or “Alleghany Insurance”), and a reinsurance business through Transatlantic Reinsurance Company and affiliates (“TransRe Group”). Underwriting results of Alleghany Insurance are included in BH Primary and underwriting results of TransRe Group are included in BHRG. We strive to produce pre-tax underwriting earnings (premiums earned less insurance losses/benefits incurred and underwriting expenses) over the long term in all business categories, except for BHRG’s retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts businesses. Time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing prices for policies written by these businesses. We normally receive all premiums at the contract inception date, which are immediately available for investment. Ultimate claim payments can extend for decades and are expected to exceed premiums, producing underwriting losses over the claim settlement periods, primarily through deferred charge asset amortization and discounted liability accretion charges. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). The retrospective adoption of ASU 2018-12 increased BHRG’s pre-tax underwriting losses $141 million in the third quarter and increased pre-tax underwriting earnings $178 million in the first nine months of 2022 from the amounts previously reported.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO GEICO primarily writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. GEICO also operates an insurance agency that offers primarily homeowners and renters insurance to its auto policyholders. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2023 2022 2023 2022 Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 10,420 $ 10,137 $ 29,929 $ 29,818 Premiums earned $ 9,844 100.0 $ 9,808 100.0 $ 29,184 100.0 $ 29,169 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 7,879 80.0 9,515 97.0 24,063 82.5 27,164 93.1 Underwriting expenses 912 9.3 1,052 10.7 2,851 9.7 3,429 11.8 Total losses and expenses 8,791 89.3 10,567 107.7 26,914 92.2 30,593 104.9 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ 1,053 $ (759 ) $ 2,270 $ (1,424 ) GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first nine months of 2023 reflected higher average premiums per auto policy, lower claims frequencies, reductions in prior accident years’ claims estimates and a reduction in advertising costs. However, average claims severities continued to rise in 2023. Premiums written increased $283 million (2.8%) in the third quarter and were substantially unchanged in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. Premiums written in 2023 reflected rate increases during the past 12 months that produced higher average premiums per auto policy (16.8%) and a 2.3 million decrease (12.7%) in policies-in-force over that period. GEICO significantly reduced advertising in 2023 and 2022 which contributed to the reduction in policies-in-force. Premiums earned were substantially unchanged in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. Losses and loss adjustment expenses declined $1.6 billion (17.2%) in the third quarter and $3.1 billion (11.4%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. GEICO’s loss ratio (losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned) was 80.0% in the third quarter and 82.5% in the first nine months of 2023, decreases of 17.0 percentage points and 10.6 percentage points, respectively, compared to 2022. The loss ratio declines reflected the impact of higher average premiums per auto policy, increased favorable development of prior accident years’ claims estimates and lower claims frequencies, partially offset by increases in average claims severities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first nine months included reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior accident years’ claims of $1.2 billion in 2023 compared to $386 million in 2022. The reductions in 2023 and 2022 reflected decreased estimates across several coverages, partially offset by an increase in property damage coverage in 2022. Claims frequencies in the first nine months of 2023 were lower for property damage and collision coverages (seven to eight percent range), while claims frequencies increased for bodily injury coverage (two to three percent range). Average claims severities in the first nine months of 2023 were higher for property damage (seventeen to nineteen percent range), collision (five to seven percent range) and bodily injury (six to eight percent range) coverages. Underwriting expenses decreased $140 million (13.3%) in the third quarter and $578 million (16.9%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 9.3% in the third quarter and 9.7% in the first nine months of 2023, decreases of 1.4 percentage points and 2.1 percentage points, respectively, compared to 2022. The decreases in the expense ratios reflected the impact of increased rates and a 54% reduction in year-to-date advertising expenses incurred. The earnings from GEICO’s insurance agency (third party commissions net of operating expenses) are included as a reduction of underwriting expenses in the table above. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group consists of several independently managed businesses that provide a variety of primarily commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary’s insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”), Berkshire Hathaway Direct Insurance Company (“BH Direct”) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”). This group also includes RSUI and CapSpecialty beginning October 19, 2022. 32 Item 2.

Third Quarter First Nine Months 2023 2022 2023 2022 Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 4,990 $ 3,895 $ 13,905 $ 10,791 Premiums earned $ 4,449 100.0 $ 3,485 100.0 $ 12,643 100.0 $ 9,916 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 2,733 61.4 2,825 81.1 8,250 65.3 7,342 74.0 Underwriting expenses 1,206 27.1 941 27.0 3,343 26.4 2,521 25.5 Total losses and expenses 3,939 88.5 3,766 108.1 11,593 91.7 9,863 99.5 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ 510 $ (281 ) $ 1,050 $ 53 Premiums written increased $1.1 billion (28.1%) in the third quarter and $3.1 billion (28.9%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increases were primarily due to the inclusion of RSUI and CapSpecialty ($610 million in the third quarter and $1.9 billion in the first nine months), as well as comparative increases from several BH Primary insurers, led by BH Specialty and BH Direct. Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $92 million (3.3%) in the third quarter and increased $908 million (12.4%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The loss ratio decreased 19.7 percentage points in the third quarter and 8.7 percentage points in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting lower incurred losses from current year catastrophes and changes in business mix, including the impact of RSUI and CapSpecialty. Incurred losses from significant catastrophes occurring in the first nine months were $35 million in 2023 and $740 million in 2022, including $660 million in the third quarter from Hurricane Ian. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first nine months also reflected net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years’ claims of $396 million in 2023 and $348 million in 2022. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of workers’ compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Ultimate claims liabilities could be greater than anticipated due to a variety of factors, including from adverse legal and judicial rulings. Underwriting expenses increased $265 million (28.2%) in the third quarter and $822 million (32.6%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in the expense ratio in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily attributable to changes in business mix, including the effects of RSUI and CapSpecialty. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and, beginning October 19, 2022, TransRe Group. We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO and we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (in millions). The retrospective adoption of ASU 2018-12 increased pre-tax underwriting losses $141 million in the third quarter and increased pre-tax underwriting earnings $178 million in the first nine months of 2022 from the previously reported amounts. These revisions were primarily attributable to reductions in certain variable annuity guarantee liabilities and foreign currency exchange effects on periodic payment annuity liabilities.

Otherwise, premiums written in the first nine months of 2023 increased $497 million (3.8%) compared to 2022. We have written considerable levels of property business in recent years and we generally do not retrocede the risks we assume. Consequently, our periodic underwriting earnings are subject to considerable volatility from significant catastrophe loss events. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were $2.9 billion in the third quarter and $9.1 billion in the first nine months of 2023, and included $881 million and $2.4 billion, respectively, from TransRe Group. Excluding TransRe Group, losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $1.4 billion (41.0%) in the third quarter and $1.1 billion (14.0%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. Losses incurred from significant catastrophes in the first nine months were $552 million in 2023 and $2.5 billion in 2022, including $1.9 billion in the third quarter primarily from Hurricane Ian. Reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior accident years were $1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2023 and $1.4 billion in the first nine months of 2022. Overall, the loss ratio decreased 15.4 percentage points in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. Underwriting expenses in 2023 increased $794 million in the third quarter and $2.4 billion in the first nine months compared to 2022. The expense ratio increased 9.9 percentage points in the third quarter and 9.7 percentage points in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increases were primarily attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to the remeasurement of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries and changes in business mix, including the impact of TransRe Group. Underwriting expenses included foreign currency exchange gains of $114 million in the third quarter and losses of $78 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to gains of $315 million in the third quarter and $704 million in the first nine months of 2022. Underwriting expenses included $452 million in the third quarter and $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2023 from TransRe Group.

In the first quarter of 2023, several U.S. life reinsurance contracts were commuted, which reduced premiums earned by $161 million and life reinsurance benefits incurred by $304 million. Excluding these effects, premiums earned increased 1.9% in the first nine months of 2023, and life reinsurance benefits incurred increased 2.1% in the first nine months of 2023 versus 2022. The 1.3 percentage point increase in the underwriting expense ratio in the first nine months of 2023 versus 2022 was primarily attributable to the impact of the life reinsurance contract commutations and increased underwriting expenses. 34 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance Pre-tax underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance in each period derived from the amortization of deferred charges and the effects of changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax foreign currency exchange gains were $38 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to $289 million in the first nine months of 2022. Before foreign currency exchange effects, pre-tax underwriting losses were $622 million in the first nine months of 2023 and $614 million in 2022. Unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $33.9 billion at September 30, 2023, a decline of $1.5 billion since December 31, 2022, primarily attributable to claim payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $9.3 billion at September 30, 2023, a decline of $605 million since December 31, 2022. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity business is price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, as well as the level of competition. Beginning in the latter part of 2022, prices for new business have declined to unacceptable levels and we have since restricted writing new business. Our periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses from the recurring accretion of time-value discounted liabilities, which includes liabilities for contracts without life contingencies. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency exchange gains of $56 million in the third quarter and losses of $27 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to gains of $18 million in the third quarter and $127 million in the first nine months of 2022. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $147 million in the third quarter and $439 million in the first nine months of 2023 and $272 million in the third quarter and $554 million in the first nine months of 2022. Pre-tax losses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 included approximately $130 million attributable to an agreement to terminate an existing reinsurance contract, in which the settlement payable exceeded the carrying value of the liabilities. Discounted liabilities were $13.9 billion at September 30, 2023, which included $4.0 billion for contracts without life contingencies. We adopted ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023, which requires that the discount rates on contracts with life-contingent liabilities be adjusted quarterly based upon prevailing interest rates with the effects of discount rate changes included in other comprehensive income. Variable annuity Our variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax gains of $116 million in the third quarter and $309 million in the first nine months of 2023 and $45 million in the third quarter and $423 million in the first nine months of 2022. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile. Our estimated liabilities associated with these contracts, which are in run-off, were $895 million as of September 30, 2023. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Dividend income declined 4.5% in the third quarter and 12.0% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. These reductions reflected net dispositions of investments since the end of the third quarter of 2022. Income in the first nine months included $25 million in 2023 and $37 million in 2022 from BHE preferred stock. Such amounts were deducted from earnings of the BHE segment. Dividend income varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Interest and other investment income increased $1.3 billion in the third quarter and $3.5 billion in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increases were primarily due to increases in short-term interest rates. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills and other investments with relatively short maturities. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. The effect of discount rate changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for long-duration insurance contracts are excluded from float, as such amounts are not included in underwriting earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Float was approximately $167 billion at September 30, 2023 and $164 billion at December 31, 2022. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting gains in the first nine months of 2023 and, consequently, the average cost of float was negative. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 follows (in millions).

Cars/Units Percentage Change Third Quarter First Nine Months Third First Nine 2023 2022 2023 2022 Quarter Months Consumer products 1,236 1,323 3,459 3,977 (6.6 )% (13.0 )% Industrial products 416 413 1,212 1,237 0.7 (2.0 ) Agricultural products 268 276 846 884 (2.9 ) (4.3 ) Coal 376 399 1,105 1,158 (5.8 ) (4.6 ) 2,296 2,411 6,622 7,256 (4.8 ) (8.7 ) Railroad operating revenues declined 12.4% in the third quarter and 7.7% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting lower volumes of 4.8% in the third quarter and 8.7% in the first nine months. Average revenue per car/unit decreased 7.1% in the third quarter due to decreased rates per car/unit and lower fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by favorable changes in business mix. Average revenue per car/unit increased 1.6% in the first nine months of 2023, resulting from higher yield. BNSF’s pre-tax earnings were $1.6 billion in the third quarter and $4.9 billion in the first nine months of 2023, declines of 14.6% and 16.6%, respectively, compared to 2022. Operating revenues from consumer products were $2.0 billion in the third quarter and $5.7 billion in the first nine months of 2023, decreases of 18.0% and 17.4%, respectively, from 2022. The revenue declines were attributable to volume decreases of 6.6% in the third quarter and 13.0% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022 and lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were primarily due to lower intermodal shipments resulting from reduced west coast imports, the loss of an intermodal customer and competition from lower spot rates in the trucking market, which has impacted our domestic intermodal demand. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in automotive volume from higher vehicle production. Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.5 billion in the third quarter and $4.3 billion in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 0.7% and an increase of 1.5%, respectively, from 2022. The decline in the third quarter was due to lower revenue per car/unit, partially offset by 0.7% volume growth, primarily due to increased demand for construction products from infrastructure demand, partially offset by lower demand for plastics, chemicals and sand. The increase in the first nine months was primarily due to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a 2.0% volume decline. The volume decline was primarily due to lower demand for plastics, chemicals and lumber, partially offset by gains in construction products from infrastructure demand. 37 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BNSF (Continued) Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.2 billion in the third quarter and $4.0 billion in the first nine months of 2023, decreases of 8.7% in the third quarter and 2.3% in the first nine months compared to 2022. The third quarter revenue decline was attributable to lower average revenue per car/unit and a volume decline of 2.9%. The revenue decline in the first nine months was primarily due to a volume decrease of 4.3%, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were mainly due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of domestic grains, renewable diesel, feedstocks and oilseeds and meals. Operating revenues from coal were $932 million in the third quarter and $2.9 billion in the first nine months of 2023, decreases of 15.3% in the third quarter and 3.1% in the first nine months versus 2022. The revenue decline in the third quarter was attributable to lower volumes of 5.8% and lower average revenue per car/unit. The revenue decrease in the first nine months was driven by reduced volumes of 4.6%, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases derived from moderating demand attributable to lower natural gas prices and weather-related impacts. Railroad operating expenses were $3.9 billion in the third quarter and $11.8 billion in the first nine months of 2023, decreases of $512 million (11.6%) in the third quarter and $406 million (3.3%) in the first nine months compared to 2022. The decline in the third quarter reflected lower fuel costs and lower compensation and benefits expenses. The decrease during the first nine months was primarily attributable to a decrease in fuel costs, partially offset by increases in compensation and benefits expenses and equipment rents, materials and other expenses. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 0.7 percentage points to 68.4% in the third quarter and 3.1 percentage points to 68.3% in the first nine months of 2023 versus the comparable 2022 periods. Fuel expenses decreased $409 million (32.2%) in the third quarter and $749 million (22.0%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved efficiency. Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $87 million (5.9%) in the third quarter and increased $167 million (4.3%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The comparative decline in the third quarter was primarily due to the impact of retroactive wage increases in the third quarter of 2022 relating to the ratified union labor agreements. The changes in compensation and benefits expenses in both periods also reflect increased headcount, wage inflation and lower productivity in 2023. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses decreased $11 million (2.2%) in the third quarter and increased $136 million (9.1%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increase during the first nine months of 2023 was primarily due to general inflation, increased casualty and litigation costs, higher property and other taxes and lower gains from land and easement sales. Purchased services expenses decreased $27 million (5.1%) in the third quarter and $35 million (2.3%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a reduction in drayage costs, partially offset by general inflation.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BHE (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are largely based on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2023 2022 2023 2022 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 5,958 $ 6,095 $ 16,362 $ 15,858 Real estate operating revenue 1,212 1,405 3,383 4,284 Other income (loss) 111 57 349 (20 ) Total revenue 7,281 7,557 20,094 20,122 Costs and expenses: Energy cost of sales 2,009 1,959 5,530 4,944 Energy operating expenses 3,671 2,362 8,818 6,858 Real estate operating costs and expenses 1,181 1,352 3,351 4,086 Interest expense 567 537 1,695 1,583 Total costs and expenses 7,428 6,210 19,394 17,471 Pre-tax earnings (loss) (147 ) 1,347 700 2,651 Income tax benefit* (783 ) (561 ) (1,525 ) (1,254 ) Net earnings after income taxes 636 1,908 2,225 3,905 Noncontrolling interests of BHE subsidiaries 77 147 321 376 Net earnings attributable to BHE 559 1,761 1,904 3,529 Noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends 61 160 205 364 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 498 $ 1,601 $ 1,699 $ 3,165 Effective income tax rate ** (41.6 )% (217.9 )% (47.3 )% —————— * Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation. ** Not meaningful. The discussion of BHE’s operating results that follows is based on after-tax earnings, reflecting how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated. A summary of net earnings attributable to BHE follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months Percentage Change 2023 2022 2023 2022 Third Quarter First Nine Months U.S. utilities $ (53 ) $ 979 $ 540 $ 1,759 (105.4 )% (69.3 )% Natural gas pipelines 175 234 731 755 (25.2 ) (3.2 ) Other energy businesses 296 361 868 1,111 (18.0 ) (21.9 ) Real estate brokerage 25 29 25 134 (13.8 ) (81.3 ) Corporate interest and other 116 158 (260 ) (230 ) (26.6 ) (13.0 ) $ 559 $ 1,761 $ 1,904 $ 3,529 (68.3 ) (46.0 ) Our U.S. utilities operate independently in several states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming (PacifiCorp), Iowa and Illinois (MEC) and Nevada (NV Energy). After-tax earnings decreased $1.0 billion in the third quarter and $1.2 billion (69.3%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The declines reflected increases in energy operating expenses, including increases in estimated pre-tax loss accruals by PacifiCorp for the Wildfires, net of expected insurance recoveries, of $1.3 billion in the third quarter and $1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2023. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Wildfires. The declines in earnings also reflected higher interest expense and lower electric utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales). These items were partially offset by increases in interest and other income and lower depreciation and amortization expense. The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $2.3 billion in the third quarter and $5.8 billion in the first nine months of 2023, decreases of $110 million (4.5%) and $50 million (0.8%) versus 2022. The declines reflected changes in operating revenues attributable to rates and volumes and in thermal generation and purchased power costs. Retail customer volumes decreased 0.6% overall (down 0.5% at PacifiCorp and 2.3% at NV Energy and up 1.1% at MEC) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather, partially offset by an overall increase in the average number of customers and in customer usage. 39 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BHE (Continued) After-tax earnings of natural gas pipelines decreased $59 million (25.2%) in the third quarter and $24 million (3.2%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The declines reflected higher operating expenses in 2023 and the impact of favorable income tax adjustments in 2022, partially offset by higher regulated transportation and storage services revenues from certain general rate cases and favorable interest and other income. After-tax earnings of other energy businesses decreased $65 million (18.0%) in the third quarter and $243 million (21.9%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. These declines reflected unfavorable operating performance at a natural gas exploration project and lower earnings from renewable energy and retail services businesses, primarily attributable to lower income tax benefits, higher operating expenses, lower solar and wind generation at owned projects and the impact of unfavorable changes in valuations of derivatives contracts, partially offset by debt extinguishment gains. Earnings in the first nine months of 2023 also included deferred income tax expense related to the enactment of the new Energy Profits Levy income tax in the United Kingdom. After-tax earnings of real estate brokerage decreased $4 million (13.8%) in the third quarter and $109 million (81.3%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The decreases reflected lower brokerage services revenues and margins, primarily due to a 22% year-to-date reduction in closed brokerage transaction volumes, as well as lower mortgage services revenues and margins from a 33% year-to-date decrease in closed transaction volumes. These declines were attributable to the impact of rising interest rates, including lower existing home sales and mortgage refinancing demand. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $42 million in the third quarter and $30 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting lower federal income tax credits recognized and higher BHE corporate interest expense from an April 2022 debt issuance, partially offset by higher interest and other income. Pilot Travel Centers, LLC ( “ PTC ” ) PTC is headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee and operates travel centers in North America (primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J) with more than 750 travel center locations across 44 states and six Canadian provinces. PTC also operates large wholesale fuel and fuel marketing platforms in the U.S. A substantial portion of PTC’s revenues and earnings derive from marketing fuel on a wholesale and retail basis and from other energy-related activities. Through January 31, 2023, we owned a 38.6% interest in PTC, which we accounted for under the equity method. Our proportionate share of PTC’s net earnings for the month ending January 31, 2023 and first nine months of 2022 are included in equity method earnings in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in PTC, and we currently own an 80% controlling interest. Thus, we began consolidating PTC’s results of operations in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings on February 1, 2023. PTC’s earnings for the third quarter of 2023 and the eight months ending September 30, 2023 are summarized below (in millions). Third Quarter Eight Months Ending 2023 September 30, 2023 Revenues $ 13,166 $ 37,428 Cost of sales 11,980 34,385 Operating and other expenses 782 2,133 Interest expense 113 297 Pre-tax earnings 291 613 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 108 233 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 183 $ 380 40 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Pilot Travel Centers, LLC ( “ PTC ” ) (Continued) PTC’s revenues and earnings are highly dependent on diesel fuel and gasoline volumes, prices and margins. Revenues for the third quarter of 2023 and the eight months ending September 30, 2023 were $13.2 billion and $37.4 billion, respectively. PTC’s pre-tax earnings for the third quarter of 2023 and the eight months ending September 30, 2023 were $291 million and $613 million, respectively. Operating and other expenses included depreciation and amortization expense of $250 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $661 million in the eight months ending September 30, 2023. PTC’s consolidated pre-tax earnings for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 and 2022 are summarized below. Revenues, costs and expenses for the first nine months of 2022 and first month of 2023 are not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, whereas such information for the eight months ending September 30, 2023 are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months Percentage Change 2023 2022 2023 2022 Third Quarter First Nine Months Revenues $ 13,166 $ 19,197 $ 42,448 $ 55,198 (31.4 )% (23.1 )% Cost of sales 11,980 17,763 39,079 51,891 (32.6 ) (24.7 ) Operating and other expenses 782 654 2,346 1,892 19.6 24.0 Interest expense 113 61 321 154 85.2 108.4 Pre-tax earnings $ 291 $ 719 $ 702 $ 1,261 (59.5 ) (44.3 ) Revenues for the first nine months of 2023 and 2022 were approximately $42.5 billion and $55.2 billion, respectively. Revenues were lower in 2023, primarily due to significantly lower fuel prices, as well as from lower fuel sales volumes. For the first nine months of 2023, PTC sold approximately 12.2 billion gallons of diesel fuel, gasoline and other fuel-related products compared to 13.6 billion gallons in 2022. Cost of sales in 2022 included significantly higher LIFO inventory charges than in 2023, attributable to the significant increases in fuel prices during the first half of 2022. Interest expense increased $51 million in the third quarter and $166 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher interest rates. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months Percentage Change 2023 2022 2023 2022 Third Quarter First Nine Months Revenues Manufacturing $ 19,174 $ 19,000 $ 56,565 $ 57,193 0.9 % (1.1 )% Service and retailing 23,423 23,136 69,437 67,645 1.2 2.6 $ 42,597 $ 42,136 $ 126,002 $ 124,838 Pre-tax earnings Manufacturing $ 3,077 $ 2,883 $ 8,791 $ 8,735 6.7 % 0.6 % Service and retailing 1,302 1,314 4,027 3,806 (0.9 ) 5.8 4,379 4,197 12,818 12,541 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,038 950 3,106 3,020 Net earnings* $ 3,341 $ 3,247 $ 9,712 $ 9,521 Effective income tax rate 22.9 % 22.1 % 23.5 % 23.6 % Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues 10.3 % 10.0 % 10.2 % 10.0 % —————— * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, primarily related to the amortization of identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings were $173 million in the third quarter and $525 million in the first nine months of 2023 and $161 million in the third quarter and $484 million in the first nine months of 2022. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page 30 and in the “Other” earnings section on page 47. 41 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of these operations follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2023 2022 2023 2022 Revenues Industrial products $ 8,667 $ 7,723 $ 26,406 $ 22,912 Building products 6,739 7,589 19,442 22,011 Consumer products 3,768 3,688 10,717 12,270 $ 19,174 $ 19,000 $ 56,565 $ 57,193 Pre-tax earnings Industrial products $ 1,427 $ 1,375 $ 4,388 $ 3,861 Building products 1,167 1,236 3,289 3,687 Consumer products 483 272 1,114 1,187 $ 3,077 $ 2,883 $ 8,791 $ 8,735 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Industrial products 16.5 % 17.8 % 16.6 % 16.9 % Building products 17.3 16.3 16.9 16.8 Consumer products 12.8 7.4 10.4 9.7 Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)) and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). The industrial products group also includes certain non-insurance businesses acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition including W&W|AFCO Steel, a structural steel fabrication products business, and certain other businesses that were combined into Marmon. Revenues of the industrial products group increased $944 million (12.2%) in the third quarter and $3.5 billion (15.2%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings increased $52 million (3.8%) in the third quarter and $527 million (13.6%) in the first nine months of 2023. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 16.6% for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 0.3 percentage points compared to the first nine months of 2022. Operating results of the group in the first nine months of 2023 reflected the impact of business acquisitions and overall improved operating results at certain of our pre-existing businesses. PCC’s revenues were $2.3 billion in the third quarter and $6.9 billion in the first nine months of 2023, increases of 21.4% in the third quarter and 26.0% in the first nine months compared to 2022. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from sales of aerospace products. The revenue increases in 2023 were primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products, while power/energy and general and industrial products also contributed to the overall revenue increases. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 43.1% in the third quarter and 32.5% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The improved results in 2023 reflect the increases in sales and improving manufacturing and operating efficiencies. We continue to strive to improve manufacturing efficiencies, maintain safety and prepare for increasing demand for PCC’s products. Continued growth in PCC’s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace product demand. 42 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Lubrizol’s revenues were $1.6 billion in the third quarter and $4.9 billion in the first nine months of 2023, decreases of 10.0% in the third quarter and 3.6% in the first nine months compared to 2022. The revenue declines were primarily due to lower volumes of approximately 10% in both periods. Revenues in the first nine months of 2023 also reflected unfavorable foreign currency translation effects in the first six months partially offset by higher average selling prices. Lower sales volumes in 2023 were attributable to general market weakness, resulting in lower demand in most product lines. Sales volumes through the first nine months of 2022 were restricted by raw material supply constraints, which limited Lubrizol’s production capabilities. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings declined 41.2% in the third quarter and 19.8% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings in 2022 included insurance recoveries of $142 million in the third quarter and $242 million in the first nine months in connection with fires at certain production facilities in 2021 and 2020. Fire insurance recoveries in the first nine months of 2023 were $11 million. Excluding insurance recoveries, earnings in the third quarter of 2023 were higher due to lower raw material costs partially offset by the impact of lower sales volumes, while the first nine months of 2023 were higher due to the favorable impacts of higher selling prices, changes in product mix and lower raw material costs, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volumes, higher operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Marmon’s revenues were $3.0 billion in the third quarter and $9.2 billion in the first nine months of 2023, increases of 10.4% in the third quarter and 13.0% in the first nine months compared to 2022. Business acquisitions, including AP Emissions Technologies and three former Alleghany businesses: Kentucky Trailer, Wilbert Funeral Services, Inc. and Wilbert Plastics Services, accounted for $291 million and $886 million of comparative revenue increases in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. In addition, the Rail & Leasing, Water Technologies, Medical, Metal Services and Crane Services groups generated higher revenues in 2023, primarily due to higher volumes and pricing improvements. The Electrical, Transportation Products, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration group’s revenues in the first nine months of 2023 were negatively impacted by lower steel and copper prices. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings were essentially unchanged in the third quarter and increased 13.9% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings increases attributable to business acquisitions were $31 million in the third quarter and $72 million in the first nine months of 2023. Earnings in the first nine months of 2022 included losses of approximately $90 million in the Rail & Leasing group related to the shutdown of its business in Russia. Otherwise, comparative earnings from Marmon’s other business groups in the first nine months of 2023 were mixed, reflecting earnings increases in the Rail & Leasing, Transportation Products, Water Technologies and Crane Services groups, primarily attributable to revenue growth, and lower earnings in the Electrical group, driven by lower margins in the building wire business. IMC’s revenues were $1.0 billion in the third quarter and $3.0 billion in the first nine months of 2023, increases of 8.2% in the third quarter and 7.9% in the first nine months compared to 2022. The revenue increases in 2023 reflected increased organic sales in North America, the impact of business acquisitions and higher interest income due to higher rates, partially offset by lower revenues in Asia, unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar and the impact of geopolitical conflicts. IMC’s pre-tax earnings were relatively flat in the third quarter and increased 6.4% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. In the first nine months of 2023, the impact of revenue increases was partially offset by higher raw material costs, changes in sales mix and the adverse effects of geopolitical conflicts. A large portion of IMC’s products are manufactured in Israel. To date, IMC’s operations in Israel have not been significantly impacted by the terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 and the ongoing conflict. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Revenues of the building products group declined $850 million (11.2%) in the third quarter and $2.6 billion (11.7%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings declined $69 million (5.6%) in the third quarter and $398 million (10.8%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. Our building products businesses benefited in recent years from the low interest rate environment and strong residential and commercial construction markets. The effects of significant increases in home mortgage interest rates in the U.S. over the past year has slowed demand for our home building businesses and our other building products businesses. Such effects have been partially mitigated by new construction activity, resulting from low supplies of pre-existing homes for sale. We continue to anticipate certain of our businesses will experience weakening demand and declines in revenues and earnings into 2024. 43 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) Clayton Homes’ revenues declined 8.8% to $3.0 billion in the third quarter and 12.0% to $8.4 billion in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. Revenues from home sales decreased $1.3 billion (17.1%) in the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to lower unit sales and changes in product mix. New home unit sales declined 17.5% in the first nine months of 2023, reflecting lower overall unit sales for factory-built and site-built homes. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 11.3% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased interest income on higher average loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $23.1 billion as of September 30, 2023, an increase of 13.2% since September 30, 2022. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes declined $89 million (14.0%) in the third quarter and $239 million (13.7%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily attributable to lower earnings from the home building businesses, partially offset by increased earnings from financial services. The increases in financial services earnings were primarily attributable to increased net interest income, partially offset by increased expected loan loss provisions and higher insurance claims. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $3.8 billion in the third quarter and $11.1 billion in the first nine months of 2023, decreases of $563 million (13.1%) in the third quarter and $1.4 billion (11.4%) in the first nine months versus 2022. The comparative revenue declines reflected overall lower sales volumes and changes in product mix, partly offset by higher average selling prices. Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses increased $19 million (3.2%) in the third quarter and declined $160 million (8.2%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings as a percentage of revenues in the first nine months of 2023 increased 0.5 percentage points versus 2022. The earnings of our other building products businesses in 2023 benefited from lower average prices for certain raw materials and energy and reduced freight, shipping and utilities expenses and were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes and reduced manufacturing efficiencies. Earnings in 2022 benefited from higher selling prices and strong demand in certain product categories and an increase in the gains from a business divestiture and asset sales of $58 million in the third quarter and $169 million in the first nine months. Consumer products The consumer products group includes recreational vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl), jewelry products (Richline), Jazwares, LLC (Jazwares), a global toy company acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition. Jazwares revenues and earnings tend to be seasonally higher in the second half of the year. Consumer products group revenues decreased $80 million (2.2%) in the third quarter and $1.6 billion (12.7%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The declines reflected lower revenues at Forest River and nearly all of our apparel and footwear operations, partially offset by the impact of the Jazwares acquisition, which contributed revenues of $847 million in the first nine months of 2023. Forest River’s revenues declined 17.1% in the third quarter and 31.5% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting an overall 34.5% decline in unit sales in the first nine months and changes in sales mix. Forest River experienced strong recreational vehicle unit sales in recent years and through the first half of 2022. Since then, sales volumes have declined significantly, attributable in part to the impact of rising interest rates, inflation and other macroeconomic conditions. The sales volume declines for recreational vehicles in 2023 were partially offset by increased sales by the bus and commercial business. Revenues of our apparel and footwear businesses declined $148 million (11.2%) in the third quarter and $370 million (9.9%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to reduced apparel sales. Apparel business revenues declined 15.1% for the first nine months of 2023 attributable to lower volumes from declining customer demand, partially offset by higher average selling prices and sales mix changes. Duracell’s revenues increased 7.9% in the third quarter and declined 2.4% in the first nine months of 2023 versus 2022. Pre-tax earnings of our consumer products group increased $211 million (77.6%) in the third quarter and declined $73 million (6.1%) in the first nine months of 2023 versus 2022. Pre-tax earnings in 2023 reflected increases due to the Jazwares acquisition and improved earnings of the apparel and footwear businesses and lower earnings from Forest River. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group increased 0.7 percentage points in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. 44 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Consumer products (Continued) Earnings from Forest River declined 34.8% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the decrease in unit sales and product mix changes, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Apparel and footwear earnings increased 27.3% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to earnings in 2022, which were negatively impacted by a combination of low sales volumes and rising raw materials, freight, labor and other operating costs. Our apparel businesses continued to be negatively affected by lower sales volumes and reduced manufacturing efficiencies in 2023, which were partially offset by increased selling prices and reduced markdowns. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2023 2022 2023 2022 Revenues Service $ 5,100 $ 4,771 $ 15,600 $ 14,031 Retailing 4,846 4,796 14,418 14,268 McLane 13,477 13,569 39,419 39,346 $ 23,423 $ 23,136 $ 69,437 $ 67,645 Pre-tax earnings Service $ 772 $ 806 $ 2,433 $ 2,286 Retailing 414 396 1,236 1,250 McLane 116 112 358 270 $ 1,302 $ 1,314 $ 4,027 $ 3,806 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Service 15.1 % 16.9 % 15.6 % 16.3 % Retailing 8.5 8.3 8.6 8.8 McLane 0.9 0.8 0.9 0.7 Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training services and products to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). This group also includes IPS-Integrated Project Services, LLC (IPS), a provider of various services in facilities construction management that was acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition. Service group revenues increased $329 million (6.9%) in the third quarter and $1.6 billion (11.2%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. IPS contributed revenues of $343 million in the third quarter and $947 million in the first nine months of 2023. Revenues from aviation services increased 8.3% in the third quarter and 11.5% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The revenue increases were primarily due to increases in the number of aircraft in shared aircraft ownership programs and a year-to-date increase in flight hours across NetJets’ various programs, as well as higher average rates. Revenues from TTI declined 7.2% in the third quarter and 0.8% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. Excluding the effects of business acquisitions in 2022 and 2023 and the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, third quarter and year-to-date sales declined 10.7% and 3.0%, respectively, in 2023 versus 2022. TTI experienced significant revenue growth in 2021 and much of 2022. Since the third quarter of 2022, new orders have slowed in several regions and markets, particularly in the Asia Pacific region, in part attributable to elevated customer inventory levels and increasing price competition. We currently expect these conditions will persist over the remainder of 2023 and into 2024. Pre-tax earnings of the service group declined $34 million (4.2%) in the third quarter and increased $147 million (6.4%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues declined 0.7 percentage points in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The changes in comparative earnings in 2023 reflected increases from aviation services businesses, primarily attributable to higher overall margin rates due to a 15.4% year-to-date increase in average aircraft in the NetJets programs, the impact of the IPS acquisition and lower earnings from TTI. Year-to-date earnings from TTI declined 10.3%, attributable to reduced sales and gross margin rates, and higher operating expenses, partly offset by the impact of lower foreign currency exchange losses in 2023. 45 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), representing 68% of our combined retailing revenues in the first nine months of 2023. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also offers vehicle service contracts and operates two insurance businesses. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 18% of the combined retailing revenues in the first nine months of 2023. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailers (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionery products), Pampered Chef (high-quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. Retailing group revenues increased 1.0% in the third quarter and 1.1% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting increases at BHA, partially offset by lower revenues from our other retailers. BHA’s revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 increased 3.9% and 4.3%, respectively, compared to 2022. Revenues from new vehicle sales increased 13.7% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022, while revenues from pre-owned vehicle retail sales declined 9.3%. Unit sales in the first nine months of 2023 increased 2.6%, reflecting an 11.5% increase in new vehicle sales and a 4.6% decrease in pre-owned vehicles sold. Although new vehicle inventory levels remain well below historical levels, vehicle supply continues to gradually rise. Revenues from BHA’s parts/service/repair operations in the first nine months of 2023 increased 8.2% versus 2022. Other retailing revenues in the aggregate declined 5.2% in the first nine months of 2023 versus 2022, due to an 8.7% decline in revenues at our home furnishings businesses, primarily attributable to lower customer traffic. Retailing group pre-tax earnings increased $18 million (4.5%) in the third quarter and decreased $14 million (1.1%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 14.2% in the third quarter and 18.6% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. BHA’s earnings increases reflected higher earnings from parts/service/repair and finance/service contract operations and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower vehicle gross profit margin rates and higher floor plan interest expense. BHA’s comparative vehicle gross profit margin rates, before the effects of LIFO, peaked in the first half of 2022 and have since been reverting to historical levels. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined $146 million (26.9%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a 31.1% decrease in home furnishings businesses earnings and the impact of a gain in 2022 from the divestiture of certain jewelry stores. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice distribution businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins and operate in a highly competitive environment. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues declined 0.7% in the third quarter and increased 0.2% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. Revenues in 2023 of the grocery and the foodservice businesses were negatively affected by lower unit volumes. Grocery sales comprised 62% of McLane’s consolidated sales in the first nine months of 2023, with foodservice representing most of the remainder. Pre-tax earnings increased $4 million (3.6%) in the third quarter and $88 million (32.6%) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The year-to-date increases in earnings reflected a slight increase in the overall gross sales margin rate and lower fuel expenses, partly offset by higher personnel expenses. Non-Controlled Businesses After-tax earnings of our non-controlled businesses include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Occidental Petroleum, PTC (through January 31, 2023) and Berkadia. After-tax earnings attributable to these businesses decreased $120 million in the third quarter and increased $519 million in the first nine months of 2023 versus 2022. We adopted the equity method of accounting for our investment in Occidental Petroleum common stock on August 4, 2022. As of January 31, 2023, we discontinued using the equity method for our pre-existing 38.6% interest in PTC upon acquiring a controlling interest in PTC. We began consolidating PTC’s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements on February 1, 2023. See Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 46 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment and Derivative Contract Gains (Losses) A summary of investment and derivative contract gains (losses) follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2023 2022 2023 2022 Investment gains (losses) $ (29,778 ) $ (13,500 ) $ 38,041 $ (82,089 ) Derivative contract gains (losses) — 35 — (273 ) Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests (29,778 ) (13,465 ) 38,041 (82,362 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (6,250 ) (3,016 ) 8,261 (17,295 ) Net earnings (loss) $ (23,528 ) $ (10,449 ) $ 29,780 $ (65,067 ) Effective income tax rate 20.9 % 20.9 % 21.6 % 20.8 % Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Unrealized gains and losses recorded in earnings also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in equity securities of non-U.S. issuers held by our U.S.-based subsidiaries. Pre-tax investment gains and losses included net unrealized losses of $30.4 billion in the third quarter and net unrealized gains of $33.3 billion in the first nine months of 2023. Net unrealized losses were $12.9 billion in the third quarter and $80.5 billion in the first nine months of 2022. Such amounts related to securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Taxable gains and losses on equity securities sold generally represent the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost of the securities sold. Sales of equity securities produced taxable gains of $759 million in the third quarter and $5.4 billion in the first nine months of 2023 compared to taxable gains of $3 million in the third quarter and losses of $660 million in the first nine months of 2022. Pre-tax investment gains in the first nine months of 2023 included a non-cash gain of approximately $3.0 billion related to the remeasurement of our pre-existing interest in PTC to fair value through the application of acquisition accounting upon attaining control of PTC for financial reporting purposes. We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We also continue to believe the investment gains and losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2023 2022 2023 2022 Acquisition accounting expenses $ (194 ) $ (161 ) $ (596 ) $ (484 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (53 ) (66 ) (171 ) (203 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes 447 858 895 2,441 Other earnings 200 48 501 207 $ 400 $ 679 $ 629 $ 1,961 After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate gains pertain to Berkshire’s and BHFC’s Euro, Great Britain Pound and Japanese Yen denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. In 2023 and 2022, we recorded foreign currency exchange rate gains on these debt issues due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, which reduced the U.S Dollar carrying value of the debt. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other earnings consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes. 47 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Our Consolidated Balance Sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Our Consolidated shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2023 was $525.3 billion, a decrease of $14.6 billion during the third quarter and an increase of $51.9 billion during the first nine months of 2023. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders included after-tax losses of $23.5 billion in the third quarter of 2023 on our investments compared to after-tax gains of $29.8 billion in the first nine months. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities will produce significant volatility in our earnings. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $7.0 billion in the first nine months of 2023 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. At September 30, 2023, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $152.0 billion, which included $127.6 billion invested in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stock) were $341.1 billion. During the first nine months of 2023, we paid cash of $9.1 billion to acquire equity securities and we received proceeds of $32.8 billion from sales of equity securities. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in PTC for approximately $8.2 billion. Our consolidated borrowings at September 30, 2023 were $124.8 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF, BHE and its subsidiaries and PTC. During the first nine months of 2023, we issued term debt of approximately $6.3 billion and repaid $9.6 billion on maturing term debt. Berkshire parent company outstanding debt at September 30, 2023 was $17.2 billion, a decrease of $4.2 billion since December 31, 2022. Berkshire repaid $4.3 billion of maturing debt in the first six months of 2023. In April 2023, Berkshire issued ¥164.4 billion (approximately $1.2 billion) of senior notes. Senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, were approximately $17.9 billion at September 30, 2023, substantially unchanged from December 31, 2022. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.5 billion as of September 30, 2023, substantially unchanged from December 31, 2022. In June 2023, BNSF issued $1.6 billion of 5.2% debentures due in 2054. During the first nine months of 2023, BNSF repaid approximately $1.5 billion of term debt. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $54.3 billion at September 30, 2023, an increase of $1.6 billion from December 31, 2022. In the first nine months of 2023, BHE and its subsidiaries issued $3.5 billion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.7% and maturity dates ranging from 2034 to 2054 and repaid approximately $2.3 billion of term debt. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months are approximately $3.5 billion. Borrowings of PTC were $5.9 billion as of the January 31, 2023 acquisition date and were $6.0 billion at September 30, 2023. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt or other borrowings issued by BNSF, BHE, PTC or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates. In the first nine months of 2023, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of $34.8 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $13.7 billion in the first nine months of 2023, which included capital expenditures by BNSF and BHE of $9.4 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast capital expenditures for BHE and BNSF in the fourth quarter of 2023 of approximately $4.2 billion. On September 1, 2023, a BHE subsidiary acquired an additional 50% limited partnership interest in its Cove Point LNG, LP subsidiary for $3.3 billion. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“the 2022 Act”) was signed into law. The 2022 Act contains numerous provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax (“CAMT”) on “adjusted financial statement income”, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The provisions of the 2022 Act are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The extent to which the Company incurs CAMT will depend on the facts and circumstances of the given tax year. We do not expect to incur a CAMT liability in 2023. The Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of Treasury may release additional guidance in the future. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the 2022 Act as more guidance becomes available. 48 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were $143.7 billion at September 30, 2023. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of September 30, 2023, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF, aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets and certain raw materials purchase commitments. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2023 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2023 includes estimated liabilities of $143.7 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2023 included goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $85.7 billion and indefinite lived intangible assets of $20.5 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2022. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2022, the estimated fair values of six reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). Our estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $31.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $30.3 billion by 4.0%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the five other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $4.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $4.1 billion by 9.9%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.4 billion. 49 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. As of September 30, 2023, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts and general changes in business conditions, as well as other unanticipated events, on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently anticipate, and we may need to record goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units are inherently subjective and will likely continue to be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of adverse events on a reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates can be subject to wide variations. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, an act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; geopolitical conflicts or events and changes in general economic and market factors that negatively affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. 50 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of September 30, 2023, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Reference is made to Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning certain litigation involving Berkshire subsidiaries. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that any liability that may arise as a result of such other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Ris k Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. 51 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use o f Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the third quarter of 2023 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program July Class A common stock 177 $ 521,430.04 177 * Class B common stock — $ — — * August Class A common stock 607 $ 541,740.69 607 * Class B common stock — $ — — * September Class A common stock 1,115 $ 550,813.96 1,115 * Class B common stock 143,675 $ 357.22 143,675 * —————— * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $30 billion. Item 3. Defaults Upo n Senior Securities None Item 4. Mine Safe ty Disclosures Information regarding the Company’s mine safety violations and other legal matters disclosed in accordance with Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-Q. Item 5. Other Information Berkshire has never adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as that term is defined in Item 408(a)(1)(i) of Regulation S-K).

General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For several reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, the magnitude of gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. To varying degrees, our operating businesses have been impacted by government and private sector actions to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 virus and its variants as well as by the development of geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow inflation. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2. New accounting pronouncements We adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2018-12”) as of January 1, 2023, which modifies the accounting, reporting and disclosures related to long-duration insurance contracts, including the measurement of our long-duration life, annuity and health benefit liabilities. ASU 2018-12 was applied retrospectively to contracts in-force beginning as of January 1, 2021 (the “transition date”). As of the transition date, the after-tax impact of changes in cash flow assumptions were recorded in retained earnings and the after-tax effect of changes in discount rate assumptions were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 and as of the January 1, 2021 transition date were revised for the effects of adopting ASU 2018-12. These effects were included in Part II, Item 5 to our Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2023. Beginning as of January 1, 2021, the cash flow assumptions used to measure benefit liabilities are reviewed at least annually, with the effects of assumption changes recorded in earnings. The discount rate assumptions used to measure benefit liabilities are revised each quarterly reporting period with the effects of changes reported in other comprehensive income. Discount rates are based on the prevailing upper-medium grade corporate bond yields (generally single A-rated credit ratings) that reflect the duration characteristics and currency attributes of the liabilities. In measuring benefit liabilities and amortizing capitalized acquisition costs under long-duration insurance contracts, we generally aggregate contracts by issuance year. See Note 16 for disclosures related to our long-duration insurance contracts. A summary of the impacts of adopting ASU 2018-12 on our periodic payment annuity and life and health insurance benefits liabilities as of the January 1, 2021 transition date follows in millions.

New accounting pronouncements ( Continued) The reclassifications to other policyholder liabilities are primarily related to certain liabilities arising under our variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts. These liabilities are not classified as life, annuity and health insurance benefits liabilities under ASU 2018-12. The effects of adopting ASU 2018-12 on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for the second quarter and first six months of 2022 follows in millions, except per share amounts.

ASU 2023-02 permits reporting entities to elect to account for tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Currently, the proportional amortization method is limited to certain affordable housing tax credit investments. ASU 2023-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and is applied either on a retrospective basis beginning as of the earliest period presented or a modified retrospective basis in the period of adoption. We are evaluating the effects of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 3. Significant business acquisitions Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4 % interest in Pilot Travel Centers, LLC (“Pilot”) for approximately $ 8.2 billion. We previously owned a 38.6 % interest in Pilot and accounted for that investment under the equity method. We now possess a controlling interest in Pilot for financial reporting purposes. We applied the equity method through the end of January 2023 and began consolidating Pilot’s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements on February 1, 2023. Pilot is headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee and operates travel centers in North America (primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J) with more than 650 travel center locations across 43 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces. Pilot also has over 150 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada where it sells diesel fuel through various arrangements with third party travel centers. Among its business activities, Pilot operates large wholesale fuel and fuel marketing platforms in the U.S. and operates a water hauling and disposal business in the oil fields sector. As Pilot’s most significant business activities involve purchasing and selling fuel (energy) on a wholesale and retail basis, and engaging in other energy-related business activities, including oil field services, we have included Pilot within the railroad, utilities and energy sections of our Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Earnings beginning February 1, 2023. 9 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3. Significant business acquisitions ( Continued) Pilot’s revenues and net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders included in Berkshire’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the five months ending June 30, 2023 were $ 24.3 billion and $ 197 million, respectively. Our equity method earnings from Pilot for the month of January 2023 were $ 105 million. In applying the acquisition method of accounting, we were required to remeasure our previously held 38.6 % investment in Pilot to fair value. In the first quarter of 2023, we recognized a one-time, non-cash remeasurement gain of approximately $ 3.0 billion, representing the excess of the fair value of that interest over the carrying value under the equity method, as a component of investment gains (losses). The holder of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Pilot has the option to require us to redeem for cash, all or a portion of the interest beginning in 2024. The cash consideration will be based on Pilot’s future earnings, cash and debt. We have concluded that the remaining Pilot noncontrolling interest represents a redeemable interest under GAAP and are presenting such interests between liabilities and shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We valued the noncontrolling interest at fair value as of the acquisition date. Thereafter, we will increase or decrease the redeemable noncontrolling interest by the share of the earnings or losses attributable to the interest and will further adjust the balance, as appropriate, if the current estimated redemption value exceeds the carrying value. The preliminary values of Pilot’s assets acquired, liabilities assumed and redeemable noncontrolling interests as of January 31, 2023 are summarized as follows (in millions). The valuations of certain assets and liabilities, including property, plant and equipment, other intangible assets and goodwill, as of the acquisition date have not been finalized and are provisional.

Alleghany operates a group of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses. It also owns a portfolio of non-financial businesses. Goodwill arising from Berkshire’s acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. A summary of the values of the Alleghany assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of October 19, 2022 follows (in millions).

Investments in equity securities (Continued) During 2022, we began to acquire common stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”). Our aggregate voting interest in Occidental exceeded 20 % on August 4, 2022 and we adopted the equity method as of that date. See Note 6. We report our investments in Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock and Occidental common stock warrants at fair value as equity securities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as such interests are not in-substance common stock under GAAP and are not eligible for the equity method. The Occidental preferred stock accrues dividends at 8 % per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation value, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. As of June 30, 2023, our investment in Occidental preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation value of approximately $ 8.8 billion. During the first six months of 2023, Occidental issued mandatory redemption notifications at a price of 110 % of the liquidation value, plus accrued and unpaid dividends for $ 1.2 billion of the aggregate liquidation value. The mandatory redemptions were due to excess distributions by Occidental to its common stockholders (as defined under the terms of Occidental preferred stock certificate of designations). Our investment in Occidental warrants allows us to purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $ 59.62 per share. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the date the preferred stock is fully redeemed. On June 30, 2023, we owned 151.6 million shares of American Express Company (“American Express”) common stock representing 20.6 % of the American Express outstanding common stock. Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors. We have also agreed to passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we do not use the equity method with respect to our investment in American Express common stock and we continue to record our investment at fair value. Note 6. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these are our investments in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”) and Occidental. As of June 30, 2023, we owned 26.5 % of the outstanding Kraft Heinz common stock and 25.1 % of the outstanding Occidental common stock, which excludes the potential effect of the exercise of the Occidental common stock warrants. Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Occidental is an international energy company, whose activities include oil and natural gas exploration, development and production and chemicals manufacturing businesses. Occidental’s financial information is not available in time for concurrent reporting in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, we report the equity method effects for Occidental on a one-quarter lag. The common stock of Kraft Heinz and Occidental are publicly traded. The fair values and our carrying values of these investments in addition to the carrying values of our other significant equity method investments are summarized as follows (in millions). We evaluated our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental for other-than-temporary impairment as of June 30, 2023, and based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, concluded the recognition of an impairment charge in earnings was not required. Carrying Value Fair Value June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Kraft Heinz $ 13,199 $ 12,937 $ 11,553 $ 13,249 Occidental 13,861 11,484 13,179 12,242 Other 433 3,629 $ 27,493 $ 28,050 12 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 6. Equity method investments (Continued) Our other significant equity method investments included Pilot through January 31, 2023. Beginning February 1, 2023, we ceased accounting for Pilot under the equity method and began consolidating Pilot for financial reporting purposes. Our investment in Pilot under the equity method was $ 3.2 billion at December 31, 2022. Other significant equity method investments also included our 50 % interest in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”) with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50 % interest. Berkadia provides capital solutions, investment sales advisory and mortgage servicing for multifamily and commercial real estate. Berkadia’s commercial paper borrowing capacity (currently limited to $ 1.5 billion) is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. The carrying values of our investments in Kraft Heinz and Berkadia approximate our share of the net equity of each of these entities. The carrying value of our investment in Occidental common stock exceeded our share of its shareholders’ equity as of March 31, 2023 by approximately $ 9 billion. Based upon the limited information available to us, we concluded the excess represents goodwill. Our earnings and distributions received from equity method investments are summarized in the following table (in millions). As previously indicated, we are reporting the equity method effects for Occidental on a one-quarter lag. Thus, the earnings we recorded in 2023 related to Occidental’s earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023. Equity method earnings attributable to Pilot were $ 105 million for the month ending January 31, 2023, $ 95 million for the second quarter of 2022 and $ 202 million for the first six months of 2022.

Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 and 2022 are summarized as follows (in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2023 2022 2023 2022 Investment gains (losses): Equity securities: Change in unrealized investment gains (losses) during the period on securities held at the end of the period $ 33,046 $ ( 66,860 ) $ 63,763 $ ( 68,548 ) Investment gains on securities sold during the period 31 32 1,001 34 33,077 ( 66,828 ) 64,764 ( 68,514 ) Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains 8 6 132 12 Gross realized losses ( 25 ) ( 27 ) ( 77 ) ( 76 ) Other 1 ( 5 ) 3,000 ( 11 ) Investment gains (losses) 33,061 ( 66,854 ) 67,819 ( 68,589 ) Derivative contract gains (losses) — ( 65 ) — ( 308 ) $ 33,061 $ ( 66,919 ) $ 67,819 $ ( 68,897 ) Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the period. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $ 25.8 billion in the first six months of 2023 and $ 12.0 billion in the first six months of 2022. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the period represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable period or, if later, the purchase date. Taxable gains and losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Equity securities sold produced taxable gains of $ 2.4 billion in the second quarter and $ 4.6 billion in the first six months of 2023 compared to taxable gains of $ 76 million in the second quarter of 2022 and taxable losses of $ 663 million in the first six months of 2022. Other investment gains in the first six months of 2023 included approximately $ 3 billion from the remeasurement of our pre-existing 38.6 % interest in Pilot through the application of acquisition accounting under GAAP.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses A reconciliation of the changes in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”), excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 15), for each of the six-month periods ending June 30, 2023 and 2022 follows (in millions). 2023 2022 Balances at beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 107,472 $ 86,664 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 5,025 ) ( 2,960 ) Net liabilities 102,447 83,704 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year 29,827 27,427 Prior accident years ( 1,948 ) ( 887 ) Total 27,879 26,540 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year ( 9,968 ) ( 10,085 ) Prior accident years ( 16,664 ) ( 13,820 ) Total ( 26,632 ) ( 23,905 ) Foreign currency effect 267 ( 568 ) Balances at June 30: Net liabilities 103,961 85,771 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 5,069 2,789 Gross liabilities $ 109,030 $ 88,560 Our claim liabilities under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. In the first six months, we recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 1.9 billion in 2023 and $ 887 million in 2022, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 1.9 % in 2023 and 1.1 % in 2022. We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of primary insurance businesses in the first six months by $ 1.1 billion in 2023 and $ 313 million in 2022. In 2023, the reductions were driven by private passenger auto claims, whereas the decreases in 2022 were primarily attributable to private passenger auto, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims, partly offset by increases with respect to other casualty claims. In the first six months, estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of property and casualty reinsurance businesses were reduced $ 883 million in 2023 and $ 574 million in 2022. 18 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for each of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 follow (in millions). 2023 2022 Balances at beginning of year $ 35,415 $ 37,855 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current year contracts — — Prior years’ contracts 15 ( 14 ) Total 15 ( 14 ) Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 1,033 ) ( 1,008 ) Foreign currency effect 24 ( 157 ) Balances at June 30 $ 34,421 $ 36,676 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses above $ 15 $ ( 14 ) Deferred charge amortization and adjustments 416 426 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings $ 431 $ 412 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposure to losses began. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include changes in estimated liabilities and related deferred charge asset amortization and adjustments arising from the changes in estimated timing and amount of future loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $ 9.5 billion at June 30, 2023 and $ 9.9 billion at December 31, 2022. Note 16. Long-duration insurance contracts We write periodic payment annuity and life and health insurance contracts, which are considered long-duration insurance contracts under GAAP. A summary of our life, annuity and health insurance benefits liabilities as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, disaggregated for our two primary product categories, periodic payment annuities and life and health insurance, follows (in millions). Other liabilities primarily consist of incurred-but-not-reported claims and claims in the course of settlement.

These liabilities are included in other policyholder liabilities and are measured at estimated fair value under ASU 2018-12. Such liabilities were approximately $ 1.0 billion as of June 30, 2023 and $ 1.25 billion as of December 31, 2022. During the first six months of 2023, we reduced liability estimates by $ 194 million, for the effects of changes in securities markets, interest rates and other inputs used to estimate liabilities. Cash settlements during the first six months of 2023 were relatively insignificant. Note 17. Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings of our insurance and other businesses are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges are based on borrowings as of June 30, 2023.

Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) In the first six months of 2023, Berkshire repaid approximately $ 4.3 billion of maturing senior notes. In April 2023, Berkshire issued ¥ 164.4 billion (approximately $ 1.2 billion) of senior notes. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. Berkshire also guarantees certain debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $ 2.7 billion at June 30, 2023. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 6.85 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 1,137 billion par at June 30, 2023) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates produced pre-tax gains of $ 555 million in the second quarter and $ 529 million in the first six months of 2023 as compared to pre-tax gains of $ 1.4 billion in the second quarter and $ 2.1 billion in the first six months of 2022. Notes payable and other borrowings of our railroad, utilities and energy businesses are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges are based on borrowings as of June 30, 2023. Weighted Average Interest Rate June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2023 - 2053 4.4 % $ 13,599 $ 13,996 Subsidiary and other debt due 2023 - 2064 4.3 % 38,021 37,639 Short-term borrowings 5.5 % 2,243 1,119 Pilot Travel Centers (“Pilot”) and subsidiaries due 2023 - 2028 7.0 % 5,789 — Burlington Northern Santa Fe (“BNSF”) and subsidiaries due 2023 - 2097 4.6 % 24,306 23,452 $ 83,958 $ 76,206 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In May 2023, a BHE subsidiary issued $ 1.2 billion of 5.5 % first mortgage bonds due in 2054 . During the first six months of 2023, BHE and its subsidiaries repaid approximately $ 1.4 billion of term debt. Pilot’s borrowings primarily represent secured syndicated loans. BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In June 2023, BNSF issued $ 1.6 billion of 5.2 % debentures due in 2054 . During the first six months of 2023, BNSF repaid approximately $ 700 million of term debt. As of June 30, 2023, BHE, BNSF and Pilot and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BHE, BNSF, Pilot or their subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries have unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $ 12.0 billion at June 30, 2023, which included approximately $ 8.6 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 22 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 18.

Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 follow (in millions).

These investments are private placements with contractual terms that restrict transfers and currently prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of liquidity and subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. 24 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19. Common stock Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the first six months of 2023 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Class A, $ 5 Par Value ( 1,650,000 shares authorized) Class B, $ 0.0033 Par Value ( 3,225,000,000 shares authorized) Issued Treasury Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding Balances at December 31, 2022 651,450 ( 59,886 ) 591,564 1,509,969,352 ( 207,715,276 ) 1,302,254,076 Conversions of Class A to Class B common stock ( 9,871 ) — ( 9,871 ) 14,806,500 — 14,806,500 Treasury stock acquired — ( 6,145 ) ( 6,145 ) — ( 9,071,308 ) ( 9,071,308 ) Balances at June 30, 2023 641,579 ( 66,031 ) 575,548 1,524,775,852 ( 216,786,584 ) 1,307,989,268 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,447,541 shares outstanding as of June 30, 2023 and 1,459,733 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth ( 1/1,500 ) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth ( 1/1,500 ) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times the average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $ 30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note 20. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were 20.3 % in the second quarter and 20.2 % in the first six months of 2023 compared to 21.8 % in the second quarter and 22.4 % in the first six months of 2022. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in certain equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, including investment gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions, and enacted changes thereto. 25 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 21.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. Generally, we do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. PacifiCorp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire’s 92 % owned subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), operates as a regulated electric utility in Oregon and other Western states. In September 2020, a severe weather event resulting in high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures contributed to several major wildfires (the “2020 Wildfires”), which resulted in real and personal property and natural resource damage, personal injuries and loss of life and widespread power outages in Oregon and Northern California. The wildfires spread across certain parts of PacifiCorp’s service territory and surrounding areas across multiple counties in Oregon and California, including Siskiyou County, California; Jackson County, Oregon; Douglas County, Oregon; Marion County, Oregon; Lincoln County, Oregon; and Klamath County, Oregon, burning over 500,000 acres in aggregate. Third-party reports for these wildfires indicate over 2,000 structures destroyed, including residences; several structures damaged; multiple individuals injured; and several fatalities. 26 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 23. Contingencies and commitments (Continued) Investigations into the cause and origin of each wildfire are complex and ongoing and being conducted by various entities, including the U.S. Forest Service, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Department of Forestry, the Oregon Department of Justice, PacifiCorp and various experts engaged by PacifiCorp. Numerous lawsuits on behalf of plaintiffs related to the 2020 Wildfires have been filed in Oregon and California, including a class action complaint against PacifiCorp that was filed in 2020, captioned Jeanyne James et al. v. PacifiCorp et al., in Multnomah County Circuit Court, Oregon (the “James case”). Amounts sought in the lawsuits, complaints and demands filed in Oregon total over $ 7 billion, excluding any doubling or trebling of damages included in the complaints. Generally, the complaints filed in California do not specify damages sought and are not included in this amount. Final determinations of liability will only be made following the completion of comprehensive investigations, litigation and similar processes. Several insurance carriers have filed subrogation complaints in Oregon and California with allegations similar to those made in the aforementioned lawsuits. Additionally, certain governmental agencies have informed PacifiCorp that they are contemplating filing actions in connection with certain of the Oregon 2020 Wildfires. In June 2023, a jury issued a verdict for the 17 named plaintiffs in the James case. The plaintiffs seek damages for economic losses, non-economic losses, including mental suffering, emotional distress, personal injury and loss of life, punitive damages, other damages and attorneys’ fees. PacifiCorp intends to vigorously appeal the jury’s findings and damage awards, including whether the case can proceed as a class action. The appeals process and further actions could take several years. Based on the facts and circumstances available to us as of the date of this filing, which includes the status of the verdict in the James case with respect to the 17 named plaintiffs, other litigation and recent settlements, PacifiCorp has accrued cumulative estimated pre-tax probable losses associated with the 2020 Wildfires of $ 1,018 million through June 30, 2023, or $ 608 million net of probable insurance recoveries. PacifiCorp’s cumulative accrual includes estimates of probable losses for fire suppression costs, real and personal property damages, natural resource damages for certain areas and non-economic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages that are considered probable of being incurred and that it is reasonably able to estimate at this time. For certain aspects of the 2020 Wildfires for which loss is considered probable, information necessary to reasonably estimate the potential losses, such as those related to certain areas of natural resource damages, is not currently available. It is reasonably possible PacifiCorp will incur significant additional losses beyond the amounts currently accrued; however, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible additional losses that could be incurred due to the number of properties and parties involved, including claimants in the class to the James case, the variation in those types of properties and lack of available details and the ultimate outcome of legal actions. On July 10, 2023, BHE announced that it had executed an agreement to acquire an additional 50 % interest in Cove Point LNG, LP, which would increase its interest to 75 %. The transaction is valued at $ 3.3 billion and is subject to applicable regulatory approvals. 27 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 24. Revenues from contracts with customers The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 and 2022 (in millions). Revenues from Pilot in 2023 are for the five months ending June 30, 2023. Other revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP, are primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines and marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. We acquired control of Pilot Travel Centers (“Pilot”) on January 31, 2023. Pilot’s revenues, costs and earnings are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, and Pilot is considered a reportable segment beginning February 1, 2023. In this presentation, the revenues and pre-tax earnings of the Pilot segment are for the five months ending June 30, 2023. Previously, our earnings from Pilot were determined under the equity method and are included in earnings from equity method investments. Revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes by segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions).

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. To varying degrees, our operating businesses have been impacted by government and private sector actions taken to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 virus and its variants as well as by the development of global geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow inflation. We cannot reliably predict the future economic effects of these events on our businesses. Insurance underwriting generated earnings of $1.25 billion in the second quarter and $2.16 billion in the first six months of 2023 versus $715 million in the second quarter and $882 million in the first six months of 2022. Earnings in 2022 reflect increases of $134 million in the second quarter and $254 million in the first six months from the previously reported amounts attributable to the adoption of ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023. Earnings from insurance investment income increased $463 million in the second quarter and $1.3 billion in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increases were primarily due to higher short-term interest rates, partly offset by lower dividend income. Earnings of BNSF declined 24.0% in the second quarter and 17.3% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The decreases were primarily attributable to lower overall freight volumes and higher non-fuel operating costs, offset by lower fuel costs. After-tax earnings of BHE were essentially unchanged in the second quarter and declined 23.2% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings decline in the first six months reflected lower earnings from the U.S. regulated utilities, other energy businesses and real estate brokerage businesses. As disclosed in Note 3 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, we increased our ownership in Pilot from 38.6% to 80% on January 31, 2023 and we are consolidating Pilot’s results beginning February 1, 2023. In 2022 and through January 31, 2023, earnings from Pilot on our 38.6% interest were determined under the equity method and are included in earnings from non-controlled businesses in the preceding table. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 4.3% in the second quarter and 1.5% in the first six months of 2023 versus 2022. While earnings for certain industrial products manufacturers and services businesses improved versus 2022, earnings of several of our building products, consumer products and retailing businesses deteriorated. Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) in each period of 2023 and 2022 predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment gains and losses on investments in equity securities, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) also included an after-tax non-cash remeasurement gain of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023 related to our previously held 38.6% interest in Pilot through the application of the acquisition accounting method. 31 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (Continued) Other earnings included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of $465 million in the second quarter and $448 million in the first six months of 2023 and $1.1 billion in the second quarter and $1.6 billion in the first six months of 2022. These gains related to the non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett, and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate the economic performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the quarterly or annual operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. We currently consider pre-tax incurred losses exceeding $150 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in the first six months of 2023 were a cyclone and floods in New Zealand and floods in Australia in 2022. Each of these events occurred in the first quarter of the year. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $143 billion as of June 30, 2023. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S.-based subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). Berkshire acquired Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”) on October 19, 2022. Alleghany operates a property and casualty insurance business through its subsidiaries, RSUI Group Inc. and CapSpecialty, Inc. (“RSUI and CapSpecialty” or “Alleghany Insurance”), and a reinsurance business through Transatlantic Reinsurance Company and affiliates (“TransRe Group”). Underwriting results of Alleghany Insurance are included in BH Primary and underwriting results of TransRe Group are included in BHRG. We strive to produce pre-tax underwriting earnings (premiums earned less insurance losses/benefits incurred and underwriting expenses) over the long term in all business categories, except for BHRG’s retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts businesses. Time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing prices for policies written by these businesses. We normally receive all premiums at the contract inception date, which are immediately available for investment. Ultimate claim payments can extend for decades and are expected to exceed premiums, producing underwriting losses over the claim settlement periods, primarily through deferred charge asset amortization and discounted liability accretion charges. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). BHRG’s pre-tax underwriting earnings for the second quarter and first six months of 2022 increased $174 million and $319 million, respectively, from pre-tax earnings previously reported due to the adoption of ASU 2018-12.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO GEICO primarily writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2023 2022 2023 2022 Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 9,449 $ 9,416 $ 19,509 $ 19,681 Premiums earned $ 9,714 100.0 $ 9,807 100.0 $ 19,340 100.0 $ 19,361 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 8,192 84.3 9,105 92.8 16,184 83.7 17,649 91.2 Underwriting expenses 1,008 10.4 1,189 12.2 1,939 10.0 2,377 12.2 Total losses and expenses 9,200 94.7 10,294 105.0 18,123 93.7 20,026 103.4 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ 514 $ (487 ) $ 1,217 $ (665 ) GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first six months of 2023 reflected higher average premiums per auto policy, a reduction in advertising costs, as well as reductions in prior accident years’ claims estimates. Premiums written and earned were substantially unchanged in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Premiums in 2023 reflected rate increases during the past 12 months that produced higher average premiums per auto policy (16.3%), as well as a 2.7 million decrease (14.4%) in policies-in-force over that period. GEICO significantly reduced advertising in 2022 and 2023, which contributed to the reduction in policies-in-force. Losses and loss adjustment expenses declined $913 million (10.0%) in the second quarter and $1.5 billion (8.3%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. GEICO’s loss ratio (losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned) was 84.3% in the second quarter and 83.7% in the first six months of 2023, decreases of 8.5 percentage points and 7.5 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. These decreases reflected the impact of higher average premiums per auto policy, additional reductions in prior accident years’ claims estimates, the reduction in policies-in-force and lower claims frequencies, partially offset by increases in average claims severities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months of 2023 included reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior accident years’ claims of $888 million compared to $207 million in 2022. The reduction in 2023 reflected decreased estimates across several coverages, while the reductions in 2022 were primarily attributable to bodily and personal injury coverages, partially offset by increases for collision and property damage coverages. Claims frequencies in the first six months of 2023 were lower for property damage (seven to eight percent range) and collision (seven to eight percent range) coverages, while claims frequencies increased for bodily injury (three to four percent range) and personal injury (one to two percent range) coverages. Average claims severities in the first six months of 2023 were higher for property damage (twenty-one to twenty-three percent range), collision (seven to nine percent range) and bodily injury (seven to nine percent range) coverages. Underwriting expenses declined $181 million (15.2%) in the second quarter and $438 million (18.4%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 10.4% in the second quarter and 10.0% in the first six months of 2023, decreases of 1.8 percentage points and 2.2 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. These decreases were driven by the reduction in advertising expenses.

The increases were primarily due to the inclusion of Alleghany Insurance ($746 million in the second quarter and $1.3 billion in the first six months), as well as comparative increases from BH Specialty and BH Direct. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $618 million (27.6%) in the second quarter and $1.0 billion (22.1%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The loss ratio decreased 0.1 percentage points in the second quarter and 2.9 percentage points in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting changes in business mix (including the impact of Alleghany Insurance), lower incurred losses from current year catastrophes and increased reductions in loss estimates for prior years’ events. Incurred losses from significant catastrophes occurring in the first six months were $36 million in 2023 and $75 million in 2022. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months reflected net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years’ claims of $177 million in 2023 and $106 million in 2022. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of workers’ compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Ultimate claims liabilities could be greater than anticipated due to a variety of factors, including from adverse legal and judicial rulings. Underwriting expenses increased $272 million (32.9%) in the second quarter and $557 million (35.3%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The expense ratio increased 1.0 percentage points in the second quarter and 1.5 percentage points in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increases were primarily attributable to changes in business mix, including the effects of the Alleghany Insurance acquisition. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and, beginning October 19, 2022, TransRe Group. We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO and we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (in millions). The retrospective adoption of ASU 2018-12 resulted in increases in pre-tax earnings of $174 million in the second quarter and $319 million in the first six months of 2022 from the previously reported amounts. These increases derived primarily from reductions in certain variable annuity guarantee liabilities.

Otherwise, premiums written in the first six months of 2023 increased $1.0 billion (11.9%) compared to 2022, primarily due to increases in property business and higher rates. Given the levels of property lines written and that we generally do not retrocede the risks we assume, our periodic underwriting earnings are subject to considerable volatility from significant catastrophe events. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $726 million (35.1%) in the second quarter and $1.8 billion (41.3%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily from the inclusion of TransRe Group ($785 million in the second quarter and $1.5 billion in the first six months of 2023). Overall, the loss ratio decreased 4.1 percentage points in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Losses incurred from significant catastrophes in the first six months were $528 million in 2023 and $629 million in 2022. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred reflected reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years’ claims of $883 million in the first six months of 2023 and $574 million in the first six months of 2022. Underwriting expenses in 2023 increased $920 million in the second quarter and $1.6 billion in the first six months compared to 2022. The expense ratio increased 12.5 percentage points in the second quarter and 9.5 percentage points in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increases were primarily attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in business mix, including the impact of TransRe Group. Foreign currency exchange losses were $118 million in the second quarter and $192 million in the first six months of 2023 compared to gains of $308 million in the second quarter and $389 million in the first six months of 2022 and related to the remeasurement of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Underwriting expenses included $385 million in the second quarter and $770 million in the first six months of 2023 related to TransRe Group. Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

In the first quarter of 2023, several of General Re’s life reinsurance contracts were commuted, which reduced premiums earned by $161 million and life benefits incurred by $304 million. Excluding these effects, premiums earned increased slightly in the second quarter and were substantially unchanged in the first six months of 2023, and life benefits incurred increased 11.8% in the second quarter and 1.5% in the first six months of 2023 versus 2022. The increase in the expense ratio in the first six months of 2023 versus 2022 was primarily attributable to the impact of the life reinsurance contract commutations and increased underwriting expenses. 35 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance Pre-tax underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance in each period derived from the amortization of deferred charges and the effects of changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax foreign currency exchange losses were $18 million in the second quarter and $24 million in the first six months of 2023 compared to pre-tax gains of $152 million in the second quarter and $157 million in the first six months of 2022. Before foreign currency exchange effects, pre-tax underwriting losses were $245 million in the second quarter and $434 million in the first six months of 2023 and $204 million in the second quarter and $399 million in the first six months of 2022. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $34.4 billion at June 30, 2023, a decline of $1.0 billion since December 31, 2022, primarily attributable to claim payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $9.5 billion at June 30, 2023, a decline of $416 million since December 31, 2022. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity business is price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, as well as the level of competition. Beginning in the latter part of 2022, prices for new business have declined to unacceptable levels and we have restricted writing new business. Our periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses from the recurring accretion of time-value discounted liabilities, which includes liabilities for contracts without life contingencies. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency exchange losses of $64 million in the second quarter and $83 million in the first six months of 2023 compared to gains of $86 million in the second quarter and $109 million in the first six months of 2022. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $147 million in the second quarter and $292 million in the first six months of 2023 and $140 million in the second quarter and $282 million in the first six months of 2022. Discounted liabilities were $14.8 billion at June 30, 2023, which included $4.0 billion for contracts without life contingencies. We adopted ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023, which requires that the discount rates on contracts with life-contingent liabilities be adjusted quarterly based upon prevailing interest rates with the effects of discount rate changes included in other comprehensive income. Variable annuity Our variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax gains of $130 million in the second quarter and $193 million in the first six months of 2023 and $147 million in the second quarter and $378 million in the first six months of 2022. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile. Our estimated liabilities associated with these contracts, which are in run-off, were approximately $1.0 billion as of June 30, 2023. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Dividend income declined 25.9% in the second quarter and 14.9% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. These reductions reflected net dispositions of investments since the end of the second quarter of 2022. Income in the first six months included $17 million in 2023 and $29 million in 2022 from BHE preferred stock. Such amounts were deducted from earnings of the BHE segment. Dividend income varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Interest and other investment income increased $1.2 billion in the second quarter and $2.1 billion in the first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases were primarily due to increases in short-term interest rates. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $166 billion at June 30, 2023 and $164 billion at December 31, 2022. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting gains in the first six months of 2023 and, consequently, the average cost of float was negative.

Average revenue per car/unit decreased slightly in the second quarter, while average revenue per car/unit increased 6.4% in the first six months of 2023 resulting from higher yield. BNSF’s pre-tax earnings were $1.6 billion in the second quarter and $3.3 billion the first six months of 2023, declines of 24.9% and 17.6%, respectively, compared to 2022. Operating revenues from consumer products were $1.9 billion in the second quarter and $3.8 billion in the first six months of 2023, decreases of 22.7% and 17.0%, respectively, from 2022. The revenue declines were attributable to volume decreases of 16.1% in the second quarter and 16.2% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022 and lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were primarily due to lower intermodal shipments resulting from lower west coast imports, the loss of an intermodal customer and competition from lower spot rates in the trucking market which has impacted our domestic intermodal demand. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in automotive volume from higher vehicle production. Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.4 billion in the second quarter and $2.8 billion in the first six months of 2023, a decrease of 0.8% and an increase of 2.6%, respectively, from 2022. The decline in the second quarter was primarily due to a volume decrease of 3.3%, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. The increase in the first six months was primarily due to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a 3.4% volume decline. The volume declines were primarily due to lower demand for chemicals, plastics and lumber, as well as lower shipments of petroleum products resulting from refinery outages. 38 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BNSF (Continued) Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.3 billion in the second quarter and $2.8 billion in the first six months of 2023, a decrease of 6.9% in the second quarter and an increase of 0.8% in the first six months compared to 2022. The second quarter revenue change was attributable to an 8.3% decline in volume, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. The revenue increase in the first six months was primarily due to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 4.9%. The volume decreases were mainly due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of domestic grains, renewable diesel and feedstocks. Operating revenues from coal were $936 million in the second quarter and $2.0 billion in the first six months of 2023, a decrease of 6.3% in the second quarter and an increase of 4.1% in the first six months versus 2022. The revenue decline in the second quarter was attributable to lower volumes of 3.5% and lower average revenue per car/unit. The revenue increase in the first six months was driven by higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 4.0%. The volume decreases derived from moderating demand attributable to lower natural gas prices and weather related impacts. Railroad operating expenses were $3.9 billion in the second quarter and $7.9 billion in the first six months of 2023, a decrease of $186 million (4.6%) in the second quarter and an increase of $106 million (1.4%) in the first six months compared to 2022. The decline in the second quarter of 2023 reflected lower fuel costs, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expenses and general inflation. The increase during the first six months of 2023 reflected increases in all operating expenses, with the exception of fuel costs and purchased services. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 5.0 percentage points to 68.2% in the second quarter and 4.4 percentage points to 68.3% in the first six months of 2023 versus the comparable 2022 periods. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $165 million (13.6%) in the second quarter and $254 million (10.4%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased headcount, wage inflation and lower productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $443 million (34.7%) in the second quarter and $340 million (15.9%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to lower average fuel prices and lower volumes, as well as improved efficiency. Depreciation expense increased $32 million (5.2%) in the second quarter and $53 million (4.3%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to higher capital expenditures. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $80 million (17.4%) in the second quarter and $147 million (14.9%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increases were primarily due to general inflation, increased casualty and litigation costs, higher property and other taxes and lower gains from land and easement sales. BHE We currently own 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“LNG interest”), which BHE consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Other energy businesses include two regulated electricity distribution businesses operated by BHE subsidiaries (referred to as Northern Powergrid) in Great Britain, a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”), a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments and an unregulated retail energy services company. BHE also operates a residential real estate brokerage business and a large network of real estate brokerage franchises in the United States. 39 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BHE (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are largely based on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions).

A summary of net earnings attributable to BHE follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months Percentage Change 2023 2022 2023 2022 Second Quarter First Six Months U.S. utilities $ 430 $ 380 $ 593 $ 780 13.2 % (24.0 )% Natural gas pipelines 187 199 556 521 (6.0 ) 6.7 Other energy businesses 389 411 572 750 (5.4 ) (23.7 ) Real estate brokerage 34 84 — 105 (59.5 ) (100.0 ) Corporate interest and other (167 ) (183 ) (376 ) (388 ) (8.7 ) (3.1 ) $ 873 $ 891 $ 1,345 $ 1,768 (2.0 ) (23.9 ) Our U.S. utilities operate in several states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming (PacifiCorp), Iowa and Illinois (MEC) and Nevada (NV Energy). After-tax earnings increased $50 million (13.2%) in the second quarter and declined $187 million (24.0%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings increase for the second quarter was primarily attributable to higher interest and other income, lower depreciation and amortization expense and increased income tax benefits, partly offset by increases in operations and maintenance expense and interest expense. The earnings decrease in the first six months reflected an increase in operations and maintenance expense of $519 million, including a pre-tax increase in loss accruals, net of expected insurance recoveries, of $344 million associated with the 2020 wildfires, and an increase in interest expense. These items were partially offset by increases in interest and other income, lower depreciation and amortization expense and higher electric utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales), as well as higher income tax benefits. The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2023, relatively unchanged from 2022. Electric utility margin was $3.5 billion in the first six months of 2023, an increase of $60 million (1.7%) versus 2022. The year-to-date increase reflected a variety of changes in operating revenues attributable to rates and volumes and in power generation and purchased costs. Electric retail customer volumes increased 0.1% (up 0.6% at PacifiCorp and 1.3% at MEC and down 1.7% at NV Energy) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to an overall increase in customer usage and in the average number of customers, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather at MEC and NV Energy. 40 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BHE (Continued) After-tax earnings of natural gas pipelines decreased $12 million (6.0%) in the second quarter and increased $35 million (6.7%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in earnings for the first six months reflected higher regulated transportation and storage services revenues from certain general rate cases and favorable interest and other income, partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses and the impact of state income tax reductions in the second quarter of 2022. After-tax earnings of other energy businesses decreased $22 million (5.4%) in the second quarter and $178 million (23.7%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The declines in earnings reflected lower earnings from renewable energy and retail services businesses, primarily attributable to lower income tax benefits and higher operating expenses and the impact of unfavorable changes in valuations of derivatives contracts, partially offset by debt extinguishment gains. Earnings in the first six months of 2023 also included a deferred income tax charge of $82 million recognized in the first quarter related to the enactment of the new Energy Profits Levy income tax in the United Kingdom. After-tax earnings of real estate brokerage decreased $50 million in the second quarter and $105 million in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The decreases reflected lower brokerage services revenues and margins, primarily due to a 26% year-to-date reduction in closed brokerage transaction volumes, as well as lower mortgage services revenues and margins from a 38% year-to-date decrease in closed transaction volumes. These declines were attributable to the impact of rising interest rates, including lower existing home sales and mortgage refinancing demand. Corporate interest and other after-tax losses decreased $16 million in the second quarter and $12 million in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting higher other income, partially offset by lower federal income tax credits recognized and higher BHE corporate interest expense from an April 2022 debt issuance. Pilot Pilot is headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee and operates travel centers in North America (primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J) with more than 650 travel center locations across the U.S. and in six Canadian provinces. Pilot also has over 150 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada where it sells diesel fuel through various arrangements with third party travel centers. A substantial portion of Pilot’s revenues and earnings derive from marketing fuel on a wholesale and retail basis and from other energy-related activities. Through January 31, 2023, we owned a 38.6% interest in Pilot, which we accounted for under the equity method. Our proportionate share of Pilot’s net earnings for the month ending January 31, 2023 and first six months of 2022 are included in equity method earnings in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot, and we currently own an 80% controlling interest. Thus, we began consolidating Pilot’s results of operations in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings on February 1, 2023. Pilot’s earnings for the second quarter of 2023 and the five months ending June 30, 2023 are summarized below (in millions). Second Quarter Five Months Ending 2023 June 30, 2023 Revenues $ 14,754 $ 24,262 Cost of sales 13,600 22,405 Operating and other expenses 855 1,351 Interest expense 113 184 Pre-tax earnings 186 322 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 72 125 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 114 $ 197 41 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Pilot (Continued) Pilot’s revenues and earnings are highly dependent on fuel volumes, prices and margins. Revenues for the second quarter of 2023 and the five months ending June 30, 2023 were $14.8 billion and $24.3 billion, respectively. Pilot’s pre-tax earnings for the second quarter of 2023 and the five months ending June 30, 2023 were $186 million and $322 million, respectively. Operating and other expenses include depreciation and amortization expense of $243 million in the second quarter of 2023 and $411 million in the five months ending June 30, 2023, a significant portion of which derives from property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible asset fair value remeasurements in connection with our application of the acquisition accounting method in 2023. Pilot’s consolidated pre-tax earnings for the second quarter and the first six months of 2023 and 2022 are summarized below. Revenues, costs and expenses for the first six months of 2022 and first month of 2023 are based on Pilot’s historical accounting and are not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, whereas such information for the five months ending June 30, 2023 was included in our Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months Percentage Change 2023 2022 2023 2022 Second Quarter First Six Months Revenues $ 14,754 $ 21,534 $ 29,282 $ 36,001 (31.5 )% (18.7 )% Cost of sales 13,600 20,609 27,099 34,128 (34.0 ) (20.6 ) Operating and other expenses 855 633 1,564 1,238 35.1 26.3 Interest expense 113 51 208 93 121.6 123.7 Pre-tax earnings $ 186 $ 241 $ 411 $ 542 (22.8 ) (24.2 ) Revenues for the first six months of 2023 and 2022 were approximately $29.3 billion and $36.0 billion, respectively. For the first six months of 2023, Pilot sold approximately 9.25 billion gallons of diesel fuel, gasoline and other fuel-related products. Revenues during the first six months of 2023 have been lower than in the corresponding 2022 periods, primarily due to significantly lower fuel prices, as well as from lower fuel sales volumes. Cost of sales in 2022 included significantly higher LIFO inventory charges than in 2023, attributable to the significant increases in fuel prices during the first half of 2022. Interest expense increased $62 million in the second quarter and $115 million in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, due to higher interest rates. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months Percentage Change 2023 2022 2023 2022 Second Quarter First Six Months Revenues Manufacturing $ 19,102 $ 19,772 $ 37,391 $ 38,193 (3.4 )% (2.1 )% Service and retailing 23,024 22,879 46,014 44,509 0.6 3.4 $ 42,126 $ 42,651 $ 83,405 $ 82,702 Pre-tax earnings Manufacturing $ 3,103 $ 3,028 $ 5,714 $ 5,852 2.5 % (2.4 )% Service and retailing 1,391 1,275 2,725 2,492 9.1 9.3 4,494 4,303 8,439 8,344 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,105 1,054 2,068 2,070 Net earnings* $ 3,389 $ 3,249 $ 6,371 $ 6,274 Effective income tax rate 23.9 % 24.0 % 23.8 % 24.3 % Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues 10.7 % 10.1 % 10.1 % 10.1 % * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, primarily related to the amortization of identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings were $174 million in the second quarter and $352 million in the first six months of 2023 and $162 million in the second quarter and $323 million in the first six months of 2022. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page 31 and in the “Other” earnings section on page 48. 42 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of these operations follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2023 2022 2023 2022 Revenues Industrial products $ 8,876 $ 7,714 $ 17,739 $ 15,189 Building products 6,693 7,710 12,703 14,422 Consumer products 3,533 4,348 6,949 8,582 $ 19,102 $ 19,772 $ 37,391 $ 38,193 Pre-tax earnings Industrial products $ 1,520 $ 1,270 $ 2,961 $ 2,486 Building products 1,227 1,307 2,122 2,451 Consumer products 356 451 631 915 $ 3,103 $ 3,028 $ 5,714 $ 5,852 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Industrial products 17.1 % 16.5 % 16.7 % 16.4 % Building products 18.3 % 17.0 % 16.7 % 17.0 % Consumer products 10.1 % 10.4 % 9.1 % 10.7 % Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)) and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Beginning October 19, 2022, this group also includes certain of Alleghany’s businesses consisting of W&W|AFCO Steel, a structural steel fabrication products business, as well as other businesses that were combined into Marmon. Revenues of the industrial products group increased $1.2 billion (15.1%) in the second quarter and $2.6 billion (16.8%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings increased $250 million (19.7%) in the second quarter and $475 million (19.1%) in the first six months of 2023. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 16.7% for the first six months of 2023, an increase of 0.3% compared to the first six months of 2022. Operating results of the group in the first six months of 2023 reflected the impact of business acquisitions and overall improved operating results at our pre-existing businesses. Operating results in 2022 were negatively affected by a combination of higher materials and energy costs, manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages and asset impairment charges, which largely offset the impacts of increased average selling prices and increased demand for certain product categories. PCC’s revenues were $2.3 billion in the second quarter and $4.6 billion in the first six months of 2023, increases of 28.7% in the second quarter and 28.4% in the first six months compared to 2022. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from sales of aerospace products. The revenue increases in 2023 were primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products, while power/energy and general and industrial products also contributed to the overall revenue increases. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 31.5% in the second quarter and 27.3% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The improved results in 2023 reflect the increases in sales and improving manufacturing and operating efficiencies. We continue to strive to improve manufacturing efficiencies, maintain safety and prepare for increasing demand for PCC’s products. Continued growth in PCC’s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace products demand. Lubrizol’s revenues were $1.6 billion in the second quarter and $3.4 billion in the first six months of 2023, a decrease of 5.5% in the second quarter and unchanged in the first six months compared to 2022. Revenues in the first six months of 2023 reflected lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects from the stronger U.S. Dollar, offset by higher average selling prices. Lower sales volumes in 2023 were attributable to general market weakness in the global economy, resulting in lower demand in certain product lines. Sales volumes through the first half of 2022 were restricted by raw material supply constraints and unplanned temporary maintenance shutdowns, which limited Lubrizol’s production capabilities. 43 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings declined 24.6% in the second quarter and 2.8% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 reflect lower insurance recoveries ($89 million) in connection with fires at certain production facilities in 2021 and 2020. Excluding insurance recoveries, earnings were higher due to the favorable impacts of higher selling prices and changes in product mix, partially offset by lower sales volumes, higher raw material costs (primarily in the first quarter), higher operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Marmon’s revenues were $3.1 billion in the second quarter and $6.2 billion in the first six months of 2023, increases of 12.2% in the second quarter and 14.3% in the first six months compared to 2022. Business acquisitions, including AP Emissions Technologies and three former Alleghany businesses: Kentucky Trailer, Wilbert Funeral Services, Inc. and Wilbert Plastics Services, accounted for $301 million and $595 million of comparative revenue increases in the second quarter and first six months of 2023, respectively. In addition, the Rail & Leasing and Crane Services groups generated higher revenues in 2023, due to higher volumes and pricing improvements. The Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration group revenues in 2023 were negatively impacted by lower steel and copper prices. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased 30.6% in the second quarter and 21.8% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings increases attributable to business acquisitions were $26 million in the second quarter and $42 million in the first six months of 2023. Earnings in the second quarter of 2022 included losses of approximately $90 million in the Rail & Leasing group related to the shutdown of its business in Russia. Otherwise, comparative earnings from Marmon’s other business groups in 2023 were mixed, reflecting earnings increases in the Transportation, Water Technologies, and Crane Services groups, which were primarily attributable to revenue growth, and lower earnings in the Electrical group, driven by lower margins in the building wire business. IMC’s revenues were $1.0 billion in the second quarter and $2.0 billion in the first six months of 2023, increases of 10.2% in the second quarter and 7.7% in the first six months compared to 2022. The revenue increases in 2023 reflect increased organic sales in North America, the impact of business acquisitions and higher interest income, partially offset by lower revenues in Asia, unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 15.1% in the second quarter and 9.0% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. In 2023, the impact of revenue increases was partially offset by higher raw material costs, changes in sales mix and the adverse effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Revenues of the building products group decreased $1.0 billion (13.2%) in the second quarter and $1.7 billion (11.9%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings decreased $80 million (6.1%) in the second quarter and $329 million (13.4%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Our building products businesses have benefited in recent years from the low interest rate environment and strong residential and commercial construction markets. The effects of significant increases in home mortgage interest rates in the U.S. over the past year has slowed demand for our home building businesses and our other building products businesses. Such effects have been partially mitigated by new construction activity, resulting from low supplies of pre-existing homes for sale. We continue to anticipate some of our businesses will experience comparative declines in revenues and earnings over the remainder of 2023. Clayton Homes’ revenues declined 16.3% to $2.9 billion in the second quarter and 13.8% to $5.4 billion in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Revenues from home sales decreased $971 million (19.0%) in the first six months of 2023, reflecting lower unit sales, partially offset by slightly higher average selling prices. New home unit sales declined 19.5% in the first six months of 2023, reflecting lower unit sales for factory-built homes (19.2%) and site-built homes (21.1%). We expect unit sales over the remainder of 2023 to be below 2022 levels. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 9.9% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased interest income on higher average loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $22.5 billion as of June 30, 2023, an increase of 12.4% since June 30, 2022. 44 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes declined $72 million (11.5%) in the second quarter and $150 million (13.5%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily attributable to lower earnings from the home building businesses. Earnings from financial services also declined in the first six months of 2023 versus 2022, which were negatively affected by increased expected loan loss provisions and higher insurance claims, partially offset by higher net interest income. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $3.8 billion in the second quarter and $7.3 billion in the first six months of 2023, decreases of $459 million (10.7%) in the second quarter and $860 million (10.5%) in the first six months versus 2022. Comparative revenues were lower at all of our other building products businesses, generally due to lower sales volumes and changes in product mix, partly offset by higher average selling prices. Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses declined slightly (1.2%) in the second quarter and $179 million (13.3%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter increased 1.7 percentage points and in the first six months of 2023 decreased 0.5 percentage points versus 2022. The earnings of our other building products businesses in 2023 were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes and reduced manufacturing efficiencies and benefited from lower average prices for certain raw materials and energy, as well as reduced freight and shipping expenses. The earnings in 2022 benefited from higher selling prices and strong demand in certain product categories and an increase in the gains from a business divestiture and asset sales of $111 million. Consumer products The consumer products group includes recreational vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl), jewelry products (Richline) and beginning October 19, 2022, Jazwares, LLC (Jazwares), a global toy company acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition. Consumer products group revenues decreased $815 million (18.7%) in the second quarter and $1.6 billion (19.0%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The declines reflected lower revenues at Forest River and nearly all of our other consumer products operations, partially offset by the impact of the Jazwares acquisition, which contributed revenues of $378 million in the first six months of 2023. Forest River’s revenues declined 34.2% in the second quarter and 36.4% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting an overall 40.1% decline in unit sales in the first six months and changes in sales mix. Forest River experienced strong recreational vehicle unit sales in recent years and through the first half of 2022. Since then, volumes have declined significantly, attributable in part to the impact of rising interest rates, inflation and other macroeconomic conditions. The sales volume declines for recreational vehicles in 2023 were partially offset by increased bus and commercial business. Revenues of our apparel and footwear businesses declined $155 million (12.8%) in the second quarter and $222 million (9.2%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Revenues from apparel for the first six months of 2023 declined 13.5% from 2022, while revenues from footwear declined 1.8%. The decline in apparel revenue was attributable to continuing sluggish customer demand, partially offset by higher average selling prices and sales mix changes. Duracell’s revenues in first six months of 2023 declined 7.8% versus 2022, primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar. Pre-tax earnings of our consumer products group declined $95 million (21.1%) in the second quarter and $284 million (31.0%) in the first six months of 2023 versus 2022, primarily attributable to lower earnings from Forest River and Duracell. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group decreased 1.6 percentage points in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings from Forest River declined 39.2% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the decrease in unit sales, which reduced manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Apparel and footwear earnings declined 10.7% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Our apparel businesses were negatively affected by lower sales volumes and reduced manufacturing efficiencies. Earnings from Duracell declined in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, due to reduced consumer consumption and market share losses in North America to lower priced brands and to the non-recurring cost and expense reductions in the second quarter of 2022. 45 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2023 2022 2023 2022 Revenues Service $ 5,181 $ 4,737 $ 10,500 $ 9,260 Retailing 4,960 4,880 9,572 9,472 McLane 12,883 13,262 25,942 25,777 $ 23,024 $ 22,879 $ 46,014 $ 44,509 Pre-tax earnings Service $ 824 $ 756 $ 1,661 $ 1,480 Retailing 438 443 822 854 McLane 129 76 242 158 $ 1,391 $ 1,275 $ 2,725 $ 2,492 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Service 15.9 % 16.0 % 15.8 % 16.0 % Retailing 8.8 % 9.1 % 8.6 % 9.0 % McLane 1.0 % 0.6 % 0.9 % 0.6 % Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training services and products to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Beginning October 19, 2022, this group includes IPS-Integrated Project Services, LLC (IPS), a provider of various services in facilities construction management. Service group revenues increased $444 million (9.4%) in the second quarter and $1.2 billion (13.4%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. IPS had revenues of $302 million in the second quarter and $604 million in the first six months of 2023. Revenues from aviation services increased 8.2% in the second quarter and 13.2% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The revenue increases were primarily due to increases in the number of aircraft in shared aircraft ownership programs and in-flight hours across NetJets’ various programs, as well as higher average rates. Revenues from TTI declined 1.0% in the second quarter and increased 2.4% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Excluding the effects of business acquisitions in 2022 and 2023 and the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, year-to-date revenues increased 1.0% in 2023 versus 2022. TTI experienced significant revenue growth in 2021 and much of 2022. Since the third quarter of 2022, new orders have slowed in several regions and markets, in part attributable to elevated customer inventory levels. These conditions are expected to continue and TTI may experience comparative revenue declines over the remainder of 2023. Pre-tax earnings of the service group increased $68 million (9.0%) in the second quarter and $181 million (12.2%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues declined 0.2 percentage points in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings increases were primarily attributable to higher overall margin rates in aviation services businesses, primarily due to a 17% year-to-date increase in average aircraft in the NetJets programs, changes in business mix and the impact of the IPS acquisition. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from TTI (6.4% year-to-date), attributable to lower gross margin rates, higher operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency effects. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), representing 67.6% of our combined retailing revenue in the first six months of 2023. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also offers vehicle service contracts and operates two insurance businesses. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 18.3% of the combined retailing revenues in the first six months of 2023. 46 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailers (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionery products), Pampered Chef (high-quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. Retailing group revenues increased 1.6% in the second quarter and 1.1% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting increases at BHA, partially offset by lower revenues from our other retailers. BHA’s revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 increased 5.3% and 4.5%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. Revenues from new vehicle sales increased 12.8% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022 while revenues from pre-owned vehicle retail sales declined 8.4%. Unit sales in the first six months of 2023 increased 1.5%, reflecting an 8.9% increase in new vehicle sales, partly offset by lower pre-owned vehicles sold. While new vehicle inventory levels remain well below historical levels, vehicle supply continues to gradually rise. Revenues from BHA’s parts/service/repair operations in the first six months of 2023 increased 8.8% versus 2022. Other retailing revenues in the aggregate declined 5.4% in the first six months of 2023 versus 2022, primarily due to lower sales at our home furnishings businesses. Retailing group pre-tax earnings declined $5 million (1.1%) in the second quarter and $32 million (3.7%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 12.7% in the second quarter and 21.1% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. BHA’s earnings increase reflects higher earnings from parts/service/repair and finance/service contract operations and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower vehicle sales margins and higher floor plan interest expense. BHA’s comparative vehicle gross profit margin rates, before the effects of LIFO, peaked in the first half of 2022 and have since been reverting to historical levels. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined $36 million (18.2%) in the second quarter and $127 million (31.8%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a 33.8% decrease in the first six months earnings from the home furnishings businesses, and the impact of a gain in the first quarter of 2022 related to the divestiture of certain jewelry stores. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice distribution businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins and operate in a highly competitive environment. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues declined 2.9% in the second quarter and increased 0.6% in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. Revenues in 2023 of the grocery and the foodservice businesses were negatively affected by lower unit volumes. Grocery sales comprised 61% of McLane’s consolidated sales in the first six months of 2023, with foodservice representing most of the remainder. Pre-tax earnings increased $53 million (69.7%) in the second quarter and $84 million (53.2%) in the first six months of 2023 compared to 2022. The increases in earnings reflects increases in the gross margin rates and lower fuel expenses, partly offset by higher personnel expenses. Non-Controlled Businesses After-tax earnings of our non-controlled businesses include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Occidental Petroleum, Pilot (through January 31, 2023) and Berkadia. After-tax earnings attributable to these businesses increased $353 million in the second quarter and $639 million in the first six months of 2023 versus 2022, primarily due to earnings from Occidental Petroleum and increases in earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz. We adopted the equity method of accounting for our investment in Occidental Petroleum common stock as of August 4, 2022. As of January 31, 2023, Berkshire acquired a controlling interest in Pilot. We applied the equity method through the end of January 2023 on our pre-existing 38.6% interest and began consolidating Pilot’s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements on February 1, 2023. See Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 47 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment and Derivative Contract Gains (Losses) A summary of investment and derivative contract gains (losses) follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2023 2022 2023 2022 Investment gains (losses) $ 33,061 $ (66,854 ) $ 67,819 $ (68,589 ) Derivative contract gains (losses) — (65 ) — (308 ) Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 33,061 (66,919 ) 67,819 (68,897 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 7,192 (13,881 ) 14,511 (14,279 ) Net earnings (loss) $ 25,869 $ (53,038 ) $ 53,308 $ (54,618 ) Effective income tax rate 21.7 % 21.0 % 21.3 % 20.8 % Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Unrealized gains and losses recorded in earnings also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in equity securities of non-U.S. issuers held by our U.S.-based subsidiaries. Pre-tax investment gains and losses included net unrealized gains of $33.0 billion in the second quarter and $63.8 billion in the first six months of 2023 and net unrealized losses of $66.9 billion in the second quarter and $68.5 billion in the first six months of 2022 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Taxable gains and losses on equity securities sold generally represents the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost of the securities sold. Sales of equity securities produced taxable gains of $2.4 billion in the second quarter and $4.6 billion in the first six months of 2023 compared to taxable gains of $76 million in the second quarter and losses of $663 million in the first six months of 2022. Pre-tax investment gains in the first six months of 2023 included a non-cash gain of approximately $3 billion related to the remeasurement of our pre-existing interest in Pilot to fair value through the application of acquisition accounting upon attaining control of Pilot for financial reporting purposes on January 31. We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We also continue to believe the investment gains and losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2023 2022 2023 2022 Acquisition accounting expenses $ (200 ) $ (162 ) $ (402 ) $ (323 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (54 ) (67 ) (118 ) (137 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes 465 1,061 448 1,583 Other earnings 129 80 301 159 $ 340 $ 912 $ 229 $ 1,282 After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate gains pertain to Berkshire’s and BHFC’s Euro, Great Britain Pound and Japanese Yen denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. In 2023 and 2022, we recorded foreign currency exchange rate gains on these debt issues due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, which reduced the U.S Dollar carrying value of the debt. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other earnings consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes. 48 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Our Consolidated Balance Sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Our Consolidated shareholders’ equity at June 30, 2023 was $539.9 billion, an increase of $66.5 billion since December 31, 2022. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $71.4 billion in the first six months of 2023, which included after-tax gains on our investments of $53.3 billion. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities will produce significant volatility in our earnings. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $5.8 billion in the first six months of 2023 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. At June 30, 2023, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $141.9 billion, which included $120.4 billion invested in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stock) were $375.8 billion. During the first six months of 2023, we paid cash of $7.4 billion to acquire equity securities and we received proceeds of $25.8 billion from sales of equity securities. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot for approximately $8.2 billion. Our consolidated borrowings at June 30, 2023 were $125.3 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF, BHE and its subsidiaries and Pilot. During the first six months of 2023, we issued new term debt of approximately $4.0 billion and repaid $7.6 billion on maturing term debt. Berkshire parent company outstanding debt at June 30, 2023 was $17.7 billion, a decrease of $3.7 billion since December 31, 2022. Berkshire repaid $4.3 billion of maturing debt in the first six months of 2023. In April 2023, Berkshire issued ¥164.4 billion (approximately $1.2 billion) of senior notes. Senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, were approximately $18.0 billion at June 30, 2023, substantially unchanged from December 31, 2022. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $24.3 billion as of June 30, 2023, an increase of $854 million from December 31, 2022. In June 2023, BNSF issued $1.6 billion of 5.2% debentures due in 2054. During the first six months of 2023, BNSF repaid approximately $700 million of term debt. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $53.9 billion at June 30, 2023, an increase of $1.1 billion from December 31, 2022. In May 2023, a BHE subsidiary issued $1.2 billion of 5.5% first mortgage bonds due in 2054. During the first six months of 2023, BHE and its subsidiaries repaid approximately $1.4 billion of term debt. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $4.5 billion. Borrowings of Pilot were $5.9 billion as of the January 31, 2023 acquisition date and were $5.8 billion at June 30, 2023. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt or other borrowings issued by BNSF, BHE, Pilot or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates. In the first six months of 2023, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of $21.1 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $8.4 billion in the first six months of 2023, which included capital expenditures by BNSF and BHE of $5.7 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast capital expenditures for BHE and BNSF over the remainder of 2023 will approximate $8.3 billion. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“the 2022 act”) was signed into law. The 2022 act contains numerous provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax on “adjusted financial statement income”, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The provisions of the 2022 act are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. On December 27, 2022, the IRS and Department of Treasury issued initial guidance for taxpayers subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax addressing certain, but not all, issues that need clarification. The IRS and Department of Treasury may release additional guidance in the future. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the 2022 act as more guidance becomes available. We currently do not expect that compliance with the provisions of the 2022 act will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition (Continued) On July 10, 2023, BHE announced that it had executed an agreement to acquire an additional 50% interest in Cove Point LNG, LP, which would increase its ownership interest to 75%. The transaction is valued at $3.3 billion and is subject to applicable regulatory approvals. BHE expects to fund the acquisition with cash on hand. Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were $143.5 billion at June 30, 2023. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of June 30, 2023, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF, aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets and certain raw materials purchase commitments. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2023 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2023 includes estimated liabilities of $143.5 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2023 included goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $85.9 billion, which included $10.6 billion of goodwill associated with the Alleghany and Pilot acquisitions, and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $20.5 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2022. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2022, the estimated fair values of six reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). Our estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $31.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $30.3 billion by 4.0%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the five other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $4.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $4.1 billion by 9.9%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.4 billion. 50 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. As of June 30, 2023, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts and general changes in business conditions, as well as other unanticipated events, on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently anticipate, and we may need to record goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units are inherently subjective and will likely continue to be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of adverse events on a reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates can be subject to wide variations. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. 51 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of June 30, 2023, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Ris k Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. 52 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use o f Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the second quarter of 2023 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program April Class A common stock 177 $ 472,004.70 177 * Class B common stock 220,351 $ 308.57 220,351 * May Class A common stock 238 $ 493,507.36 238 * Class B common stock — $ — — * June Class A common stock 627 $ 506,476.84 627 * Class B common stock 2,134,093 $ 335.55 2,134,093 * * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $30 billion.

General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, the magnitude of gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. To varying degrees, the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to affect our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus and its variants. The development of geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow inflation in recent years have produced varying effects on our operating businesses. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2. New accounting pronouncements We adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2018-12”) as of January 1, 2023, which modifies the accounting, reporting and disclosures related to long duration insurance contracts and most significantly the measurement of our long duration life, annuity and health benefit liabilities. ASU 2018-12 was applied retrospectively to contracts in-force beginning as of January 1, 2021 (the “transition date”). The Consolidated Financial Statements for 2022 and 2021 were revised to reflect the effects of the adoption of ASU 2018-12. As of the transition date, the after-tax impact of changes in cash flow assumptions were recorded in retained earnings and the after-tax effect of changes in discount rates assumptions were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The effects of the adoption of ASU 2018-12 on our Consolidated Financial Statements as of January 1, 2021 and for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 are included in Part II, Item 5 of this Report. Beginning as of January 1, 2021, the cash flow assumptions used in measuring benefit liabilities are reviewed at least annually, with the effects of assumption changes recorded in earnings. Further, the discount rate assumptions used in measuring benefit liabilities are revised each quarterly reporting period based on the prevailing observable upper-medium grade (generally considered to be single A-rated credit ratings) corporate bond yields that reflect the duration characteristics and currency attributes of the liabilities, using interpolation for durations between the observable yields. Changes to benefits liabilities arising from changes in discount rate assumptions are recorded in other comprehensive income. In measuring benefit liabilities and amortizing capitalized acquisition costs under long duration insurance contracts, we generally aggregate contracts by issuance year. ASU 2018-12 also requires certain disclosures for long duration insurance liabilities. See Note 16. 7 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2. New accounting pronouncements (Continued) The effects from adopting ASU 2018-12 on affected line items from our Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 follows in millions, except per share amounts.

Significant business acquisitions Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4 % interest in Pilot Travel Centers, LLC (“Pilot”) for approximately $ 8.2 billion. We previously owned a 38.6 % interest in Pilot and accounted for that investment under the equity method. We now control Pilot for financial reporting purposes. We applied the equity method through the end of January 2023 and began consolidating Pilot’s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements on February 1, 2023. Pilot is headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee and operates travel centers in North America (primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J) with more than 650 travel center locations across 43 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces. Pilot also has over 150 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada where it sells diesel fuel through various arrangements with third party travel centers. Among its business activities, Pilot operates large wholesale fuel and fuel marketing platforms in the U.S. and operates a water hauling and disposal business in the oil fields sector. As Pilot’s most significant business activities include involve purchasing and selling fuel (energy) on a wholesale and retail basis, and engaging in other energy-related business activities, including oil field services, we have included Pilot within the railroad, utilities and energy sections of our Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Earnings beginning February 1, 2023. Pilot’s revenues and net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders included in Berkshire’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the two months ending March 31, 2023 were $ 9.5 billion and $ 83 million, respectively. Our equity method earnings from Pilot for the month of January 2023 were $ 105 million. In applying the acquisition method of accounting, we were required to remeasure our previously held 38.6 % investment in Pilot to fair value. In the first quarter of 2023, we recognized a one-time, non-cash remeasurement gain of approximately $ 3.0 billion, representing the excess of the fair value of that interest over the carrying value under the equity method, as a component of investment gains (losses). 8 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3. Significant business acquisitions ( Continued) Under the terms of an agreement, the holder of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Pilot has the option to require us to redeem for cash, all or a portion of the interest beginning in 2024. The cash consideration will be based on Pilot’s future earnings, cash and debt. We have concluded that the remaining Pilot noncontrolling interest represents a redeemable interest under GAAP and are presenting such interests between liabilities and shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We valued the noncontrolling interest at fair value as of the acquisition date. Thereafter, we will increase or decrease the redeemable noncontrolling interest by the share of the earnings or losses attributable to the interest and will further adjust the balance, as appropriate, if the current estimated redemption value exceeds the carrying value. The preliminary values of the Pilot identified assets acquired, liabilities assumed and redeemable noncontrolling interests are summarized as follows (in millions). Valuations of certain assets and liabilities, including property plant and equipment, other intangible assets and goodwill, as of the acquisition date have not been finalized at this time and are provisional. Pilot Property, plant and equipment $ 8,136 Goodwill and other intangible assets 13,347 Other 6,934 Assets acquired $ 28,417 Notes payable $ 5,876 Other 4,789 Liabilities assumed 10,665 Noncontrolling interests, predominantly redeemable 3,370 Net assets $ 14,382 On October 19, 2022 , Berkshire acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”) for approximately $ 11.5 billion, which included the value of certain Alleghany equity awards, pursuant to a definitive agreement and plan of merger dated as of March 20, 2022 . Alleghany operates a group of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses. It also owns a portfolio of non-financial businesses. A summary of the preliminary values of the Alleghany identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of October 19, 2022 follows (in millions). Valuations of certain assets, such as intangible assets and goodwill, and certain liabilities as of the acquisition date have not been finalized at this time and are provisional.

Investments in equity securities (Continued) During 2022, we began to acquire common stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”). Our aggregate voting interest in Occidental exceeded 20 % on August 4, 2022 and we adopted the equity method as of that date. See Note 6. We report our investments in Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock and Occidental common stock warrants at fair value as equity securities, as such interests are not in-substance common stock under GAAP and are not eligible for the equity method. As of March 31, 2023, our investment in Occidental preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation value of approximately $ 9.5 billion. During March of 2023, Occidental issued mandatory redemption notifications at a price of 110 % of the liquidation value, plus accrued and unpaid dividends for $ 474 million of preferred stock liquidation value due to excess distributions by Occidental to its common stockholders, as defined under the agreement. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8 % per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. Our investment in Occidental warrants allows us to purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $ 59.62 per share. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. As of March 31, 2023, we owned 151.6 million shares of American Express Company (“American Express”) common stock representing 20.4 % of the American Express outstanding common stock. Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors. We have also agreed to passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we do not use the equity method with respect to our investment in American Express common stock and we continue to record our investment at fair value. Note 6. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these are our investments in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”) and Occidental. We own 26.5 % of Kraft Heinz common stock and we own 23.5 % of Occidental common stock, which excludes the potential effect of the exercise of the Occidental common stock warrants that are included in investments in equity securities. Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Occidental is an international energy company, whose activities include oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and chemicals manufacturing businesses. Occidental’s midstream businesses purchase, market, gather, process, transport and store various oil, natural gas, carbon dioxide and other products. Occidental’s financial information is not available in time for concurrent reporting in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, we report the equity method effects for Occidental on a one-quarter lag. Our earnings in the first quarter of 2023 included our share of Occidental’s earnings from its fourth quarter of 2022. The common stock of Kraft Heinz and Occidental are publicly traded. The fair values and carrying values of these investments in addition to the carrying values of our other significant equity method investments are summarized as follows (in millions). Carrying Value Fair Value March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Kraft Heinz $ 13,033 $ 12,937 $ 12,585 $ 13,249 Occidental 12,927 11,484 13,217 12,242 Other 443 3,629 $ 26,403 $ 28,050 Our other significant equity method investments included Pilot through January 31, 2023. Beginning February 1, 2023, we ceased accounting for Pilot under the equity method and began consolidating Pilot for financial reporting purposes. Our investment in Pilot under the equity method was $ 3.2 billion at December 31, 2022. Other significant equity method investments also included our 50 % interest in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”) with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50 % interest. Berkadia provides capital solutions, investment sales advisory and mortgage servicing for multifamily and commercial real estate. Berkadia’s commercial paper borrowing capacity (currently limited to $ 1.5 billion) is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. The carrying values of our investments in Kraft Heinz and Berkadia approximate our share of the net equity of each of these entities. The carrying value of our investment in Occidental common stock exceeded our share of its shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2022 by approximately $ 8 billion. Based upon the limited information available to us, we concluded the excess represents goodwill. 11 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 6. Equity method investments (Continued) Our earnings and distributions received from equity method investments are summarized in the table below (in millions). As previously indicated, we are reporting the equity method effects for Occidental on a one-quarter lag. Thus, the earnings we recorded in the first quarter of 2023 related to Occidental’s earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022. Equity method earnings attributable to Pilot were $ 105 million for the month ending January 31, 2023 and $ 107 million for the first quarter of 2022.

Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 are summarized as follows (in millions). First Quarter 2023 2022 Investment gains (losses): Equity securities: Change in unrealized investment gains (losses) during the period on securities held at the end of the period $ 31,317 $ ( 1,775 ) Investment gains on securities sold during the period 370 89 31,687 ( 1,686 ) Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains 124 6 Gross realized losses ( 52 ) ( 49 ) Other 2,999 ( 6 ) Investment gains (losses) 34,758 ( 1,735 ) Derivative contract gains (losses) — ( 243 ) $ 34,758 $ ( 1,978 ) 12 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7. Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) (Continued) Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the period. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $ 13.3 billion in the first quarter of 2023 and $ 9.7 billion in the first quarter of 2022. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the period represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable period or, if later, the purchase date. Taxable gains and losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Equity securities sold produced taxable gains of $ 2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to taxable losses of $ 739 million in 2022. Other investment gains in the first quarter of 2023 included approximately $ 3 billion from the remeasurement of our pre-existing 38.6 % interest in Pilot through the application of acquisition accounting under GAAP. See Note 3. As of March 31, 2023, our exposure to losses in the future under our two outstanding equity index put option contracts is insignificant. Note 8.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 15), for each of the three-month periods ending March 31, 2023 and 2022 follows (in millions). 2023 2022 Balances at beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 107,472 $ 86,664 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 5,025 ) ( 2,960 ) Net liabilities 102,447 83,704 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year 14,776 13,375 Prior accident years ( 740 ) ( 251 ) Total 14,036 13,124 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year ( 3,841 ) ( 3,908 ) Prior accident years ( 9,747 ) ( 8,091 ) Total ( 13,588 ) ( 11,999 ) Foreign currency effect 93 ( 106 ) Balances at March 31: Net liabilities 102,988 84,723 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 4,969 2,944 Gross liabilities $ 107,957 $ 87,667 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. In the first quarter, we recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 740 million in 2023 and $ 251 million in 2022, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 0.7 % in 2023 and 0.3 % in 2022. We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of primary insurance businesses in the first quarter by $ 379 million in 2023 and $ 114 million in 2022. In 2023, the reductions were driven by private passenger auto claims, whereas the decreases in 2022 were primarily attributable to private passenger auto, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims, partly offset by increases with respect to other casualty claims. In the first quarter, estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of property and casualty reinsurance businesses were reduced $ 361 million in 2023 and $ 137 million in 2022. 17 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for each of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 follow (in millions). 2023 2022 Balances at beginning of year $ 35,415 $ 37,855 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current year contracts — — Prior years’ contracts 14 ( 7 ) Total 14 ( 7 ) Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 372 ) ( 547 ) Foreign currency effect 6 ( 5 ) Balances at March 31 $ 35,063 $ 37,296 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses above $ 14 $ ( 7 ) Deferred charge amortization and adjustments 171 215 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings $ 185 $ 208 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposure to losses began. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include changes in estimated liabilities and related deferred charge asset amortization and adjustments arising from the changes in estimated timing and amount of future loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $ 9.7 billion at March 31, 2023 and $ 10.4 billion at March 31, 2022. Note 16.

We also reinsure closed blocks of guaranteed minimum death and living benefits associated with variable annuity products, referred to as market risk benefits. Such liabilities are included in other policyholder liabilities and are measured at estimated fair value under ASU 2018-12. Such liabilities were approximately $ 1.2 billion as of March 31, 2023 and $ 1.25 billion as of December 31, 2022. During the first quarter of 2023, we reduced liability estimates by $ 65 million, for the effects of changes in securities markets, interest rates and other inputs used to estimate liabilities. Cash settlements during the first quarter of 2023 were insignificant. Note 17. Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings of our insurance and other businesses are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges are based on borrowings as of March 31, 2023.

Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) In the first quarter of 2023, Berkshire repaid approximately $ 3.9 billion of maturing senior notes. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. In April 2023, Berkshire issued ¥ 164.4 billion (approximately $ 1.2 billion) of senior notes and repaid ¥ 56.3 billion of maturing senior notes. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. Berkshire also guarantees certain debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $ 2.7 billion at March 31, 2023. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 6.85 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 1,029 billion par at March 31, 2023) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates produced pre-tax losses of $ 26 million in the first quarter of 2023 and pre-tax gains of $ 716 million in the first quarter of 2022. Notes payable and other borrowings of our railroad, utilities and energy businesses are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges are based on borrowings as of March 31, 2023. Weighted Average Interest Rate March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2023 - 2053 4.4 % $ 13,597 $ 13,996 Subsidiary and other debt due 2023 - 2064 4.3 % 37,553 37,639 Short-term borrowings 5.6 % 1,819 1,119 Pilot Travel Centers (“Pilot”) and subsidiaries: Pilot borrowings due 2023 - 2028 6.6 % 5,878 — Short-term borrowings 6.2 % 594 — Burlington Northern Santa Fe (“BNSF”) and subsidiaries due 2023 - 2097 4.6 % 22,747 23,452 $ 82,188 $ 76,206 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. Pilot’s borrowings primarily represent syndicated loans. BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. As of March 31, 2023, BNSF, Pilot, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE, Pilot or their subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries have unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $ 13.1 billion at March 31, 2023, which included approximately $ 9.0 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 21 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 18. Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, other receivables and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of or otherwise approximate the fair values.

Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 follow (in millions).

These investments are private placements with contractual terms that restrict transfers and currently prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of liquidity and subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. 23 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19. Common stock Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the first quarter of 2023 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Class A, $ 5 Par Value ( 1,650,000 shares authorized) Class B, $ 0.0033 Par Value ( 3,225,000,000 shares authorized) Issued Treasury Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding Balances at December 31, 2022 651,450 ( 59,886 ) 591,564 1,509,969,352 ( 207,715,276 ) 1,302,254,076 Conversions of Class A to Class B common stock ( 359 ) — ( 359 ) 538,500 — 538,500 Treasury stock acquired — ( 5,103 ) ( 5,103 ) — ( 6,716,864 ) ( 6,716,864 ) Balances at March 31, 2023 651,091 ( 64,989 ) 586,102 1,510,507,852 ( 214,432,140 ) 1,296,075,712 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,450,152 shares outstanding as of March 31, 2023 and 1,459,733 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth ( 1/1,500 ) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth ( 1/1,500 ) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times the average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $ 30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note 20. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were 20.1 % in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 18.0 % in the first quarter of 2022. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in certain equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, including investment gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. 24 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 21.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 25 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 24.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines and marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. We acquired control of Pilot Travel Centers (“Pilot”) on January 31, 2023. Pilot’s revenues, costs and earnings are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements and is considered a reportable segment beginning February 1, 2023. In this presentation, the revenues and pre-tax earnings of the Pilot segment are for the two months ending March 31, 2023. Previously, our earnings from Pilot were determined under the equity method and are included in earnings from equity method investments. Revenues and earnings before income taxes by segment for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions).

The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. To varying degrees the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to affect our operating businesses. Government and private sector actions were taken beginning in 2020 intended to control the spread and mitigate the adverse economic effects of the virus and its variants. The development of global geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow inflation in recent years has produced varying economic effects on our operating businesses. We cannot reliably predict the future economic effects of these events on our businesses. Insurance underwriting generated after-tax earnings of $911 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $167 million in the first quarter of 2022, which was revised from the previously reported amount of $47 million as a result of the adoption of ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023. See Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased $799 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, mostly attributable to increases in short-term interest rates. After-tax earnings of BNSF decreased 9.0% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The comparative decrease was primarily attributable to lower overall freight volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs. After-tax earnings of BHE decreased 46.3% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease reflected lower earnings from the U.S. regulated utilities, other energy businesses and real estate brokerage businesses. As disclosed in Note 3 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, we increased our ownership in Pilot from 38.6% to 80% on January 31, 2023 and we are consolidating Pilot’s results beginning February 1, 2023. In 2022 and through January 31, 2023, earnings from Pilot on our 38.6% interest were determined under the equity method and are included in non-controlled businesses in the preceding table. After-tax earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses decreased 1.4% in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2022. Earnings in the first quarter of 2023 were mixed among our various businesses. While results for certain industrial products manufacturers and services businesses improved versus 2022, the results of the building and consumer products businesses generally deteriorated. Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022 predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment gains and losses on investments in equity securities, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) also included an after-tax non-cash remeasurement gain of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023 related to our previously held 38.6% interest in Pilot through the application of the acquisition accounting method. 28 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (Continued) Other earnings included after-tax foreign exchange rate losses of $17 million in the first quarter of 2023 and after-tax gains of $522 million in the first quarter of 2022 related to the non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett, and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the quarterly or annual operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. We currently consider pre-tax incurred losses exceeding $150 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophes in the first quarter were Cyclone Gabrielle and floods in New Zealand in 2023 and floods in Australia in 2022. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $143 billion as of March 31, 2023. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S.-based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). Berkshire acquired Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”) on October 19, 2022. Through its subsidiaries, Alleghany operates property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses, which are included in the BH Primary and BHRG underwriting results. We strive to produce pre-tax underwriting earnings (premiums earned less insurance losses/benefits incurred and underwriting expenses) over the long term in all business categories, except for BHRG’s retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts. Time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing prices for these contracts. We normally receive all premiums at the contract inception date, which are immediately available for investment. Ultimate claim payments can extend for decades and are expected to exceed premiums, producing underwriting losses over the claim settlement periods, primarily through deferred charge asset amortization and discounted liability accretion charges. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). BHRG’s pre-tax underwriting earnings for the first quarter of 2022 were $301 million, an increase from the previously reported amount of $156 million due to the impact of the retrospective adoption of ASU 2018-12 with respect to our long duration insurance contracts. First Quarter 2023 2022 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss): GEICO $ 703 $ (178 ) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 268 92 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 231 301 Pre-tax underwriting earnings 1,202 215 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 291 48 Net underwriting earnings $ 911 $ 167 Effective income tax rate 24.3 % 22.8 % 29 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO GEICO primarily writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2023 2022 Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 10,060 $ 10,265 Premiums earned $ 9,626 100.0 $ 9,554 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 7,992 83.0 8,544 89.4 Underwriting expenses 931 9.7 1,188 12.5 Total losses and expenses 8,923 92.7 9,732 101.9 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ 703 $ (178 ) GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first quarter of 2023 reflected higher average premiums per auto policy, a reduction in advertising costs, as well as favorable prior accident year development. Premiums written in the first quarter of 2023 decreased $205 million (2.0%) compared to the first quarter of 2022. Premiums earned increased $72 million (0.8%) as average premiums per auto policy increased 15.2% due to rate increases, offset by a decrease in policies-in-force of 2.4 million (13.0%) since March 31, 2022. GEICO significantly reduced advertising over that period, which contributed to the reduction in policies-in-force. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter of 2023 decreased $552 million (6.5%) compared to the first quarter of 2022. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned in the first quarter of 2023 was 83.0%, a decrease of 6.4 percentage points compared to the first quarter of 2022, which reflected the impact of higher average premiums per auto policy, favorable reserve development for prior accident years, the reduction in policies-in-force, and lower claims frequencies. Somewhat offsetting the favorable impact of these items were increases in claims severities. GEICO’s reductions in the ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events were $338 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $92 million in the first quarter of 2022. The reduction in loss estimates for prior years’ events in 2023 reflected decreased estimates across several coverages. Claims frequencies in the first quarter of 2023 were lower for property damage (five to six percent range) and collision (six to seven percent range), while claims frequencies increased for bodily injury (four to five percent range) and personal injury (three to four percent range). Average claims severities in the first quarter of 2023 were higher for property damage coverage (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range), collision coverage (seven to eight percent range) and bodily injury coverage (eight to ten percent range). Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2023 were $931 million, a decrease of $257 million (21.6%) compared to 2022. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in the first quarter of 2023 was 9.7% compared to 12.5% in 2022. These decreases were driven by the reduction in advertising expenses. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group consists of several independently managed businesses that provide a variety of primarily commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary’s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”), Berkshire Hathaway Direct Insurance Company (“BH Direct”) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”). This group also includes Alleghany’s RSUI Group Inc. and CapSpecialty, Inc. (“Alleghany Insurance”), beginning October 19, 2022. 30 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2023 2022 Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 4,158 $ 3,392 Premiums earned $ 3,961 100.0 $ 3,118 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 2,656 67.1 2,274 72.9 Underwriting expenses 1,037 26.1 752 24.1 Total losses and expenses 3,693 93.2 3,026 97.0 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 268 $ 92 Premiums written increased $766 million (22.6%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Alleghany Insurance ($570 million), as well as increased volumes from BH Specialty, BH Direct and USLI. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $382 million (16.8%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the impact of Alleghany Insurance ($233 million). BH Primary’s loss ratio decreased 5.8 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting changes in business mix (including the impact of Alleghany Insurance), lower incurred losses from current year catastrophes and increased reductions in loss estimates for prior years’ events. Incurred losses from significant catastrophes during the first quarter were $37 million in 2023 and $75 million in 2022. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $41 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $22 million in the first quarter of 2022. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of workers’ compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Claims liabilities could be greater than anticipated due to a variety of factors. Underwriting expenses increased $285 million (37.9%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Alleghany Insurance underwriting expenses for the first quarter of 2023 were $139 million. Underwriting expenses as percentages of premiums earned increased 2.0 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to changes in business mix. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and, beginning October 19, 2022, Alleghany’s Transatlantic Reinsurance Company and affiliates (“TransRe Group”). We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO and we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (in millions). Pre-tax underwriting losses in the first quarter of 2022 were increased $14 million for the life and health business and $16 million for the periodic payment annuity business, while earnings from the variable annuity business were increased $175 million from the previously reported amounts due to the retrospective adoption of ASU 2018-12. First Quarter Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Property/casualty $ 5,149 $ 3,399 $ 390 $ 405 Life/health 1,060 1,248 137 (26 ) Retroactive reinsurance — — (195 ) (190 ) Periodic payment annuity — 169 (164 ) (119 ) Variable annuity — — 63 231 $ 6,209 $ 4,816 $ 231 $ 301 31 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Property/casualty A summary of property/casualty reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2023 2022 Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 6,268 $ 4,386 Premiums earned $ 5,149 100.0 $ 3,399 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 3,387 65.8 2,307 67.9 Underwriting expenses 1,372 26.6 687 20.2 Total losses and expenses 4,759 92.4 2,994 88.1 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 390 $ 405 Premiums written in the first quarter of 2023 included $1.3 billion from the inclusion of TransRe Group. Otherwise, premiums written increased $542 million (12.4%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to net increases in new and renewal property business and higher rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $1.1 billion (46.8%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily from the inclusion of TransRe Group ($700 million). The loss ratio decreased 2.1 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Losses incurred from significant catastrophes during the first quarter were $407 million in 2023 and $315 million in 2022. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ events of $361 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $137 million in the first quarter of 2022. The expense ratio increased 6.4 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange rate effects and changes in business mix, including the impact of TransRe Group. Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2023 included $385 million related to TransRe Group. Underwriting expenses also included foreign currency exchange losses of $74 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to gains of $81 million in the first quarter of 2022, related to the remeasurement of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2023 2022 Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 1,061 $ 1,243 Premiums earned $ 1,060 100.0 $ 1,248 100.0 Life and health insurance benefits 678 64.0 1,061 85.0 Underwriting expenses 245 23.1 213 17.1 Total benefits and expenses 923 87.1 1,274 102.1 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ 137 $ (26 ) Pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first quarter of 2023 reflected the impact of life insurance contract commutations in 2023, as well as lower claims incurred compared to the first quarter of 2022. The life insurance contract commutations drove most of the comparative decreases in premiums earned and life and health benefits incurred. Retroactive reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance underwriting results primarily derive from the runoff of contracts written several years ago. Pre-tax underwriting losses in each period derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting losses were $195 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $190 million in the first quarter of 2022, primarily related to deferred charge amortization. The effects of foreign currency exchange were relatively insignificant in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022. 32 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance (Continued) Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $35.1 billion at March 31, 2023, a decline of $352 million since December 31, 2022, primarily attributable to paid claims. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $9.7 billion at March 31, 2023, a decline of $171 million since December 31, 2022. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. Our periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses from the recurring accretion of time-value discounted annuity liabilities, which includes discount accruals on liabilities of contracts without life contingencies. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency losses of $19 million in the first quarter of 2023 and gains of $23 million in the first quarter of 2022. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $145 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $142 million in the first quarter of 2022. Discounted liabilities were $15.1 billion at March 31, 2023, which included $4.0 billion for contracts without life contingencies. We adopted ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023. ASU 2018-12 requires that the discount rates on contracts with life-contingent liabilities be adjusted quarterly based upon prevailing interest rates. The effects of discount rate changes are reflected in other comprehensive income. Variable annuity The run-off of our variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax gains of $63 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $231 million in the first quarter of 2022. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter Percentage 2023 2022 Change Dividend income $ 1,244 $ 1,197 3.9 % Interest and other investment income 1,141 164 595.7 Pre-tax net investment income 2,385 1,361 75.2 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 416 191 Net investment income $ 1,969 $ 1,170 Effective income tax rate 17.4 % 14.1 % Dividend income increased 3.9% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Income in the first quarter included $8 million in 2023 and $16 million in 2022 from BHE preferred stock. Such amounts were deducted from earnings of the BHE segment. Dividend income varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Interest and other investment income increased $977 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increases in short-term interest rates. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. 33 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $165 billion at March 31, 2023 and $164 billion at December 31, 2022. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023 and, consequently, the average cost of float was negative. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 follows (in millions). March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills $ 93,627 $ 86,816 Equity securities 319,466 298,934 Fixed maturity securities 22,438 24,998 Other 2,501 3,417 $ 438,032 $ 414,165 Fixed maturity securities as of March 31, 2023 were as follows (in millions).

BNSF Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with over 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped including consumer products, industrial products, agricultural products and coal. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2023 2022 Railroad operating revenues $ 5,888 $ 5,777 Railroad operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 1,313 1,224 Fuel 964 861 Purchased services 511 499 Depreciation and amortization 645 624 Equipment rents, materials and other 593 526 Total 4,026 3,734 Railroad operating earnings 1,862 2,043 Other revenues (expenses): Other revenues 131 191 Other expenses, net (87 ) (170 ) Interest expense (257 ) (255 ) Pre-tax earnings 1,649 1,809 Income taxes 402 438 Net earnings $ 1,247 $ 1,371 Effective income tax rate 24.4 % 24.2 % 34 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BNSF (Continued) The following table summarizes BNSF’s railroad freight volumes by business group (cars/units in thousands). Cars/Units First Quarter Percentage 2023 2022 Change Consumer products 1,066 1,275 (16.4 )% Industrial products 389 404 (3.7 ) Agricultural products 300 305 (1.6 ) Coal 369 385 (4.2 ) 2,124 2,369 (10.3 ) Railroad operating revenues increased 1.9% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily attributable to a 14.0% increase in average revenue per car/unit resulting from higher fuel surcharge revenue driven by higher fuel prices and increased rates per car/unit, partially offset by a 10.3% decrease in unit volume. BNSF’s pre-tax earnings were $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an 8.8% decrease compared to 2022. Operating revenues from consumer products were $1.9 billion in the first quarter, a 10.4% decrease from 2022, attributable to 16.4% lower volumes, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower intermodal shipments resulting from lower west coast imports and the loss of an intermodal customer, partially offset by an increase in automotive volume from higher vehicle production. Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023, a 6.4% increase from 2022, primarily due to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a 3.7% decrease in volumes. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower demand for chemicals and plastics, lumber and paper shipments. Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an 8.8% increase compared to 2022, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in volumes. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of domestic grains, renewable diesel and feedstocks. Operating revenues from coal were $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2023, a 15.7% increase from 2022. The increase was attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by lower volumes of 4.2%. The volume decrease derived from weather related impacts and moderating demand due to lower natural gas prices. Railroad operating expenses were $4.0 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of $292 million (7.8%) compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to increases in the cost of fuel, as well as higher compensation and benefits expenses. Our ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues in the first quarter of 2023 increased 3.8 percentage points to 68.4% versus 2022. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $89 million (7.3%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased headcount, wage inflation, and lower productivity. Fuel expenses increased $103 million (12.0%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to higher average fuel prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Purchased services expenses increased $12 million (2.4%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to general inflation. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $67 million (12.7%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to general inflation, increased casualty and litigation costs and higher property and other miscellaneous taxes. 35 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BHE We currently own 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“LNG interest”), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Other energy businesses include two regulated electricity distribution businesses operated by BHE subsidiaries (referred to as Northern Powergrid) in Great Britain, a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”), a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments and an unregulated retail energy services company. BHE also operates a residential real estate brokerage business and a large network of real estate brokerage franchises in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions).

The discussion of BHE’s operating results that follows is based on after-tax earnings, reflecting how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated. A summary of net earnings attributable to BHE follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter Percentage 2023 2022 Change U.S. utilities $ 163 $ 400 (59.3 )% Natural gas pipelines 369 322 14.6 Other energy businesses 183 339 (46.0 ) Real estate brokerage (34 ) 21 (261.9 ) Corporate interest and other (209 ) (205 ) 2.0 $ 472 $ 877 (46.2 ) 36 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BHE (Continued) Our U.S. utilities operate in several states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming (PacifiCorp), Iowa and Illinois (MEC) and Nevada (NV Energy). After-tax earnings decreased $237 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings decrease reflected higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher electric utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales), higher other income and lower state income taxes. Operating expenses increased primarily due to a pre-tax increase of $359 million in loss accruals (net of expected insurance recoveries) associated with the 2020 wildfires, as well as from increases in general and plant maintenance costs. The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of $62 million (3.8%) compared to the first quarter of 2022. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from favorable retail and wholesale pricing and increases in retail customer volumes, partially offset by increases in thermal generation and purchased power costs and lower wholesale volumes. Retail customer volumes increased 2.6% (3.3% at PacifiCorp, 1.0% at MEC and 2.9% at NV Energy) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to increases in customer usage and in the average number of customers. After-tax earnings of natural gas pipelines increased $47 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher regulated transportation and storage services revenues from certain general rate cases. After-tax earnings of other energy businesses decreased $156 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a deferred income tax charge of $82 million recognized in March 2023 related to the enactment of a new Energy Profits Levy income tax in the United Kingdom, lower earnings from changes in unrealized positions on derivative contracts and unfavorable results from natural gas, solar and geothermal generating facilities due to increased maintenance costs and lower solar generation due to weather events in California. Partially offsetting these earnings decreases were increased wind tax equity investment earnings of $36 million. After-tax earnings of real estate brokerage decreased $55 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. The decrease reflected lower brokerage services revenues and margins, primarily due to a 29% reduction in closed brokerage transaction volumes, as well as lower mortgage services revenues and margins from a 41% decrease in closed transaction volumes, attributable to the impact of rising interest rates and a corresponding slowdown in home sales. Pilot On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot Travel Centers, LLC (“Pilot”), and we currently own an 80% controlling interest. Thus, we began consolidating Pilot’s results of operations in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings on February 1, 2023. Through January 31, 2023, we owned a 38.6% interest in Pilot, which we accounted for under the equity method. Our proportionate share of Pilot’s net earnings for the month ending January 31, 2023 and first quarter 2022 are included in equity method earnings in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Pilot is headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee and operates travel centers in North America (primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J) with more than 650 travel center locations across the U.S. and in six Canadian provinces. Pilot also has over 150 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada where it sells diesel fuel through various arrangements with third party travel centers. A substantial portion of Pilot’s revenues and earnings derive from marketing fuel on a wholesale and retail basis and from other energy-related activities. Our earnings from Pilot for the two months ending March 31, 2023 are summarized below (in millions). Two months ending March 31, 2023 Revenues $ 9,508 Cost of sales 8,805 Operating and other expenses 496 Interest expense 71 Pre-tax earnings 136 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 53 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 83 37 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Pilot (Continued) Pilot’s revenues and earnings are highly dependent on fuel, prices and margins. Revenues for the two months ending March 31, 2023 were $9.5 billion. Revenues for the first three months of 2023 and 2022 were approximately $14.5 billion and $13.9 billion, respectively. For the first quarter of 2023, Pilot sold approximately 4.7 billion gallons of diesel fuel, gasoline and other fuel-related products. Pilot’s pre-tax earnings for the two months ending March 31, 2023 were $136 million. Operating and other expenses included depreciation and amortization expense of $168 million, a significant portion of which derived from depreciation of property, plant and equipment assets and amortization of intangible assets that were remeasured to fair value in connection with the application of the acquisition accounting method in 2023. Fuel prices and margins were elevated in 2022 and remained elevated during the first quarter of 2023. Pilot’s consolidated pre-tax earnings for the three months ending March 31, 2023 and 2022 are summarized below. Revenues, costs and expenses for the first quarter of 2022 and first month of 2023 are based on Pilot’s historical accounting and are not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, whereas such information for the two months ending March 31, 2023 was included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Dollars are in millions.

The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings were $202 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $161 million in the first quarter of 2022. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page 28 and in the “Other” earnings section on page 44. 38 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of these operations follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2023 2022 Revenues Industrial products $ 8,863 $ 7,475 Building products 6,010 6,712 Consumer products 3,416 4,234 $ 18,289 $ 18,421 Pre-tax earnings Industrial products $ 1,441 $ 1,216 Building products 895 1,144 Consumer products 275 464 $ 2,611 $ 2,824 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Industrial products 16.3 % 16.3 % Building products 14.9 % 17.0 % Consumer products 8.1 % 11.0 % Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)) and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Beginning October 19, 2022, this group also includes businesses acquired in connection with Alleghany consisting of the structural steel fabrication products business conducted through W&W|AFCO Steel, as well as other businesses that became part of Marmon. Revenues of the industrial products group increased $1.4 billion (18.6%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022 and pre-tax earnings increased $225 million (18.5%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 16.3% for the first quarters of 2023 and 2022. Operating results of the group in the first quarter of 2023 reflected the impact of business acquisitions and overall improved operating results at our pre-existing businesses. PCC’s revenues were $2.25 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 28.1% compared to 2022. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from sales of aerospace products. The revenue increase in 2023 was primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products, while power/energy and general and industrial products also contributed to the overall revenue increase. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 23.0% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Results in 2023 reflected improving manufacturing and operating efficiencies. We are continuing to strive to improve manufacturing efficiencies, maintain safety and prepare for increasing demand for PCC’s products. Continued growth in PCC’s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace products demand. Lubrizol’s revenues were approximately $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 5.2% compared to 2022. The revenue increase reflected higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects from the stronger U.S. Dollar. Lower sales volumes in the first quarter of 2023 were attributable to general market weakness in the global economy, resulting in lower demand in certain product lines. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings increased 34.7% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings in 2023 were favorably impacted by higher selling prices and favorable product mix, partially offset by the continued rise of raw material costs, lower sales volumes, higher operating expenses, and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. 39 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Marmon’s revenues were $3.1 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 16.4% compared to 2022. Business acquisitions including AP Emissions Technologies and three former Alleghany businesses: Kentucky Trailer, Wilbert Funeral Services, Inc. and Wilbert Plastics Services, accounted for nearly 70% of the growth. Nearly all of Marmon’s business groups generated higher revenues in 2023, led by significant increases in the Rail & Leasing, Transportation, Metal Services and Crane groups, due to higher volumes and pricing improvements. Our Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups faced headwinds in revenue in 2023 attributed to lower steel and copper prices and slowing residential construction activity. Our international businesses were challenged by foreign currency translations as a result of the stronger U.S. Dollar. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2023 increased 13.5% compared to 2022, with business acquisitions accounting for 27% of the increase. Most of Marmon’s business groups generated higher comparative first quarter earnings in 2023, led by the Transportation group, as well as from the Water Technologies, Retail Solutions, Metals Services and Crane Services groups, primarily attributable to revenue growth. The first quarter earnings increase was partly offset by lower earnings in the Electrical group driven by falling demand and compressing margins in the building wire business and the Rail & Leasing group attributable to higher repair costs and lower railcar disposal gains. IMC’s revenues were $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 5.2% compared to 2022. Revenues in 2023 reflected increased organic sales in North America and from business acquisitions, partially offset by lower revenues in Asia, unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 3.5% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The impact of higher revenues was partially offset by higher raw material costs, changes in sales mix and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Revenues of the building products group decreased $702 million (10.5%) in the first quarter of 2023 and pre-tax earnings decreased $249 million (21.8%) compared to 2022. Our building products businesses have benefited in recent years from the low interest rate environment and strong residential and commercial construction markets. The effects of significant increases in interest rates, including home mortgage interest rates in the U.S. over the past year, has slowed demand for our home building businesses and certain of our other building products businesses. As such, our businesses are likely to experience declines in comparative revenues and earnings over the remainder of 2023. Clayton Homes’ revenues decreased 10.7% to $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Revenues from home sales decreased $353 million (15.8%) in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting lower unit sales partially offset by higher average selling prices. New home unit sales decreased 18.0% in the first quarter of 2023, including a 16.9% decrease in factory-built manufactured homes and a 23.1% decrease in site-built home unit sales. We expect unit sales will continue to remain below 2022 in the near term. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 8.8% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $21.8 billion as of March 31, 2023, an increase of 2.3% from December 31, 2022. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes decreased $78 million (16.1%) in the first quarter 2023 compared to 2022, primarily attributable to lower sales volumes. Earnings from financial services declined 9.3% in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2022, reflecting increased expected loan loss provisions and higher operating and interest expenses. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of $401 million (10.3%) versus 2022. Comparative revenues were lower at all our other building products businesses, generally due to lower sales volumes, partly offset by higher average prices. Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses decreased $170 million (25.8%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of 2023 decreased 2.9 percentage points versus 2022. Earnings in 2023 at certain of our businesses were negatively impacted by lower sales and reduced gross sales margins. Earnings in 2022 benefitted from higher selling prices and strong demand in certain product categories, as well as a pre-tax gain from a business divestiture of $94 million. 40 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Consumer products The consumer products group includes recreational vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl), jewelry products (Richline) and beginning October 19, 2022, Jazwares, LLC (Jazwares), a global toy company acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition. Consumer products group revenues decreased $818 million (19.3%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The decline reflected lower revenues at Forest River and certain of our apparel and footwear operations, partially offset by the impact of the Jazwares acquisition. Forest River’s revenues declined 38.6% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting an overall 44% decline in unit sales. Forest River experienced strong unit sales in recent years and through the first half of 2022. Since then, volumes have declined, attributable in part to the impact of rising interest rates, inflation and other macroeconomic conditions. Revenues of our apparel and footwear businesses declined $68 million (5.7%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting lower revenues from apparel (12.1%), partly offset by higher revenues from footwear. The decline in apparel revenue was driven by lower volume, as order delays and cancellations persisted in response to the elevated inventory levels of retail business customers. Duracell’s revenues in first quarter of 2023 declined 4.5% versus 2022, primarily due to lower volume and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar. Pre-tax earnings of our consumer products group declined $189 million (40.7%) in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2022, primarily attributable to lower earnings from Forest River and the apparel and footwear businesses. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 2.9 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Apparel and footwear earnings declined 18% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Our apparel businesses continue to be negatively affected by lower sales volumes, reduced manufacturing efficiencies and higher manufacturing costs. We expect that comparative operating earnings of these businesses will be lower in the near term. Earnings from Forest River declined 57%, primarily due to the decrease in unit sales, which reduced manufacturing efficiencies, and from unfavorable changes in product mix. We currently expect demand for recreational vehicles will remain relatively low and Forest River’s earnings in the near term to decline versus 2022. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2023 2022 Revenues Service $ 5,319 $ 4,523 Retailing 4,612 4,592 McLane 13,059 12,515 $ 22,990 $ 21,630 Pre-tax earnings Service $ 837 $ 724 Retailing 384 411 McLane 113 82 $ 1,334 $ 1,217 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Service 15.7 % 16.0 % Retailing 8.3 % 9.0 % McLane 0.9 % 0.7 % 41 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training services and products to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Beginning October 19, 2022, this group includes IPS Integrated Project Services, LLC (IPS), a provider of various services in facilities construction management. Service group revenues increased $796 million (17.6%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues from aviation services, the impact of the IPS acquisition ($302 million), and increased revenues from TTI. Revenues of TTI increased 5.8% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. TTI sales levels during 2022 were relatively strong. However, beginning in the third quarter of 2022, new orders slowed in certain regions and markets, in part attributable to elevated inventory levels within the supply chain. These conditions are expected to continue in 2023 and we may experience comparative revenue declines in future periods. Revenues from aviation services increased 18.8% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The revenue increase was primarily due to increases in the number of aircraft in shared aircraft ownership programs and in flight hours across NetJets’ various programs, as well as higher average rates. Pre-tax earnings of the service group increased $113 million (15.6%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 0.3 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings increase was primarily attributable to higher overall margin rates in aviation services businesses, primarily due to changes in business mix, and to the impact of the IPS acquisition. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), representing 67% of our combined retailing revenue in the first quarter of 2023. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also offers vehicle service contracts and operates two insurance businesses. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 18% of the combined retailing revenues in the first quarter of 2023. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. Retailing group revenues were relatively unchanged in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting an increase at BHA, offset by lower revenues from our other retailers. BHA’s revenues in the first quarter of 2023 increased 3.6% compared to 2022. Revenues from new vehicle sales increased 6.9% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022 while revenues from pre-owned vehicle sales declined 4.0%. Unit sales in the first quarter of 2023 increased 0.9%, primarily from new vehicles. While new vehicle levels remain well below historical levels, supplies continue to gradually increase. Revenues from BHA’s service/repair operations in the first quarter of 2023 increased 11.1% versus 2022. Other retailing revenues declined 5.5% in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2022, primarily due to lower sales volumes at our home furnishings businesses. Retailing group pre-tax earnings decreased $27 million (6.6%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 30.9% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. BHA’s earnings increase reflected higher earnings from service/repair and finance/service contract operations and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower vehicle sales margins and higher floor plan interest expense. BHA’s comparative vehicle gross profit margin rates, before the effects of LIFO, peaked in the first half of 2022 and have since declined. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group decreased $91 million (45.1%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a 49.6% decrease in earnings from the home furnishings businesses, and the impact of a gain in 2022 related to the divestiture of certain jewelry stores. 42 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins and operate in a highly competitive environment. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised 61% of McLane’s consolidated sales in the first quarter of 2023, with foodservice representing most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues increased $544 million (4.3%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting an increase of 3.5% from the grocery business and 5.7% from the foodservice business. Pre-tax earnings increased $31 million (37.8%) in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in earnings reflected a slight increase in the gross sales margin rate, partly offset by higher personnel expenses. Non-Controlled Businesses After-tax earnings of our non-controlled businesses include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Occidental Petroleum, Pilot and Berkadia. Earnings attributable to these businesses increased $286 million in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2022, primarily due to earnings from the inclusion of Occidental Petroleum in 2023. As of January 31, 2023, Berkshire acquired a controlling interest in Pilot. We applied the equity method through the end of January 2023 on our pre-existing 38.6% interest and began consolidating Pilot’s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements on February 1, 2023. See Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investment and Derivative Contract Gains (Losses) A summary of investment and derivative contract gains (losses) follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2023 2022 Investment gains (losses) $ 34,758 $ (1,735 ) Derivative contract gains (losses) — (243 ) Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 34,758 (1,978 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 7,319 (398 ) Net earnings (loss) $ 27,439 $ (1,580 ) Effective income tax rate 20.9 % 16.0 % Investment gains (losses) Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Unrealized gains and losses also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in non-U.S. issuers that are held by our U.S.-based subsidiaries. Pre-tax investment gains and losses in the first quarter included net unrealized gains of $31.3 billion in 2023 compared to net unrealized losses of $1.8 billion in 2022 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Taxable investment gains and losses on equity securities sold is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost of the securities sold. Sales of equity securities in the first quarter produced taxable gains of $2.2 billion in 2023 compared to taxable losses of $739 million in 2022. Pre-tax investment gains in the first quarter of 2023 included a non-cash gain of $3 billion related to the remeasurement of our pre-existing interest in Pilot to fair value through the application of acquisition accounting upon attaining control of Pilot for financial reporting purposes. We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains and losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative contract gains (losses) Derivative contract gains and losses include the changes in fair value of our few remaining equity index put option contract liabilities. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings. Substantially all of our contracts have expired and our exposure to loss in the future is insignificant. 43 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). First Quarter 2023 2022 Acquisition accounting expenses $ (202 ) $ (161 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (64 ) (70 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes (17 ) 522 Other earnings 172 79 $ (111 ) $ 370 After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s and BHFC’s Euro, Great Britain Pound and Japanese Yen denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. In 2022, we recorded significant foreign currency exchange rate gains on these debt issues, due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, which reduced the U.S Dollar carrying value of the debt. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other earnings consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes. Financial Condition Our Consolidated Balance Sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Our Consolidated shareholders’ equity at March 31, 2023 was $504.6 billion, an increase of $31.1 billion since December 31, 2022. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $35.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023, which included after-tax gains on our investments of $27.4 billion. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities will produce significant volatility in our earnings. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $4.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. At March 31, 2023, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $127.7 billion, which included $106.9 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stock) were $350.7 billion. During the first quarter of 2023, we paid cash of $2.9 billion to acquire equity securities and we received proceeds of $13.3 billion from sales of equity securities. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot for approximately $8.2 billion. Our consolidated borrowings at March 31, 2023 were $123.6 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF, BHE and its subsidiaries and Pilot. In the first quarter of 2023, we paid approximately $6.2 billion on maturing term debt and increased short-term borrowings by approximately $1.1 billion. 44 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition (Continued) Berkshire parent company outstanding debt at March 31, 2023 was $17.5 billion, a decrease of $3.9 billion since December 31, 2022 due to repayments of maturing debt during the first quarter. In April 2023, Berkshire issued ¥164.4 billion (approximately $1.2 billion) of senior notes and repaid ¥56.3 billion of maturing notes. Senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, were approximately $17.9 billion at March 31, 2023, substantially unchanged from December 31, 2022. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $22.7 billion as of March 31, 2023, a decrease of $705 million from December 31, 2022. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $53.0 billion at March 31, 2023, an increase of $215 million from December 31, 2022. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $3.9 billion. Borrowings of Pilot were $6.5 billion as of March 31,2023, of which $5.9 billion was outstanding as of the January 31, 2023 acquisition date. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt or other borrowings issued by BNSF, BHE, Pilot or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates. In the first quarter of 2023, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of $8.7 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF, BHE and Pilot) of $2.6 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Forecasted capital expenditures for BHE and BNSF over the remainder of 2023 approximate $11.7 billion. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“the 2022 act”) was signed into law. The 2022 act contains numerous provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax on “adjusted financial statement income”, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The provisions of the 2022 act become effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. On December 27, 2022, the IRS and Department of Treasury issued initial guidance for taxpayers subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. The guidance addresses several, but not all, issues that needed clarification. The IRS and Department of Treasury intend to release additional guidance in the future. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the 2022 act as more guidance becomes available. We currently do not expect a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were $143 billion at March 31, 2023. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of March 31, 2023, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF, aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets and certain raw materials purchase commitments. 45 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations (Continued) Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2023 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2023 includes estimated liabilities of $143 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2023 included goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $83 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $21 billion, which included $9.5 billion of goodwill associated with the Alleghany and Pilot acquisitions. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2022. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2022, the estimated fair values of six reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). Our estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $31.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $30.3 billion by 4.0%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the five other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $4.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $4.1 billion by 9.9%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.4 billion. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. As of March 31, 2023, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts and general changes in business conditions on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently anticipate, and we may need to record goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units are inherently subjective and will likely continue to be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of adverse events on a reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates can be subject to wide variations. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 46 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of March 31, 2023, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Ris k Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. 47 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use o f Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the first quarter of 2023 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program January Class A common stock 468 $ 475,158.19 468 * Class B common stock 1,323,333 $ 310.87 1,323,333 * February Class A common stock 249 $ 464,461.13 249 * Class B common stock 892,938 $ 304.58 892,938 * March Class A common stock 4,386 $ 465,791.01 4,386 * Class B common stock 4,500,593 $ 305.57 4,500,593 * * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $30 billion. Item 3. Defaults Upo n Senior Securities None Item 4. Mine Safe ty Disclosures Information regarding the Company’s mine safety violations and other legal matters disclosed in accordance with Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-Q. Item 5. Other Information As disclosed in Notes 2 and 16 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q, we adopted ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023 on the modified retrospective basis beginning as of the January 1, 2021 transition date. Most significantly, ASU 2018-12 changed the measurement of our long duration life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, primarily attributable to changes in discount rate assumptions used in measuring such liabilities. ASU 2018-12 also made relatively minor modifications to the accounting for deferred policy acquisition cost amortization and changed the classification and measurement of certain market risk benefit liabilities, such as those related to variable annuity contracts. 48 Item 5.

General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, the magnitude of gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. To varying degrees, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus and its variants. Such actions in 2022 included temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world. In addition, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs emerged in 2021 and have persisted in 2022. The development of geopolitical conflicts in 2022 have contributed to disruptions of supply chains, resulting in cost increases for commodities, goods and services in many parts of the world. In the U.S. and elsewhere, governments are implementing actions intended to slow price inflation. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2. New accounting pronouncements In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2018-12”). ASU 2018-12 requires reassessment of cash flow assumptions at least annually and revision of discount rate assumptions each reporting period in valuing policyholder liabilities of long-duration contracts. Under ASU 2018-12, the effects from changes in cash flow assumptions are reflected in earnings and the effects from changes in discount rate assumptions are reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the cash flow and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 is to be applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented in the financial statements, will require new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt ASU 2018-12 as of January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method, whereby revised cash flow and discount rate assumptions as of January 1, 2021 (the transition date) are applied to contracts then in-force, with liabilities then remeasured, with the cumulative effect from discount rate changes (based on changes in prevailing interest rates) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and the cumulative effect from cash flow assumption changes in retained earnings. While we have not finalized our assessment and continue to evaluate the impact of the adoption beginning as of the transition date, we believe that the changes in discount rate assumptions will initially have a greater effect on our recorded liabilities than changes in cash flow assumptions. We preliminarily estimate the cumulative effect of adopting ASU 2018-12 will reduce our consolidated shareholders’ equity from the amount previously reported by approximately $ 6.5 billion as of January 1, 2021, with that reduction declining to approximately $ 4.7 billion as of December 31, 2021. While we have not determined the effect of adopting ASU 2018-12 as of September 30, 2022, we currently expect the cumulative reduction to our consolidated shareholders’ equity has declined significantly since December 31, 2021, based on the interest rate increases in 2022. 8 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.

Investments in equity securities (Continued) As of September 30, 2022, we owned 151.6 million shares of American Express Company (“American Express”) common stock representing 20.3 % of the American Express outstanding common stock. Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors and we have agreed to passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we have not applied the equity method of accounting to our investment in American Express and continue to record our investment at fair value. During the first six months of 2022, we acquired approximately 17 % of the outstanding common stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) and in the third quarter of 2022, we acquired additional shares such that our aggregate voting interest exceeded 20 % on August 4, 2022. We adopted the equity method with respect to our investment in Occidental common stock as of that date and included this investment in equity method investments at September 30, 2022. See Note 5. We continue to report our investments in Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock and Occidental common stock warrants at fair value as equity securities, as such interests are not in-substance common stock under GAAP and are not eligible for the equity method. Our investment in Occidental preferred stock has an aggregate liquidation value of $ 10 billion and our investment in Occidental warrants allows us to purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $ 59.62 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8 % per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends and is mandatorily redeemable under specified events. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these are our investments in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”) and, as of August 4, 2022, Occidental. We own 26.5 % of Kraft Heinz common stock and we own 20.9 % of Occidental common stock, which excludes the potential effect of the exercise of Occidental common stock warrants. See Note 4. Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Occidental is an international energy company, including oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and chemicals manufacturing businesses. Occidental’s midstream businesses purchase, market, gather, process, transport and store various oil, natural gas, carbon dioxide and other products. We anticipate Occidental’s financial information will not be available in time for concurrent reporting in our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we will report the equity method effects for Occidental on a one-quarter lag. Our earnings in the fourth quarter of 2022 will include our equity method share of Occidental's third quarter earnings. The common stock of Kraft Heinz and Occidental are publicly traded. The fair values and carrying values of these two investments in addition to the carrying values of our other significant equity method investments are summarized as follows (in millions).

Investment and derivative contract gains/losses Investment and derivative contract gains/losses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 and 2021 are summarized as follows (in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2022 2021 2022 2021 Investment gains (losses): Equity securities: Change in unrealized investment gains (losses) during the period on securities held at the end of the period $ ( 12,902 ) $ 4,759 $ ( 80,496 ) $ 36,163 Investment gains (losses) on securities sold during the period ( 165 ) 75 ( 1,085 ) 889 ( 13,067 ) 4,834 ( 81,581 ) 37,052 Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains 6 24 18 59 Gross realized losses ( 433 ) ( 7 ) ( 509 ) ( 20 ) Other ( 6 ) — ( 17 ) 144 Investment gains (losses) ( 13,500 ) 4,851 ( 82,089 ) 37,235 Derivative contract gains (losses) 35 70 ( 273 ) 780 $ ( 13,465 ) $ 4,921 $ ( 82,362 ) $ 38,015 Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the period. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $ 17.3 billion in the first nine months of 2022 and $ 12.0 billion in the first nine months of 2021. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the period represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable period or, if later, the purchase date. Taxable gains/losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Equity securities sold produced taxable gains of $ 3 million in the third quarter and taxable losses of $ 660 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to taxable gains of $ 941 million in the third quarter and $ 2.9 billion in the first nine months of 2021. Our derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts. As of September 30, 2022, we had four open contracts, which had an aggregate fair value liability of less than $ 1 million and an aggregate notional value of $ 1.6 billion. 12 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7.

Note 13. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 14), for each of the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2022 and 2021 follows (in millions). 2022 2021 Balances at beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 86,664 $ 79,854 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 2,960 ) ( 2,912 ) Net liabilities 83,704 76,942 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year 44,472 38,447 Prior accident years ( 2,141 ) ( 2,151 ) Total 42,331 36,296 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year ( 17,543 ) ( 15,277 ) Prior accident years ( 18,564 ) ( 15,076 ) Total ( 36,107 ) ( 30,353 ) Foreign currency effect ( 1,044 ) ( 119 ) Balances at September 30: Net liabilities 88,884 82,766 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 2,758 2,988 Gross liabilities $ 91,642 $ 85,754 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. Current accident year incurred losses in the first nine months of 2022 and 2021 included approximately $ 4.0 billion and $ 2.7 billion, respectively, from significant catastrophe events (losses in excess of $ 100 million per event). Significant catastrophe events in the first nine months included Hurricane Ian ($ 3.4 billion) and floods in Australia and South Africa in 2022 and Winter Storm Uri, Hurricane Ida ($ 1.5 billion) and floods in Europe in 2021. In the first nine months, we recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 2.1 billion in 2022 and $ 2.2 billion in 2021, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 2.6 % in 2022 and 2.8 % in 2021. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years from primary insurance in the first nine months were reduced by $ 734 million in 2022 and $ 1.6 billion in 2021. The reductions in each period derived primarily from private passenger automobile, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years attributable to property and casualty reinsurance in the first nine months decreased $ 1.4 billion in 2022 and $ 564 million in 2021. 16 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charges for each of the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions). 2022 2021 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges - retroactive reinsurance Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges - retroactive reinsurance Balances at beginning of year $ 38,256 $ ( 10,639 ) $ 40,966 $ ( 12,441 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current year contracts — — 82 — Prior years’ contracts ( 23 ) 649 ( 9 ) 709 Total ( 23 ) 649 73 709 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 1,567 ) — ( 1,318 ) — Balances at September 30 $ 36,666 $ ( 9,990 ) $ 39,721 $ ( 11,732 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 626 $ 782 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposure to losses began. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first nine months for prior years’ contracts were $ 626 million in 2022 and $ 700 million in 2021 and included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments. Currently, our largest retroactive reinsurance contract is between our subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, and certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”). Our estimated claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $ 14.8 billion at September 30, 2022 and $ 15.8 billion at December 31, 2021. Deferred charges related to the AIG contract were $ 4.14 billion at September 30, 2022 and $ 4.45 billion at December 31, 2021. Note 15. Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of September 30, 2022.

Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $ 600 million of maturing senior notes and issued ¥ 128.5 billion (approximately $ 1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5 %. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In March 2022, BHFC issued $ 4.5 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4 % and € 1.25 billion (approximately $ 1.4 billion) of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8 %. In May 2022, BHFC repaid $ 775 million of maturing senior notes. The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 8.15 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 914 billion par at September 30, 2022) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $ 1.2 billion in the third quarter and $ 3.3 billion in the first nine months of 2022 as compared to $ 264 million in the third quarter and $ 939 million in the first nine months of 2021. Berkshire also guarantees debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $ 3.7 billion at September 30, 2022. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. Weighted Average Interest Rate September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2023 - 2053 4.3 % $ 13,992 $ 13,003 Subsidiary and other debt due 2022 - 2064 4.2 % 36,226 36,759 Short-term borrowings 4.2 % 1,441 2,009 Burlington Northern Santa Fe (""BNSF"") and subsidiaries due 2022 - 2097 4.5 % 23,302 23,219 $ 74,961 $ 74,990 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In April 2022, BHE issued $ 1.0 billion of 4.6 % senior notes due in 2053 . During the first nine months of 2022, BHE subsidiaries issued approximately $ 1.3 billion of variable and fixed rate term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.9 % as of September 30 and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2052 . BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In June 2022, BNSF issued $ 1.0 billion of 4.45 % debentures due in 2053 . During the first nine months of 2022, BNSF repaid $ 900 million of term debt. As of September 30, 2022, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries have unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $ 10.7 billion at September 30, 2022, which included approximately $ 9.2 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 18 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16. Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, other receivables and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of their fair values.

Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions).

These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. 20 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 17. Common stock Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the first nine months of 2022 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Class A, $ 5 Par Value ( 1,650,000 shares authorized) Class B, $ 0.0033 Par Value ( 3,225,000,000 shares authorized) Issued Treasury Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding Balances at December 31, 2021 665,901 ( 48,788 ) 617,113 1,488,292,852 ( 197,818,349 ) 1,290,474,503 Conversions of Class A to Class B common stock ( 12,093 ) — ( 12,093 ) 18,139,500 — 18,139,500 Treasury stock acquired — ( 6,818 ) ( 6,818 ) — ( 6,850,133 ) ( 6,850,133 ) Balances at September 30, 2022 653,808 ( 55,606 ) 598,202 1,506,432,352 ( 204,668,482 ) 1,301,763,870 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,466,045 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and 1,477,429 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth ( 1/1,500 ) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth ( 1/1,500 ) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times the average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $ 30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note 18. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were 37.1 % in the third quarter and 23.5 % in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 14.7 % in the third quarter and 18.8 % in the first nine months of 2021. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in certain equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, including investment gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. 21 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. On March 20, 2022 , Berkshire entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger with Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”) to acquire all of Alleghany’s outstanding common stock for cash consideration of approximately $ 11.6 billion. Following the receipt of Alleghany shareholder approval on June 9, 2022 and all required regulatory approvals, the acquisition was completed on October 19, 2022 . The consideration paid was funded by existing cash balances. Alleghany operates a group of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses. It also owns a portfolio of non-financial businesses. Given the proximity of the Alleghany acquisition date to the date these interim Consolidated Financial Statements were issued, it was impracticable to provide an initial estimate of the fair values of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and residual goodwill or proforma information. We expect to provide disclosures of preliminary values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date as well as proforma information, if material, in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ending December 31, 2022. Alleghany’s most recently available historical consolidated financial statements are as of September 30, 2022. As of that date, Alleghany’s total assets and liabilities were $ 31.2 billion and $ 23.4 billion, respectively. In June 2022, BHE acquired the BHE common stock held by Greg Abel, Berkshire’s Vice Chairman - non-insurance operations, for $ 870 million. The purchase was pursuant to the terms of a shareholders agreement between Berkshire, BHE and BHE’s non-controlling shareholders. Berkshire recorded a charge of $ 362 million to capital in excess of par value for the excess of the consideration paid over the carrying value of the acquired noncontrolling interest. 22 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 22. Revenues from contracts with customers We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 and 2021 (in millions). Other revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP, are primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines and marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management.

We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. In varying degrees, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our operating businesses. In addition, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs emerged in 2021 and have persisted in 2022. Further, geopolitical conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have developed in 2022. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of these events on our businesses or when our operations will normalize. Nor can we reliably predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Insurance underwriting after-tax earnings decreased $178 million in the third quarter and $690 million in the first nine months of 2022 versus 2021. After-tax incurred losses attributable to significant catastrophe occurrences in the third quarter were approximately $2.7 billion from Hurricane Ian in 2022 and $1.7 billion from Hurricane Ida and floods in Europe in 2021. Underwriting results in 2022 were also negatively impacted by increases in private passenger automobile claims frequencies and severities, and favorably impacted by higher foreign currency exchange rate gains arising from the remeasurement of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries and improved life and health reinsurance results. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased $247 million in the third quarter and $896 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to increased dividend income and higher interest rates. After-tax earnings of our railroad, BNSF, declined 6.2% in the third quarter and increased 4.0% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The comparative changes in earnings in 2022 reflected higher revenue per car/unit, lower overall freight volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 5.9% in the third quarter and 5.5% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases reflected higher earnings from tax equity investments and from the natural gas pipeline and Northern Powergrid businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from the U.S. regulated utilities and real estate brokerage businesses. After-tax earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 20.0% in the third quarter and 14.3% in the first nine months of 2022 versus 2021. Results were mixed among our various businesses. While customer demand for products and services was relatively good in 2022, demand began to weaken in the third quarter at certain of our businesses. We continue to experience the negative effects of higher materials, freight, labor and other input costs. Investment and derivative contract gains and losses in 2022 and 2021 predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and includes unrealized gains and losses from market price changes during the period. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or in evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Other earnings included after-tax foreign currency exchange gains related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt of $858 million in the third quarter and $2.4 billion in the first nine months of 2022, compared to $196 million and $676 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively. 26 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett, and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the quarterly or annual operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding $100 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in 2022 included Hurricane Ian in the third quarter and floods in Australia and South Africa during the first six months, while significant events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida and floods in Europe in the third quarter and Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter. We recorded estimated pre-tax losses of $3.4 billion from Hurricane Ian in the third quarter of 2022 and $2.2 billion from Hurricane Ida and European floods in the third quarter of 2021. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $128 billion as of September 30, 2022. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries from foreign currency exchange rate changes. Underwriting results of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses have been affected by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. While pandemic-related losses in the first nine months of 2022 were insignificant, results in future periods may be affected by legal and regulatory actions pertaining to insurance coverage, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. On October 19, 2022, Berkshire acquired Alleghany Corporation (""Alleghany""), which operates property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses. These businesses will be incorporated into our reinsurance and primary insurance results beginning as of the acquisition date. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting losses in 2022 reflected increased claims severities, primarily due to significant cost inflation in property and physical damage claims, which began to accelerate in the second half of 2021 and have continued through 2022. Increases in used car prices are producing increased claims severities on total losses and shortages of car parts are contributing to elevated claims severities on partial losses. In addition, injury claims severities continue to trend higher. Premiums written were relatively unchanged in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases in average premiums per auto policy due to rate increases, which were substantially offset by a decrease in policies-in-force. Voluntary auto policies-in-force declined 4.6% over the first nine months of 2022 while average premiums per voluntary auto policy increased by approximately 5.4%. Premiums earned increased $204 million (2.1%) in the third quarter and $1.1 billion (3.9%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Premiums earned in the first nine months of 2021 included a reduction of approximately $475 million attributable to the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback program that provided a 15% premium credit to new and renewing voluntary auto and motorcycle policies written between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $1.0 billion (12.1%) in the third quarter and $4.6 billion (20.4%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned was 97.0% in the third quarter and 93.1% in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 8.6 percentage points and 12.7 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases were primarily attributable to higher claims frequencies and severities, as well as lower reductions of loss estimates for prior years’ loss events and an increase in significant catastrophe losses. Claims frequencies in the first nine months of 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (one to two percent range), bodily injury and personal injury (four to five percent range) and collision (six to seven percent range). Average claims severities in the first nine months of 2022 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (seventeen to nineteen percent range) and bodily injury coverage (nine to eleven percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ loss events of $386 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to $1.2 billion in 2021. The reductions in 2022 reflected decreases in all major coverages except collision and property damage coverages, while the reductions in 2021 were across all major coverages. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the third quarter were approximately $600 million from Hurricane Ian in 2022 and $400 million from Hurricane Ida in 2021. Underwriting expenses decreased $355 million (25.2%) in the third quarter and $718 million (17.3%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to significant reductions in advertising costs in both periods and lower employee-related costs in the first nine months. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 10.7% in the third quarter and 11.8% in the first nine months of 2022, decreases of 3.9 percentage points and 3.0 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, attributable to both the decreases in expenses as well as the increases in earned premiums. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary’s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”). A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

The increases were across a variety of property and casualty coverages and across several markets. 28 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) BH Primary’s loss ratio was 81.1% in the third quarter and 74.0% in the first nine months of 2022, an increase of 5.5 percentage points in the third quarter and 1.8 percentage points in the first nine months compared to 2021. Losses from catastrophe events in 2022 were approximately $660 million in the third quarter (Hurricane Ian) and $740 million in the first nine months. Losses from catastrophe events in 2021 were approximately $260 million in the third quarter (largely Hurricane Ida) and $420 million in the first nine months. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events in the first nine months of $348 million in 2022 and $420 million in 2021. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of workers’ compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Claims liabilities could be greater than anticipated due to a variety of factors. Underwriting expenses increased $194 million (26.0%) in the third quarter and $541 million (27.3%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The expense ratio increased 1.8 percentage points in the third quarter and 1.9 percentage points in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. These increases reflected costs associated with new business development programs and changes in business mix. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity business due to the expected long durations of the claim liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such business, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) Premiums written increased $459 million (11.2%) in the third quarter and $1.2 billion (10.0%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to net increases in new property business and higher rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $465 million (15.6%) in the third quarter and $136 million (1.8%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Losses incurred from catastrophe events were $1.9 billion in the third quarter (primarily Hurricane Ian) and $2.6 billion in the first nine months of 2022 and were $1.5 billion in the third quarter and $1.9 billion in the first nine months of 2021. Reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years were $833 million in the third quarter and $1.4 billion in the first nine months of 2022 and were $599 million in the third quarter and $564 million in the first nine months of 2021. Underwriting expenses as percentages of premiums earned decreased 11.3 percentage points in the third quarter and 9.1 percentage points in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange rate effects and changes in business mix. Underwriting expenses included foreign currency exchange gains of $315 million in the third quarter and $704 million in the first nine months of 2022, primarily related to a third quarter 2021 intercompany reinsurance agreement in which a non-U.S. based Berkshire subsidiary ceded non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities to a U.S. based Berkshire subsidiary. The foreign currency exchange gains in the third quarter of 2021 were not significant. Under U.S. GAAP, the effects of exchange rate changes from the remeasurement of liabilities assumed by the U.S. subsidiary are reflected in earnings as its functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. The net foreign currency exchange rate effects from translating the financial statements of the non-U.S. subsidiary to the U.S. Dollar are included in other comprehensive income. Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Life and health benefits declined $234 million (18.8%) in the third quarter and $705 million (18.9%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to relatively high pandemic-related mortality claims in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America in 2021. Retroactive reinsurance Pre-tax underwriting losses in each period derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign currency exchange gains were $130 million in the third quarter and $287 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to $70 million in the first nine months of 2021, substantially all of which was in the third quarter. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $213 million in the third quarter and $612 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to $227 million in the third quarter and $690 million in the first nine months of 2021. Unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2022 to $36.7 billion at September 30, 2022, primarily due to loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $649 million in the first nine months of 2022 to $10.0 billion at September 30, 2022, primarily attributable to periodic amortization. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. 30 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned were relatively unchanged in the third quarter and increased 15.5% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. Our periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses, deriving from the recurring accretion of time-value discounted annuity liabilities, which includes discount accrual on liabilities of contracts without life contingencies. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency gains of $119 million in the third quarter and $279 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to $45 million in the third quarter and $25 million in the first nine months of 2021. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $268 million in the third quarter and $558 million in the first nine months of 2022 and $139 million in the third quarter and $399 million in the first nine months of 2021. Pre-tax losses in the third quarter of 2022 included approximately $130 million attributable to an agreement to terminate an existing reinsurance contract, in which the settlement payable exceeded the carrying value of the liabilities. Discounted annuity liabilities were $15.2 billion at September 30, 2022, which included $3.9 billion for contracts without life contingencies, and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%. Upon the adoption of ASU 2018-12 in 2023, the discount rates will be adjusted quarterly based upon prevailing interest rates which could have a significant effect on our recorded annuity liabilities. The periodic effect from discount rate changes will be largely reflected in other comprehensive income. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax gains of $32 million in the third quarter and $83 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to pre-tax losses of $28 million in the third quarter and gains of $97 million in the first nine months of 2021. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting earnings in the first nine months of 2022 and 2021 were primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate increases and changes in securities markets which were unfavorable in 2022 and favorable in 2021. Underwriting results in the third quarter of 2021 included losses from lower underlying lapse rate assumptions. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months Percentage Change 2022 2021 2022 2021 Third Quarter First Nine Months Dividend income $ 1,281 $ 1,196 $ 4,533 $ 3,747 7.1 % 21.0 % Interest and other investment income 397 141 789 458 181.6 72.3 Pre-tax net investment income 1,678 1,337 5,322 4,205 25.5 26.6 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 270 176 838 617 Net investment income $ 1,408 $ 1,161 $ 4,484 $ 3,588 Effective income tax rate 16.1 % 13.1 % 15.7 % 14.7 % Dividend income increased 7.1% in the third quarter and 21.0% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases in 2022 reflected an overall increase in equity security investments during 2022. Dividend income also varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Dividend income included $8 million in the third quarter and $37 million in the first nine months of 2022 and $26 million in the third quarter and $101 million in the first nine months of 2021 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Interest and other investment income increased $256 million (181.6%) in the third quarter and $331 million (72.3%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases were primarily due to increases in short-term interest rates. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. While exceptionally low interest rates prevailed in recent years, interest rates increased significantly over the first nine months of 2022. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. 31 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $150 billion at September 30, 2022 and $147 billion at December 31, 2021. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting losses of $358 million in the first nine months of 2022 and, consequently, the average cost of float for that period was 0.24%. In October 2022, Berkshire acquired Alleghany, which operates insurance and reinsurance businesses. Estimated float of Alleghany’s businesses approximated $13.5 billion based on its historical balance sheet at September 30, 2022.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad (Continued) The following table summarizes BNSF’s railroad freight volumes by business group (cars/units in thousands). Cars/Units Percentage Change Third Quarter First Nine Months Third First Nine 2022 2021 2022 2021 Quarter Months Consumer products 1,323 1,425 3,977 4,307 (7.2 )% (7.7 )% Industrial products 413 443 1,237 1,280 (6.8 ) (3.4 ) Agricultural products 276 265 884 896 4.2 (1.3 ) Coal 399 404 1,158 1,127 (1.2 ) 2.8 2,411 2,537 7,256 7,610 (5.0 ) (4.7 ) Railroad operating revenues increased 16.8% in the third quarter and 14.3% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to increases in average revenue per car/unit resulting from higher fuel surcharge revenue driven by higher fuel prices, along with increased rates per car/unit, partially offset by lower volumes. BNSF’s pre-tax earnings decreased 7.1% in the third quarter and increased 3.1% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Results for the third quarter were impacted by lower freight volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs, partially offset by higher revenue per car. Operating revenues from consumer products were $2.4 billion in the third quarter and $7.0 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 15.3% and 14.5%, respectively, from 2021. The increases reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume decreases of 7.2% in the third quarter and 7.7% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The volume decreases were primarily due to lower international intermodal shipments resulting from supply chain disruptions. Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.5 billion in the third quarter and $4.2 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 7.1% and 6.9%, respectively, from 2021. The increases reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume decreases of 6.8% in the third quarter and 3.4% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The volume decreases in both the third quarter and first nine months were primarily due to lower petroleum and building products shipments. Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.3 billion in the third quarter and $4.1 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 25.7% and 12.0%, respectively, compared to 2021. The increases were primarily attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes increased 4.2% in the third quarter due to higher domestic grain shipments and increased renewable diesel and oil feedstock shipments, while volumes decreased 1.3% in the first nine months of 2022, primarily due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of domestic grains, renewable diesel and oil feedstocks. Operating revenues from coal were $1.1 billion in the third quarter and $3.0 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 27.0% and 28.8%, respectively, from 2021. The increases were primarily attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes decreased 1.2% in the third quarter primarily due to network challenges, while volumes increased 2.8% in the first nine months of 2022 due to increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand. Railroad operating expenses were $4.4 billion in the third quarter and $12.2 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of $1.1 billion (32.8%) and $2.2 billion (21.8%), respectively, compared to 2021. The increases were primarily due to significant increases in the cost of fuel, as well as higher compensation and benefits expenses. Our ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 8.2 percentage points to 67.7% in the third quarter and 4.0 percentage points to 65.2% in the first nine months of 2022 versus the comparable 2021 periods. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $311 million (26.6%) in the third quarter and $439 million (12.6%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to wage inflation, including the impact from tentative or ratified union labor agreements, higher health and welfare costs and lower productivity. Fuel expenses increased $567 million (80.4%) in the third quarter and $1.5 billion (75.0%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher fuel prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $170 million (50.3%) in the third quarter and $232 million (18.4%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to general inflation, lower gains from land and easement sales and higher casualty costs. Approximately 30,500 of BNSF’s employees are members of a labor union. The U.S. Class I railroads and rail labor unions were engaged in negotiations from January 2020 through June 2022. Federal mediation was included in that timeframe, followed by a release from the National Mediation Board for a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB). In accordance with the Railway Labor Act (RLA), the PEB issued its report and recommendations to settle the bargaining disputes on August 16, 2022. Tentative agreements based on these recommendations were reached with all labor unions in September 2022. To date, six unions have ratified those agreements. Two labor unions did not ratify their tentative agreement, and the parties have agreed to maintain the status quo as discussions continue. Ratification results for the remaining unions are scheduled to be announced through November 2022. Where settlements have not been successful following the RLA process, Congress may act by extending the status quo period or passing a law imposing a resolution on the parties. 33 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy We currently own 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. BHE subsidiaries also operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid in Great Britain. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“LNG interest”), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments. BHE also operates a residential real estate brokerage business and a large network of residential real estate brokerage franchises in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are largely based on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 6,095 $ 5,225 $ 15,858 $ 14,375 Real estate operating revenue 1,405 1,743 4,284 4,738 Other income (loss) 31 45 (110 ) (91 ) Total revenue 7,531 7,013 20,032 19,022 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 1,959 1,385 4,944 4,064 Energy operating expense 2,362 2,132 6,858 6,302 Real estate operating costs and expense 1,352 1,608 4,086 4,312 Interest expense 537 513 1,583 1,547 Total costs and expense 6,210 5,638 17,471 16,225 Pre-tax earnings 1,321 1,375 2,561 2,797 Income tax expense (benefit)* (570 ) (398 ) (1,274 ) (842 ) Net earnings after income taxes 1,891 1,773 3,835 3,639 Noncontrolling interests of BHE subsidiaries 147 103 376 311 Net earnings attributable to BHE 1,744 1,670 3,459 3,328 Noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends 159 174 358 389 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 1,585 $ 1,496 $ 3,101 $ 2,939 Effective income tax rate (43.1 )% (28.9 )% (49.7 )% (30.1 )% * Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation. The discussion of BHE’s operating results that follows is based on after-tax earnings, reflecting how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated. A summary of net earnings attributable to BHE follows (dollars in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (Continued) PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. After-tax earnings increased $76 million in the third quarter and decreased $106 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The changes reflected increases in utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and higher production tax credits recognized in the third quarter and higher operating expenses. The increases in operating expenses reflected higher accruals in the first nine months of 2022 associated with wildfires in 2020, higher general and plant maintenance costs and incremental costs from additional assets placed in-service. PacifiCorp’s utility margin was $1.1 billion in the third quarter and $2.7 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of $68 million and $88 million, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2021. The increases reflected higher operating revenue from favorable retail and wholesale pricing and increases in retail customer volumes, partially offset by higher purchased power and thermal generation costs. Retail customer volumes increased 3.5% in the third quarter and 0.8% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather, partially offset by lower customer usage. MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings decreased $73 million in the third quarter and increased $17 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The changes reflected increases in electric utility margin offset by higher operating expenses and lower other income. Additionally, comparative income tax benefits were lower in the third quarter and higher in the first nine months of 2022, as higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered and solar-powered generating facilities placed in-service ($14 million in the third quarter and $106 million in the first nine months) were offset by the impacts of ratemaking. The increase in operating expenses included higher costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms. MEC’s electric utility margin was $774 million in the third quarter and $1.8 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 12% and 15%, respectively, versus 2021. The increases were attributable to higher operating revenue from increased retail and wholesale customer volumes and favorable wholesale pricing, partially offset by higher purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes increased 3.1% in the third quarter and 4.0% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher customer usage. NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings decreased $12 million in the third quarter and $24 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The decreases reflected higher operating expenses from increased plant operations and maintenance expenses, higher accruals for earnings sharing and incremental costs from additional assets placed in-service, partially offset by higher interest income from carrying charges on regulatory balances. NV Energy’s electric utility margin was $622 million in the third quarter and $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2022, relatively unchanged compared to 2021. Electric retail customer volumes increased 0.3% in the third quarter and 1.3% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather. Northern Powergrid’s after-tax earnings increased $17 million in the third quarter and $120 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in the first nine months of 2021 included deferred income tax expense of $109 million related to the enactment in June 2021 of an increase in the United Kingdom income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. In addition, earnings increased at CE Gas from new projects placed in-service in March and July 2022 and improved distribution business results largely from higher tariff rates, which were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects in 2022. Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings increased $88 million in the third quarter and $102 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases were primarily due to higher earnings at BHE GT&S, largely from the impacts of a general rate case, favorable income tax adjustments and lower operating expenses. The year-to-date increase was partially offset by reduced margins in 2022 due to higher natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue in 2021, attributable to an increase in demand as a result of the February 2021 winter storms. Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings increased $13 million in the third quarter and $205 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases in earnings were primarily due to increased wind tax equity investment earnings of $24 million in the third quarter and $182 million in the first nine months of 2022 as well as from higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects, partly offset by lower earnings from natural gas generating facilities. The increases in wind tax equity investment earnings reflected increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. The comparative increase in year-to-date earnings also reflected the impact of losses in 2021 on pre-existing tax equity investments due to the February 2021 winter storms. 35 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (Continued) Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings decreased $73 million in the third quarter and $187 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The decreases in earnings were primarily attributable to lower earnings from mortgage services due to a decrease in funded volume primarily from a decline in refinancing activity and lower earnings from brokerage and settlement services from a decrease in closed units, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings increased $38 million in the third quarter and was relatively unchanged for the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting higher federal income tax credits recognized, partially offset by higher interest expense and lower earnings from non-regulated energy services in the first nine months. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months Percentage Change 2022 2021 2022 2021 Third Quarter First Nine Months Revenues Manufacturing $ 19,000 $ 17,496 $ 57,193 $ 50,821 8.6 % 12.5 % Service and retailing 23,136 21,291 67,645 62,143 8.7 8.9 $ 42,136 $ 38,787 $ 124,838 $ 112,964 Pre-tax earnings Manufacturing $ 2,883 $ 2,445 $ 8,735 $ 7,595 17.9 % 15.0 % Service and retailing 1,314 1,102 3,806 3,413 19.2 11.5 4,197 3,547 12,541 11,008 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 950 841 3,020 2,679 Net earnings* $ 3,247 $ 2,706 $ 9,521 $ 8,329 Effective income tax rate 22.1 % 22.9 % 23.6 % 23.7 % Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues 10.0 % 9.1 % 10.0 % 9.7 % * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, primarily related to the amortization of identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings were $161 million in the third quarter and $484 million in the first nine months of 2022 and $169 million in the third quarter and $532 million in the first nine months of 2021. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page 26 and in the “Other” earnings section on page 42. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of these operations follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenues Industrial products $ 7,723 $ 7,192 $ 22,912 $ 21,050 Building products 7,589 6,374 22,011 18,404 Consumer products 3,688 3,930 12,270 11,367 $ 19,000 $ 17,496 $ 57,193 $ 50,821 Pre-tax earnings Industrial products $ 1,375 $ 1,124 $ 3,861 $ 3,508 Building products 1,236 833 3,687 2,576 Consumer products 272 488 1,187 1,511 $ 2,883 $ 2,445 $ 8,735 $ 7,595 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Industrial products 17.8 % 15.6 % 16.9 % 16.7 % Building products 16.3 % 13.1 % 16.8 % 14.0 % Consumer products 7.4 % 12.4 % 9.7 % 13.3 % 36 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)) and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Revenues of the industrial products group increased $531 million (7.4%) in the third quarter and $1.9 billion (8.8%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings increased $251 million (22.3%) in the third quarter and $353 million (10.1%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 16.9% for the first nine months of 2022, an increase of 0.2 percentage points compared to 2021. Operating results in 2022 were negatively affected by a combination of higher materials and energy costs, manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages and asset impairment charges, which largely offset the impacts of increased average selling prices and increased demand for certain product categories. Operating results of this group’s international businesses were also negatively impacted in 2022 by the stronger U.S. Dollar. PCC’s revenues were $1.9 billion in the third quarter and $5.5 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 17.5% in the third quarter and 14.5% in the first nine months compared to 2021. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from sales of aerospace products. The revenue increases in 2022 were primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products. While commercial air travel increased in both the U.S. and international markets, traffic remains below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Further recovery likely will be uneven, attributable in part to travel restrictions imposed from time-to-time to control the spread of variants of COVID-19, as well as from the changes in supply chain conditions, including the availability of workers. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of narrow-body aircraft have rebounded since the onset of the pandemic. However, deliveries of wide-body aircraft remain relatively low, in part attributable to the pause in the Boeing 787 program, which resumed deliveries in the third quarter of 2022. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings declined $37 million in the third quarter and $13 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting the impacts of a year-to-date reduction in pension plan income of $43 million, as well as increased costs related to labor, materials and utilities and supply chain disruptions. PCC management continues to take actions to improve operations, maintain safety and prepare for increased demand for PCC’s products. Growth in PCC’s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace demand, including managing through the current supply chain and employment environments. Lubrizol’s revenues were approximately $1.7 billion in the third quarter and $5.1 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 6.5% in the third quarter and 2.4% in the first nine months compared to 2021. The revenue increases reflected higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower volumes and adverse foreign currency translation effects from the stronger U.S. Dollar. Sales volumes through the first nine months of 2022 were restricted by unplanned temporary maintenance shutdowns and raw material supply constraints, which limited Lubrizol’s production capabilities. The increase in average selling prices was driven by escalating prices for raw materials, including oil feedstocks, as well as for utilities, packaging, shipping and freight costs. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings increased $251 million in the third quarter and $249 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in earnings was driven by fire-related insurance recoveries in 2022, while earnings in 2021 were negatively impacted by significant losses related to a fire in June 2021 at a facility located in Rockton, Illinois and impairment charges in the third quarter of 2021 related to an underperforming business in the Advanced Materials product lines. Insurance recoveries related to a fire in 2019 at the Rouen, France facility and the Rockton, Illinois facility fire were $142 million in the third quarter and $242 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to $10 million of insurance recoveries in the third quarter and $55 million in the first nine months of 2021. The fire losses related to the Rockton, Illinois fire and impairment charges in 2021 aggregated $73 million in the third quarter and $229 million in the first nine months of 2021. Earnings in 2022 were also negatively impacted by rising raw material costs, lower sales volumes, higher expenses from the unplanned temporary maintenance shutdowns and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partially offset by higher selling prices. Earnings in 2021 were also negatively impacted by the weather-related temporary shut-down of Additives facilities in the U.S. in the first quarter, which resulted in lost sales and various incremental and non-recurring manufacturing and other operating costs. 37 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Marmon’s revenues were $2.7 billion in the third quarter and $8.1 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 4.3% in the third quarter and 12.8% in the first nine months compared to 2021. Nearly all of Marmon’s business groups generated higher revenues in the first nine months of 2022, led by significant increases in the Transportation, Metal Services, Industrial and Electrical products groups, which contributed approximately 76% of the increase. These increases generally reflected favorable volume and sales mix and higher metals prices, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Metals prices in the third quarter of 2022 began to moderate and in certain instances declined. Revenues of the Rail & Leasing group in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 declined versus 2021, due primarily to low product sales volumes and declining lease rates. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased 13.3% in the third quarter and 14.1% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in the first nine months of 2022 included losses of approximately $90 million in the Rail & Leasing group related to the shutdown in the second quarter of its business in Russia. In the first nine months of 2022, the Transportation, Metal Services, Plumbing, Electrical, Retail and Industrial Products groups contributed meaningful increases in earnings, due to a combination of higher sales volumes and margins. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing group. IMC’s revenues were $905 million in the third quarter and $2.8 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of 5.0% compared to the same periods in 2021. Revenues in 2022 reflected increased sales in several geographic regions, partially offset by lower revenues in Asia and effects from foreign currency translation and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. IMC’s pre-tax earnings decreased 1.3% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, as the revenue increases were more than offset by higher raw material costs, changes in sales mix and unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Revenues of the building products group increased $1.2 billion (19.1%) in the third quarter and $3.6 billion (19.6%) in the first nine months of 2022 and pre-tax earnings increased $403 million (48.4%) in the third quarter and $1.1 billion (43.1%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Our building products businesses have benefited in recent years from the low interest rate environment. However, interest rates in the U.S. increased significantly over the first nine months of 2022. As a result, the significant increase in home mortgage interest rates has slowed demand for new home construction. As such, comparative revenues and earnings in the near term will likely decline from current levels. Clayton Homes’ revenues increased 24.8% to $3.3 billion in the third quarter and 24.9% to $9.5 billion in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from home sales increased $1.8 billion (30.2%) in the first nine months of 2022, primarily due to higher average selling prices and increased volume. New home unit sales increased 9.5% in the first nine months of 2022, reflecting a 10.5% increase in factory-built manufactured home unit sales and a 5.4% increase in site-built home unit sales. We expect unit sales will likely decline in the near term, as a consequence of higher interest rates. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 4.1% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $20.4 billion as of September 30, 2022, an increase of approximately $1.6 billion from December 31, 2021. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes increased $249 million (63.8%) in the third quarter and $512 million (41.3%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 reflected higher home sales, gross margin rates and net interest income, as well as relatively low credit losses. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $4.3 billion in the third quarter and $12.5 billion in the first nine months of 2022, increases of $565 million (15.1%) in the third quarter and $1.7 billion (15.9%) in the first nine months versus 2021. The increases were primarily due to higher average selling prices, and to a lesser extent, from higher unit volumes in certain product lines and product mix changes. Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses increased $154 million (34.9%) in the third quarter and $600 million (44.9%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings as a percentage of revenues in the first nine months of 2022 increased 3.1 percentage points versus 2021. Earnings in 2022 benefitted from higher selling prices and strong demand in certain product categories, as well as a comparative increase in pre-tax gains from business divestitures and asset sales of $58 million in the third quarter and $169 million in the first nine months. The increase in earnings in 2022 also reflected the negative impact of severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021, which reduced sales and increased production and other operating costs. 38 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Consumer products The consumer products group includes recreational vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). Consumer products group revenues decreased $242 million (6.2%) in the third quarter and increased $903 million (7.9%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Forest River’s revenues declined 7.2% in the third quarter and increased 22.1% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Forest River’s unit sales declined 27.9% in the third quarter and 5.3% in the first nine months of 2022 versus 2021. The comparative decline in unit volume in the third quarter was attributable to reduced consumer demand. Over the first nine months of 2022, Forest River’s revenues reflected higher average selling prices, resulting from higher material prices and supply chain costs. Revenues of our apparel and footwear businesses declined $27 million (2.0%) in the third quarter and $165 million (4.2%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting lower revenues from apparel (5.6% in the third quarter and 8.5% in the first nine months), partly offset by higher revenues from footwear. The declines in apparel revenues were driven by lower volumes, as retailers reduced orders in response to rising inventories. Duracell’s revenues in first nine months of 2022 declined 6.9% versus 2021, primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar. Pre-tax earnings of our consumer products group declined $216 million (44.3%) in the third quarter and $324 million (21.4%) in the first nine months of 2022 versus 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 3.6 percentage points in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The declines in earnings in 2022 reflected lower aggregate earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses and from Duracell. The comparative decline in earnings in the first nine months was partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River. Apparel and footwear earnings declined about 75% in the third quarter and 58% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Our apparel businesses continue to be negatively affected by lower sales volumes, reduced manufacturing efficiencies and higher input costs, including raw materials, freight, labor and other operating costs. We expect that the comparative operating earnings will likely be lower in the fourth quarter, due to low customer demand and high costs. Duracell’s earnings in 2022 declined, primarily due to lower sales, cost inflation and foreign currency translation effects. Earnings from Forest River were essentially unchanged in the third quarter and higher in the first nine months of 2022, primarily due to the increase in unit sales in the first half of the year and higher average selling prices, partly offset by higher materials costs. We currently expect demand for recreational vehicles will continue to slow and Forest River’s comparative revenues and earnings to decline over the remainder of 2022 and into 2023. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenues Service $ 4,771 $ 4,131 $ 14,031 $ 11,718 Retailing 4,796 4,548 14,268 13,896 McLane 13,569 12,612 39,346 36,529 $ 23,136 $ 21,291 $ 67,645 $ 62,143 Pre-tax earnings Service $ 806 $ 696 $ 2,286 $ 2,013 Retailing 396 414 1,250 1,221 McLane 112 (8 ) 270 179 $ 1,314 $ 1,102 $ 3,806 $ 3,413 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Service 16.9 % 16.8 % 16.3 % 17.2 % Retailing 8.3 % 9.1 % 8.8 % 8.8 % McLane 0.8 % (0.1 )% 0.7 % 0.5 % 39 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Service group revenues increased $640 million (15.5%) in the third quarter and $2.3 billion (19.7%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from TTI increased 16.6% in the third quarter and 20.3% in the first nine months of 2022 versus 2021, reflecting strong demand in nearly all significant markets. However, during the third quarter of 2022, new orders slowed in certain regions and markets, in part attributable to inventory levels within the supply chain. Revenues from aviation services (NetJets and FlightSafety) increased 14.2% in the third quarter and 19.9% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increases reflected year-to-date increases in training hours (17%), customer flight hours (14%), most of which occurred in the first half of the year, and fuel surcharges to customers due to the increase in customer flight hours and significant increases in fuel prices. These increases were partially offset by the effects from changes in sales mix. Pre-tax earnings of the service group increased $110 million (15.8%) in the third quarter and $273 million (13.6%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 0.9 percentage points in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The earnings increase in the third quarter of 2022 was primarily attributable to aviation services, reflecting a significant comparative decline in subcontract aircraft utilization, and to a lesser extent, increased earnings from several of our other businesses. The comparative increase in earnings in the first nine months reflected higher earnings from TTI, primarily attributable to the increases in sales and improved operating cost leverage, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects in 2022 and a favorable legal settlement in 2021. Earnings from aviation services for the first nine months of 2022 decreased compared to 2021, attributable to a significant increase in subcontracted aircraft utilization due to the increase in customer flight hours in the first half of the year, and from higher equipment maintenance and other operating costs, which more than offset the increase in revenues. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), representing 66% of our combined retailing revenue in the first nine months of 2022. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also offers vehicle service contracts and operates two insurance businesses. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 20% of the combined retailing revenues in the first nine months of 2022. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. Retailing group revenues increased $248 million (5.5%) in the third quarter and $372 million (2.7%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021 reflecting increases at BHA, partially offset by combined lower revenues from our other retailers. BHA’s revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 increased 11.3% and 6.3%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. Revenues from new and used vehicle sales increased 10.9% in the third quarter and 5.4% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from vehicle sales reflected higher average vehicle transaction prices, partly offset by lower unit sales on a year-to-date comparative basis. Unit sales continue to be constrained by low new vehicle production by OEMs, attributable to the ongoing global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Revenues from service and repair and finance and service contract revenues each increased versus 2021. Retailing group pre-tax earnings decreased $18 million (4.3%) in the third quarter and increased $29 million (2.4%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 24.7% in the third quarter and 22.7% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to increases in vehicle gross profit margins and finance and service contract earnings per vehicle sold and from operating cost control efforts. BHA’s comparative new vehicle gross profit margin rates began to accelerate during the second half of 2021, as a consequence of low available inventory attributable to supply chain constraints impacting the OEMs. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group decreased $68 million (32.2%) in the third quarter and $103 million (15.9%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to declining earnings from the furniture retailers and Pampered Chef. 40 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised 61% of McLane’s consolidated sales in the first nine months of 2022, with foodservice representing most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues increased $957 million (7.6%) in the third quarter and $2.8 billion (7.7%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting year-to-date increases of 3.9% from the grocery business and 15.2% from the foodservice business. Pre-tax earnings increased $120 million in the third quarter and $91 million (50.8%) in the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases in earnings reflected slightly higher gross margin rates in the grocery and foodservice businesses, partly offset by higher personnel costs, fuel expense and insurance costs. McLane’s grocery and food service operating results continue to be adversely affected by supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages and higher inventory costs. We expect the current difficult operating environment to continue for the remainder of 2022. Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative contract gains/losses follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2022 2021 2022 2021 Investment gains (losses) $ (13,500 ) $ 4,851 $ (82,089 ) $ 37,235 Derivative contract gains (losses) 35 70 (273 ) 780 Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests (13,465 ) 4,921 (82,362 ) 38,015 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (3,016 ) 1,043 (17,295 ) 8,036 Net earnings (loss) $ (10,449 ) $ 3,878 $ (65,067 ) $ 29,979 Effective income tax rate 20.9 % 20.7 % 20.8 % 20.9 % Investment gains/losses Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Unrealized gains and losses also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in non-U.S. issuers that are held by our U.S. based subsidiaries. Pre-tax investment gains/losses included net unrealized losses of $12.9 billion in the third quarter and $80.5 billion in the first nine months of 2022 compared to net unrealized gains of $4.8 billion in the third quarter and $36.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Taxable investment gains/losses on equity securities sold is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost of the securities sold. Sales of equity securities produced taxable gains of $3 million in the third quarter and taxable losses of $660 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to taxable gains of $0.9 billion in the third quarter and $2.9 billion in the first nine months of 2021. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative contract gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our few remaining equity index put option contract liabilities. The gains and losses from the changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings. As of September 30, 2022, our recorded liability at fair value was less than $1 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under these contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined in the contracts. 41 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2022 2021 2022 2021 Equity method earnings $ 362 $ 310 $ 874 $ 665 Acquisition accounting expenses (161 ) (169 ) (484 ) (532 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (66 ) (75 ) (203 ) (232 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes 858 196 2,441 676 Other 48 87 207 76 $ 1,041 $ 349 $ 2,835 $ 653 After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia, Electric Transmission of Texas and Iroquois Gas Transmission Systems. Equity method earnings increased $209 million in the first nine months of 2022 versus 2021, primarily due to higher earnings from Kraft Heinz and Pilot. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, equity method earnings will also include Occidental Petroleum. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC’s Euro and Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. In 2022, we recorded significant foreign currency exchange rate gains on these debt issues, due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, which reduced the U.S Dollar carrying value of the debt. These gains were largely offset by losses included in investment gains/losses, pertaining to non-U.S. Dollar denominated investments held by our U.S. based subsidiaries. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other earnings/losses consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes. Financial Condition Our Consolidated Balance Sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity attributable to Berkshire shareholders at September 30, 2022 was $455.4 billion, a decrease of $50.8 billion since December 31, 2021. Net loss attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $41.0 billion in the first nine months of 2022, which included after-tax losses on our investments of $64.9 billion. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities will produce significant volatility in our earnings. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $5.2 billion in the first nine months of 2022 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. At September 30, 2022, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $105.2 billion, which included $77.9 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stock) were $324.8 billion. During the first nine months of 2022, we paid cash of $66.2 billion to acquire equities securities and we received proceeds of $17.3 billion from sales of equity securities. On October 19, 2022, we acquired Alleghany Corporation for cash consideration of $11.6 billion, which was funded by existing cash balances. Our consolidated borrowings at September 30, 2022 were $116.5 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. In the first nine months of 2022, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $10.2 billion in the aggregate and paid approximately $3.3 billion on maturing term debt. 42 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition (Continued) Berkshire parent company outstanding debt at September 30, 2022 was $19.2 billion, a decrease of $2.2 billion since December 31, 2021. In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $600 million of maturing senior notes and issued ¥128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. Berkshire’s borrowings decreased $2.7 billion in the first nine months of 2022 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on its non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Berkshire parent company debt maturities over the next twelve months approximate $4.2 billion, all of which is in the first six months of 2023. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $22.3 billion at September 30, 2022, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $17.6 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In March 2022, BHFC issued $4.5 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and issued €1.25 billion of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. Aggregate maturities of BHFC debt in the first nine months of 2022 were $775 million. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.3 billion as of September 30, 2022, an increase of $83 million from December 31, 2021. In June 2022, BNSF issued $1.0 billion of 4.45% debentures due in 2053. During the first nine months of 2022, BNSF repaid approximately $900 million of term debt. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $51.7 billion at September 30, 2022, a decrease of $112 million from December 31, 2021. In April 2022, BHE issued $1.0 billion of 4.6% senior notes due in 2053, and during the first nine months of 2022, subsidiaries issued approximately $1.3 billion of fixed and variable rate term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.9% as of September 30, 2022 and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2052. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $3.6 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. In the first nine months of 2022, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of approximately $27.0 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $10.9 billion in the first nine months of 2022, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $7.9 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Forecasted capital expenditures for BHE and BNSF over the remainder of 2022 approximate $3.7 billion. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“the 2022 act”) was signed into law. The 2022 act contains numerous provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax on “adjusted financial statement income”, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The provisions of the 2022 act become effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We currently do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, we expect future guidance from the Treasury Department and will continue to evaluate the impact of the Act as more guidance becomes available. Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were $128.3 billion at September 30, 2022. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of September 30, 2022, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. 43 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations (Continued) On March 20, 2022, we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Alleghany common stock for cash consideration of approximately $11.6 billion. On October 19, 2022, the acquisition of Alleghany closed. We also have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% of Pilot in 2023 and agreements to acquire certain non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries as described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2022 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022 includes estimated liabilities of $128.3 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.3 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.4 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2021. In connection with that annual goodwill impairment review, the estimated fair values of five reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $34.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $31.1 billion by 10.7%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the four other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $2.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.3 billion by 9.2%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.2 billion. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. As of September 30, 2022, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts and changes in business conditions on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently anticipate, and we may need to record goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units and judgments on goodwill impairments at this time are and will likely continue to be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of adverse events on a reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 44 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; the adverse impacts from geopolitical events; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of September 30, 2022, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Ris k Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. 45 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use o f Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the third quarter of 2022 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program July Class A common stock 1,302 $ 424,974.96 1,302 * Class B common stock — $ — — * August Class A common stock 595 $ 444,401.28 595 * Class B common stock — $ — — * September Class A common stock 519 $ 424,972.62 519 * Class B common stock — $ — — * * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $30 billion.

General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the magnitude of asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. To varying degrees, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus. Actions in the latter part of 2021 and during 2022 included temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world in response to the emergence of variants of the virus. Notwithstanding these efforts, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs have persisted in 2022. Further, the development of geopolitical conflicts in 2022 have contributed to disruptions of supply chains, resulting in cost increases for commodities, goods and services in many parts of the world. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2. New accounting pronouncements In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2018-12”). ASU 2018-12 requires reassessment of cash flow assumptions at least annually and revision of discount rate assumptions each reporting period in valuing policyholder liabilities of long-duration contracts. Under ASU 2018-12, the effects from changes in cash flow assumptions are reflected in earnings and the effects from changes in discount rate assumptions are reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the cash flow and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 is to be applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented in the financial statements, will require new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt ASU 2018-12 as of January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method, whereby revised cash flow and discount rate assumptions as of January 1, 2021 (the transition date) are applied to contracts then in-force, with liabilities then remeasured as provided under the standard. The cumulative effects from discount rate assumption changes as of the transition date will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and the cumulative effect from cash flow assumption changes will be recorded in retained earnings. While we have not finalized our assessment of the impact of the adoption as of the transition date, we currently believe that the changes in discount rate assumptions will have a greater effect on our recorded liabilities than changes in cash flow assumptions. We currently estimate that as of January 1, 2021, the adoption of ASU 2018-12 will reduce our consolidated shareholders’ equity between $ 6 billion and $ 7 billion from the amount previously reported, primarily due to the low interest rate environment at that time. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2018-12 will be based on the discount rate and cash flow assumptions determined as of the January 1, 2023 adoption date. We, therefore, continue to evaluate the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 7 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.

Investments in equity securities (Continued) As of June 30, 2022, we owned 151.6 million shares of American Express Company (“American Express”) common stock representing 20.2 % of the American Express outstanding common stock. Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors and agreed to passivity commitments to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we have not applied the equity method of accounting with respect to our investment in American Express and continue to record our investment at fair value. Our equity security investments also include Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $ 10 billion and warrants to purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $ 59.62 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8 % per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends and is mandatorily redeemable under specified events. Dividends on the preferred stock are payable in cash or, at Occidental’s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. During the first six months of 2022, we also acquired approximately 17 % of the outstanding common stock of Occidental, which had a fair value of $ 9.3 billion as of June 30, 2022. Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 26.6 % of the outstanding shares of Kraft Heinz common stock. We recorded equity method earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz of $ 71 million in the second quarter and $ 277 million in the first six months of 2022. We recorded an equity method loss of $ 7 million in the second quarter and earnings of $ 143 million in the first six months of 2021. We received dividends on the common stock of $ 260 million in the first six months of both 2022 and 2021, which were recorded as reductions to the carrying value of our investment. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $ 12.4 billion at June 30, 2022 and $ 11.7 billion at December 31, 2021. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $ 13.0 billion at June 30, 2022 and $ 13.1 billion at December 31, 2021. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying value of our investment exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by 5 % of the carrying value. We evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment as of June 30, 2022. Based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, we concluded recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required.

We recorded equity method earnings from these entities in the first six months of $ 330 million in 2022 and $ 255 million in 2021. We received aggregate distributions in the first six months of $ 137 million in 2022 and $ 982 million in 2021, including a special distribution received from Pilot of $ 849 million in the first quarter of 2021. Additional information concerning these investments follows. 9 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5.

Berkadia provides capital solutions, investment sales advisory and mortgage servicing for multifamily and commercial real estate. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through commercial paper, which was $ 1.47 billion at June 30, 2022 and is limited to $ 1.5 billion. Berkadia’s commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) subsidiaries own 50 % noncontrolling interests in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in Texas, and Iroquois, which owns and operates a natural gas pipeline located in New York and Connecticut. We own a 38.6 % interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot operates travel centers in North America through more than 800 retail locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces and is a leading supplier of fuel to third parties. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1 % interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining 11.3 % interest. We have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4 % interest in Pilot in 2023, with the Haslam family retaining a 20 % interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023. Note 6. Investment and derivative contract gains/losses Investment and derivative contract gains/losses in the second quarter and first six months of 2022 and 2021 are summarized as follows (in millions).

As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $ 12.0 billion in the first six months of 2022 and $ 8.6 billion in the first six months of 2021. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the period represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable period or, if later, the purchase date. Taxable gains/losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Equity securities sold produced taxable gains of $ 76 million in the second quarter of 2022 and taxable losses of $ 663 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to taxable gains of $ 228 million in the second quarter and $ 2.0 billion in the first six months of 2021. Our derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. As of June 30, 2022, we had six open contracts, which had an aggregate fair value liability of $ 186 million and an aggregate notional value of $ 2.5 billion. 10 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7.

Note 13. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 14), for each of the six-month periods ending June 30, 2022 and 2021 follows (in millions). 2022 2021 Balances at beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 86,664 $ 79,854 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 2,960 ) ( 2,912 ) Net liabilities 83,704 76,942 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year 27,427 23,651 Prior accident years ( 887 ) ( 1,064 ) Total 26,540 22,587 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year ( 10,085 ) ( 8,406 ) Prior accident years ( 13,820 ) ( 11,169 ) Total ( 23,905 ) ( 19,575 ) Foreign currency effect ( 568 ) 31 Balances at June 30: Net liabilities 85,771 79,985 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 2,789 2,973 Gross liabilities $ 88,560 $ 82,958 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. In the first six months, we recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 887 million in 2022 and $ 1.1 billion in 2021, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 1.1 % in 2022 and 1.4 % in 2021. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years from primary insurance in the first six months were reduced by $ 313 million in 2022 and $ 1.1 billion in 2021. The reductions in each period derived primarily from private passenger automobile, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims and in 2022 were partly offset by increases in ultimate liabilities for other casualty claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years attributable to property and casualty reinsurance in the first six months decreased $ 574 million in 2022 and increased $ 35 million in 2021. 14 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charges for each of the six-month periods ending June 30, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions). 2022 2021 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges - retroactive reinsurance Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges - retroactive reinsurance Balances at beginning of year $ 38,256 $ ( 10,639 ) $ 40,966 $ ( 12,441 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current year contracts — — 82 — Prior years’ contracts ( 14 ) 426 ( 3 ) 473 Total ( 14 ) 426 79 473 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 1,008 ) — ( 808 ) — Balances at June 30 $ 37,234 $ ( 10,213 ) $ 40,237 $ ( 11,968 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 412 $ 552 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposure to losses began. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months for prior years’ contracts were $ 412 million in 2022 and $ 470 million in 2021 and included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments. Currently, our largest retroactive reinsurance contract is between our subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, and certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”). Our estimated claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $ 15.2 billion at June 30, 2022 and $ 15.8 billion at December 31, 2021. Deferred charges related to the AIG contract were $ 4.24 billion at June 30, 2022 and $ 4.45 billion at December 31, 2021. Note 15.

Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $ 600 million of maturing senior notes and issued ¥ 128.5 billion (approximately $ 1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5 %. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In March 2022, BHFC issued $ 4.5 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4 % and € 1.25 billion (approximately $ 1.4 billion) of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8 %. In May 2022, BHFC repaid $ 775 million of maturing senior notes. The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 8.15 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 914 billion par at June 30, 2022) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $ 1.4 billion in the second quarter and $ 2.1 billion in the first six months of 2022 as compared to pre-tax losses of $ 45 million in the second quarter and pre-tax gains of $ 675 million in the first six months of 2021. Berkshire also guarantees debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $ 3.8 billion at June 30, 2022. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.

Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In April 2022, BHE issued $ 1.0 billion of 4.6 % senior notes due in 2053 . During the first six months of 2022, BHE subsidiaries issued approximately $ 1.3 billion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.5 % and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2052 . BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In June 2022, BNSF issued $ 1.0 billion of 4.45 % debentures due in 2053 . During the first six months of 2022, BNSF repaid $ 800 million of term debt. As of June 30, 2022, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries have unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $ 10.3 billion at June 30, 2022, which included approximately $ 8.8 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 16 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16. Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, other receivables and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of their fair values.

Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions).

These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. 18 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 17. Common stock Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the first six months of 2022 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Class A, $ 5 Par Value ( 1,650,000 shares authorized) Class B, $ 0.0033 Par Value ( 3,225,000,000 shares authorized) Issued Treasury Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding Balances at December 31, 2021 665,901 ( 48,788 ) 617,113 1,488,292,852 ( 197,818,349 ) 1,290,474,503 Conversions of Class A common stock to Class B common stock ( 11,544 ) — ( 11,544 ) 17,316,000 — 17,316,000 Treasury stock acquired — ( 4,402 ) ( 4,402 ) — ( 6,850,133 ) ( 6,850,133 ) Balances at June 30, 2022 654,357 ( 53,190 ) 601,167 1,505,608,852 ( 204,668,482 ) 1,300,940,370 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,468,461 shares outstanding as of June 30, 2022 and 1,477,429 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times the average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $ 30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note 18. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were 21.8 % in the second quarter and 22.4 % in the first six months of 2022 compared to 20.4 % in the second quarter and 19.9 % in the first six months of 2021. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in certain equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, including investment gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. 19 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”) entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger dated as of March 20, 2022 , whereby Berkshire will acquire all of Alleghany’s outstanding common stock for cash of approximately $ 11.6 billion. The Alleghany shareholders voted to approve and adopt the agreement and plan of merger on June 9, 2022. The acquisition of Alleghany is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022 and is subject to the receipt of various regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Alleghany owns property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses as well as a diverse portfolio of non-financial businesses. In June 2022, BHE acquired the BHE common stock held by Greg Abel, Berkshire’s Vice Chairman - non-insurance operations, for $ 870 million. The purchase was pursuant to the terms of a shareholders agreement between Berkshire, BHE and BHE’s non-controlling shareholders. Berkshire recorded a charge of $ 362 million to capital in excess of par value for the excess of the consideration paid over the carrying value of the acquired noncontrolling interest. 20 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 22. Revenues from contracts with customers We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the second quarter and first six months of 2022 and 2021 (in millions). Other revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP, are primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines and marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. Revenues and earnings before income taxes by segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings/loss attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2022 2021 2022 2021 Insurance – underwriting $ 581 $ 376 $ 628 $ 1,140 Insurance – investment income 1,906 1,219 3,076 2,427 Railroad 1,664 1,516 3,035 2,767 Utilities and energy 766 740 1,516 1,443 Manufacturing, service and retailing 3,249 3,004 6,274 5,623 Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) (53,038 ) 21,408 (54,618 ) 26,101 Other 1,117 (169 ) 1,794 304 Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ (43,755 ) $ 28,094 $ (38,295 ) $ 39,805 Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. In varying degrees, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus. Actions in the latter part of 2021 and during 2022 included periodic temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world in response to the emergence of variants of the virus. Notwithstanding these efforts, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs have persisted. Further, geopolitical conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have developed in 2022. While direct losses to-date have not been material to consolidated results, these events had indirect impacts by contributing to the disruptions of global supply chains, resulting in cost increases for goods and services in parts of the world where we operate. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of these events on our businesses or when our operations will normalize. Nor can we reliably predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Insurance underwriting after-tax earnings increased $205 million (54.5%) in the second quarter and decreased $512 million (44.9%) in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021. In each period, underwriting earnings from GEICO declined, primarily attributable to increases in claims frequencies and severities and lower reductions of ultimate claim estimates for prior years’ losses. Underwriting earnings in 2022 from reinsurance activities increased compared to 2021, reflecting foreign currency exchange rate gains arising from the remeasurement of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities on insurance contracts of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar and improved life results. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased 56.4% in the second quarter and 26.7% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to increased dividend income and higher interest rates. After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 9.8% in the second quarter and 9.7% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. These increases reflected higher revenue per car/unit, partly offset by lower overall freight volumes and higher fuel costs. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 3.5% in the second quarter and 5.1% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases reflected higher earnings from tax equity investments and from the natural gas pipeline and Northern Powergrid businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from the U.S. regulated utilities and real estate brokerage businesses. After-tax earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 8.2% in the second quarter and 11.6% in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021. Results were mixed among our various businesses. While customer demand for products and services was relatively good in the first six months of 2022, we continue to experience the negative effects of higher materials, freight, labor and other input costs. Investment and derivative contract gains and losses in 2022 and 2021 predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and includes unrealized gains and losses from market price changes during the period. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or in evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Other earnings included after-tax foreign currency exchange gains related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt of $1.1 billion in the second quarter and $1.6 billion in the first six months of 2022, compared to after-tax losses of $45 million and after-tax gains of $480 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2021, respectively. 24 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett, and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the quarterly or annual operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding $100 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in the first six months included floods in Australia and South Africa in 2022 and Winter Storm Uri in 2021. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $126 billion as of June 30, 2022. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Underwriting results of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses have been affected by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. While the effects of the pandemic on underwriting results in the first six months of 2022 were insignificant, results in future periods may be affected by legal and regulatory actions pertaining to insurance coverage, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2022 2021 2022 2021 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss): GEICO $ (487 ) $ 626 $ (665 ) $ 1,649 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 242 166 334 372 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 967 (327 ) 1,123 (590 ) Pre-tax underwriting earnings 722 465 792 1,431 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 141 89 164 291 Net underwriting earnings $ 581 $ 376 $ 628 $ 1,140 Effective income tax rate 19.4 % 19.0 % 20.7 % 20.3 % GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting loss in the first half of 2022 reflected increased claims severities, primarily due to significant cost inflation in automobile markets, which began to accelerate in the second half of 2021. Increases in used car prices are producing increased claims severities on total losses and shortages of car parts are contributing to increased claims severities on partial losses. In addition, injury claims severities continue to trend higher than general inflation rates. Premiums written increased $186 million (2.0%) in the second quarter and $445 million (2.3%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases were primarily attributable to increases in average premiums per auto policy due to rate increases, partially offset by a decrease in policies in-force. Premiums earned increased $261 million (2.7%) in the second quarter and $892 million (4.8%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Premiums earned in the first six months of 2021 included a reduction of approximately $460 million attributable to the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback program that provided a 15% premium credit to new and renewing voluntary auto and motorcycle policies written between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $1.5 billion (19.5%) in the second quarter and $3.6 billion (25.3%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned was 92.8% in the second quarter and 91.2% in the first six months of 2022, increases of 13.0 percentage points and 15.0 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, which reflected increases in claims frequencies and severities for the current year and lower reductions of loss estimates for prior years’ loss events. Claims frequencies in the first six months of 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (four to five percent range), collision (ten to eleven percent range), bodily injury (six to seven percent range) and personal injury (seven to eight percent range). Average claims severities in the first six months of 2022 were higher for property damage coverage (eleven to twelve percent range), collision coverage (nineteen to twenty percent range) and bodily injury coverage (nine to eleven percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ loss events of $207 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to $846 million in the first six months of 2021. The reductions in 2022 reflected decreases for bodily and personal injury coverages, partially offset by increases for collision and property damage coverages, while the reductions in 2021 were across all major coverages. Underwriting expenses decreased $114 million (8.7%) in the second quarter and $363 million (13.2%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting lower advertising costs in both periods and lower employee-related costs in the first six months. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 12.2% in the second quarter and first six months of 2022, decreases of 1.4 percentage points and 2.7 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, attributable to both the decreases in expenses as well as the increases in earned premiums. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary’s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”). A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

The increases were primarily on property and casualty coverages in the U.S. across several markets. 26 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) BH Primary’s loss ratio was 67.7% in the second quarter and 70.2% in the first six months of 2022, a decrease of 3.3 percentage points in the second quarter and relatively unchanged in the first six months compared to 2021. Losses and loss adjustment expenses from significant catastrophe events were $75 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to $156 million in 2021. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $106 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to $253 million in 2021. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of workers’ compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. We could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Underwriting expenses increased $194 million (30.6%) in the second quarter and $347 million (28.1%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The expense ratio increased 2.0 percentage points in the second quarter and 1.8 percentage points in the first six months compared to 2021. These increases reflected costs associated with new business development and changes in business mix. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity business due to the expected long durations of the claim liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such business, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) Premiums written increased $733 million (21.4%) in the second quarter and $736 million (9.4%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, reflecting net increases from new property business and rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $229 million (10.0%) in the second quarter and $329 million (7.0%) in the first six months, while the loss ratio declined 10.0 percentage points in the second quarter and 6.6 percentage points in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Losses incurred arising from significant catastrophe events were $443 million in the second quarter and $758 million in the first six months of 2022, which were partially offset by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $437 million in the second quarter and $574 million in the first six months. Losses incurred from significant catastrophe events were $108 million in the second quarter and $418 million in the first six months of 2021. Changes in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events were relatively insignificant in the second quarter and first six months of 2021. Underwriting expenses as percentages of premiums earned decreased 11.6 percentage points in the second quarter and 7.8 percentage points in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to foreign currency effects and changes in business mix. Underwriting expenses included foreign currency exchange gains of $308 million in the second quarter and $389 million in the first six months of 2022, primarily related to a third quarter 2021 intercompany reinsurance agreement in which a non-U.S. based Berkshire subsidiary ceded non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities to a U.S. based Berkshire subsidiary. Under U.S. GAAP, the effects of exchange rate changes from the remeasurement of liabilities assumed by the U.S. subsidiary are reflected in earnings as its functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. The net foreign currency exchange rate effects from translating the financial statements of the non-U.S. subsidiary to the U.S. Dollar are included in other comprehensive income. Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Life and health benefits declined $271 million (21.9%) in the second quarter and $471 million (18.9%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to lower mortality. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively affected by significant, pandemic-related increases in mortality in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America. Retroactive reinsurance Pre-tax underwriting losses in each period derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign currency exchange gains were $157 million in the first six months of 2022, substantially all of which was in the second quarter. Foreign currency exchange gains/losses were insignificant in the corresponding 2021 periods. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $204 million in the second quarter and $399 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to $220 million in the second quarter and $463 million in the first six months of 2021. Unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $1.0 billion in the first six months of 2022 to $37.2 billion at June 30, 2022, primarily due to loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $426 million in the first six months of 2022 to $10.2 billion at June 30, 2022, primarily attributable to periodic amortization. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. 28 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned increased $45 million (36.6%) in the second quarter and $70 million (26.2%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and interest rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency gains of $116 million in the second quarter and $160 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to losses of $10 million in the second quarter and $20 million in the first six months of 2021. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $143 million in the second quarter and $290 million in the first six months of 2022 and $134 million in the second quarter and $260 million in the first six months of 2021. Discounted annuity liabilities were $15.4 billion at June 30, 2022 and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax losses of $5 million in the second quarter and gains of $51 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to pre-tax gains of $4 million in the second quarter and $125 million in the first six months of 2021. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting earnings in the first six months of 2022 and 2021 were primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate changes and changes in securities markets which were unfavorable in 2022 and favorable in 2021. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months Percentage Change 2022 2021 2022 2021 Second Quarter First Six Months Dividend income $ 2,055 $ 1,298 $ 3,252 $ 2,551 58.3 % 27.5 % Interest and other investment income 228 158 392 317 44.3 23.7 Pre-tax net investment income 2,283 1,456 3,644 2,868 56.8 27.1 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 377 237 568 441 Net investment income $ 1,906 $ 1,219 $ 3,076 $ 2,427 Effective income tax rate 16.5 % 16.3 % 15.6 % 15.4 % Dividend income increased 58.3% in the second quarter and 27.5% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases in 2022 reflected an overall increase in equity security investments during the first six months of 2022. Dividend income also varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Dividend income included $13 million in the second quarter and $29 million in the first six months of 2022 and $37 million in the second quarter and $75 million in the first six months of 2021 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Interest and other investment income increased 44.3% in the second quarter and 23.7% in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases were primarily due to increases in short-term interest rates. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. While exceptionally low interest rates prevailed in recent years, interest rates began to increase during 2022. The effects of such increases are expected to be reflected in our earnings as maturing investments are replaced by new investments. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. 29 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $147 billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first six months of 2022 and 2021, and consequently, the average cost of float for each period was negative. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 follows (in millions).

Railroad operating revenues reflected lower volumes of 5.6% in the second quarter and 4.5% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings increased 8.7% in the second quarter and 8.9% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Operating revenues from consumer products were $2.5 billion in the second quarter and $4.5 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 17.6% and 14.1%, respectively, from 2021. The increases reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume decreases of 7.4% in the second quarter and 7.9% in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021. The volume decreases were primarily due to lower international intermodal shipments resulting from supply chain disruptions, partially offset by modest increases in domestic intermodal and automotive volumes. Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.5 billion in the second quarter and $2.8 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 7.8% and 6.9%, respectively, from 2021. The increases reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume decreases of 3.9% in the second quarter and 1.6% in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021. The volume decreases were primarily due to a decrease in petroleum shipments related to lower demand for crude by rail and network challenges, with the decrease in the first six months partially offset by increased volumes in other product categories. Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.4 billion in the second quarter and $2.7 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 9.1% and 6.4%, respectively, compared to 2021. The increases were primarily attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by decreased volumes of 3.2% in the second quarter and 3.6% in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021. The volume decreases were primarily due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of renewable diesel and oil feedstocks. Operating revenues from coal were $1.0 billion in the second quarter and $1.9 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 30.2% and 29.9%, respectively, from 2021. The increases were primarily attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes decreased 2.9% in the second quarter primarily due to network challenges, while volumes increased 5.0% in the first six months of 2022 due to increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand. Railroad operating expenses were $4.1 billion in the second quarter and $7.8 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of $687 million (20.3%) and $1.1 billion (16.3%), respectively, compared to 2021, primarily due to significant increases in the cost of fuel, as well as higher compensation and benefits expenses. Our ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 2.8 percentage points to 63.2% in the second quarter and 1.9 percentage points to 63.9% in the first six months of 2022 versus the comparable 2021 periods. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $68 million (5.9%) in the second quarter and $128 million (5.5%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to wage inflation, health and welfare costs and lower productivity. Fuel expenses increased $583 million (84.1%) in the second quarter and $894 million (71.9%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher fuel prices, partially offset by lower volumes. 31 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy We currently own 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. BHE subsidiaries also operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid in Great Britain. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“LNG interest”), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments. BHE also operates a residential real estate brokerage business and a large network of residential real estate brokerage franchises in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are largely based on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 4,940 $ 4,301 $ 9,763 $ 9,150 Real estate operating revenue 1,672 1,763 2,879 2,995 Other income (loss) (94 ) 21 (141 ) (136 ) Total revenue 6,518 6,085 12,501 12,009 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 1,525 1,110 2,985 2,679 Energy operating expense 2,343 2,134 4,496 4,170 Real estate operating costs and expense 1,555 1,584 2,734 2,704 Interest expense 531 518 1,046 1,034 Total costs and expense 5,954 5,346 11,261 10,587 Pre-tax earnings 564 739 1,240 1,422 Income tax expense (benefit)* (421 ) (212 ) (704 ) (444 ) Net earnings after income taxes 985 951 1,944 1,866 Noncontrolling interests of BHE subsidiaries 120 102 229 208 Net earnings attributable to BHE 865 849 1,715 1,658 Noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends 99 109 199 215 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 766 $ 740 $ 1,516 $ 1,443 Effective income tax rate (74.6 )% (28.7 )% (56.8 )% (31.2 )% * Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (Continued) PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. After-tax earnings decreased $143 million in the second quarter and $182 million in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021. The decreases reflected higher operating expenses and lower income tax benefits mainly from lower production tax credits recognized, partially offset by slight increases in utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales). The increases in operating expenses reflected higher costs associated with wildfires, higher general and plant maintenance costs and incremental costs from additional assets placed in-service. PacifiCorp’s utility margin was $863 million in the second quarter and $1.7 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of $6 million and $20 million, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2021. The increases reflected higher operating revenue from favorable retail and wholesale pricing, partially offset by lower operating revenue from decreases in retail customer volumes and higher thermal generation costs. Retail customer volumes decreased 3.3% in the second quarter and 0.7% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather and lower customer usage, partially offset by an increase in the average number of customers. MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings decreased $7 million in the second quarter and increased $90 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase for the first six months reflected higher electric utility margin and increased income tax benefits, partly offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses included higher costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms as well as incremental costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. The income tax benefit increase was mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, partially offset by the impacts of ratemaking. MEC’s electric utility margin was $551 million in the second quarter and $1.0 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 14% and 18%, respectively, versus 2021. The increases were attributable to higher operating revenue from increased retail and wholesale customer volumes and favorable wholesale pricing, partially offset by higher purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes increased 3.3% in the second quarter and 4.4% in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to higher customer usage and the favorable impact of weather. NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings decreased $7 million in the second quarter and $12 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The decreases reflected higher operating expenses from increased plant operations and maintenance expenses, higher comparative accruals for earnings sharing and incremental costs from additional assets placed in-service. NV Energy’s electric utility margin was $404 million in the second quarter and $710 million in the first six months of 2022, relatively unchanged compared to 2021. Electric retail customer volumes increased 0.4% in the second quarter and 2.0% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers and higher customer usage, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather. Northern Powergrid’s after-tax earnings increased $96 million in the second quarter and $103 million in the first six months of 2022 as compared to 2021, reflecting the impact on deferred income taxes in 2021 from an increase in the United Kingdom income tax rate, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2022. Earnings in each period of 2021 included deferred income tax expense of $109 million related to the enactment in June 2021 of an increase in the United Kingdom income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings increased $88 million in the second quarter and $14 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases were primarily due to higher earnings at BHE GT&S, largely from favorable state income tax adjustments, the impacts of an agreement in principle related to a general rate case and lower operating expenses. The year-to-date increase was offset by higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue in the first quarter of 2021 due to an increase in demand as a result of the February 2021 winter storms. Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings increased $81 million in the second quarter and $192 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases in earnings were primarily due to increased wind tax equity investment earnings of $40 million in the second quarter and $158 million in the first six months of 2022 as well as from higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects. The increases in wind tax equity investment earnings reflected increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. The comparative increase in year-to-date earnings also reflected the impact of significant losses in the first quarter of 2021 on pre-existing tax equity investments due to the February 2021 winter storms. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings decreased $51 million in the second quarter and $114 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The decreases in earnings were primarily attributable to lower earnings from mortgage services due to a decrease in funded volume and in refinancing activity, and lower earnings from brokerage and settlement services from a decrease in closed units at existing companies. 33 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (Continued) Corporate interest and other after-tax losses increased $41 million in the second quarter and $34 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting lower federal income tax credits recognized, partially offset by higher earnings from non-regulated energy services in the first six months. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months Percentage Change 2022 2021 2022 2021 Second Quarter First Six Months Revenues Manufacturing $ 19,772 $ 17,412 $ 38,193 $ 33,325 13.6 % 14.6 % Service and retailing 22,879 21,272 44,509 40,852 7.6 9.0 $ 42,651 $ 38,684 $ 82,702 $ 74,177 Pre-tax earnings Manufacturing $ 3,028 $ 2,714 $ 5,852 $ 5,150 11.6 % 13.6 % Service and retailing 1,275 1,270 2,492 2,311 0.4 7.8 4,303 3,984 8,344 7,461 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,054 980 2,070 1,838 Net earnings* $ 3,249 $ 3,004 $ 6,274 $ 5,623 Effective income tax rate 24.0 % 24.1 % 24.3 % 24.1 % Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues 10.1 % 10.3 % 10.1 % 10.1 % * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, primarily related to the amortization of identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings were $162 million in the second quarter and $323 million in the first six months of 2022 and $183 million in the second quarter and $363 million in the first six months of 2021. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page 24 and in the “Other” earnings section on page 40. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of these operations follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenues Industrial products $ 7,714 $ 7,186 $ 15,189 $ 13,858 Building products 7,710 6,402 14,422 12,030 Consumer products 4,348 3,824 8,582 7,437 $ 19,772 $ 17,412 $ 38,193 $ 33,325 Pre-tax earnings Industrial products $ 1,270 $ 1,242 $ 2,486 $ 2,384 Building products 1,307 973 2,451 1,743 Consumer products 451 499 915 1,023 $ 3,028 $ 2,714 $ 5,852 $ 5,150 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Industrial products 16.5 % 17.3 % 16.4 % 17.2 % Building products 17.0 % 15.2 % 17.0 % 14.5 % Consumer products 10.4 % 13.0 % 10.7 % 13.8 % 34 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)) and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Revenues of the industrial products group increased $528 million (7.3%) in the second quarter and $1.3 billion (9.6%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings increased $28 million (2.3%) in the second quarter and $102 million (4.3%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 16.4% for the first six months of 2022, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points compared to 2021. Operating results in 2022 were negatively affected by a combination of higher materials and energy costs, manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages and asset impairment charges, which largely offset the impacts of increased average selling prices and increased demand for certain product categories. Operating results of this group’s international businesses were also negatively impacted in 2022 by the stronger U.S. Dollar. PCC’s revenues were $1.8 billion in the second quarter and $3.6 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 13.3% in the second quarter and 13.0% in the first six months compared to 2021. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from sales of aerospace products. The revenue increases in 2022 were primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products, and to a lesser extent, general industrial products. While commercial air travel increased in both the U.S. and international markets, traffic remains below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products. However, further recovery likely will continue to be uneven, attributable in part to travel restrictions imposed from time-to-time to control the spread of variants of the COVID-19 virus, as well as from the changes in supply chain conditions, including the availability of workers. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by original equipment manufacturers of narrow-body aircraft have rebounded since the onset of the pandemic. However, deliveries of wide-body aircraft remain relatively low, in part attributable to the pause in the Boeing 787 program, as it works through production quality issues. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased $7 million in the second quarter and $24 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting the impact of increased revenues, substantially offset by a year-to-date reduction in pension plan income of $29 million, materials and utilities cost inflation and manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to worker shortages. PCC management continues to take actions to improve operations, maintain safety and prepare for increased demand for PCC’s products. Growth in PCC’s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to increase production levels to match the significant growth in aerospace demand, as well as resolution of the quality issues associated with the Boeing 787. Lubrizol’s revenues were approximately $1.7 billion in the second quarter and $3.4 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 3.5% in the second quarter and 0.5% in the first six months compared to 2021. The revenue increases reflected higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Sales volumes through the first half of 2022 were restricted by raw material supply constraints and unplanned temporary maintenance shutdowns, which limited Lubrizol’s production capabilities. The increase in average selling prices was due to escalating prices for raw materials, including oil feedstocks, as well as for utilities, packaging, shipping and freight costs. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings increased 60.2% in the second quarter and were relatively unchanged in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in the second quarter of 2021 included property losses, asset impairment charges and containment and response costs of approximately $160 million in connection with a fire at its Chemtool facility in Rockton, Illinois in June 2021. Earnings in 2021 were also negatively impacted by the weather-related temporary shut-down of Additives facilities in the U.S. in the first quarter, which resulted in lost sales and various incremental and non-recurring manufacturing and other operating costs. Earnings in 2022 included a comparative increase in insurance recoveries in connection with fires at facilities in 2021 and 2020 and were negatively impacted by rising raw material costs, lower sales volumes, and higher expenses from the unplanned temporary shutdowns, partially offset by higher selling prices. 35 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Marmon’s revenues were $2.8 billion in the second quarter and $5.4 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 10.3% in the second quarter and 17.5% in the first six months compared to 2021. The Transportation, Metal Services, Retail and Electrical groups generated significant revenue increases in the first six months of 2022, primarily attributable to higher volumes and average metals prices. These groups contributed approximately 70% of Marmon’s aggregate revenue increase in the first six months. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings decreased 5.8% in the second quarter and increased 14.6% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in the second quarter of 2022 included losses of approximately $90 million in the Rail & Leasing group related to the shutdown of its business in Russia. In the first six months of 2022, the Transportation, Metal Services, Retail, Electrical and Industrial Products groups contributed meaningful increases in earnings, due to a combination of higher sales volumes and margins and ongoing cost management, partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing group. IMC’s revenues were $930 million in the second quarter and $1.9 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of 1.7% in the second quarter and 5.0% in the first six months compared to 2021. Revenues in 2022 reflected increased sales in several geographic regions, partially offset by lower revenues in Asia and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC’s pre-tax earnings decreased 9.6% in the second quarter and 1.0% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, as the revenue increases were more than offset by higher raw material costs and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Revenues of the building products group increased $1.3 billion (20.4%) in the second quarter and $2.4 billion (19.9%) in the first six months of 2022 and pre-tax earnings increased $334 million (34.3%) in the second quarter and $708 million (40.6%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Residential home construction in the U.S. continued to be relatively strong throughout the first half of 2022. During the first half of 2022, interest rates in the U.S. increased significantly compared to the previous low-rate environment. The increases in home mortgage interest rates will very likely slow demand for new home construction, which could adversely impact our businesses. We also continue to be negatively affected by persistent supply chain disruptions and significant cost increases for many raw materials and other inputs, including energy, freight and labor. Clayton Homes’ revenues increased 28.1% to $3.4 billion in the second quarter and 25.0% to $6.2 billion in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from home sales increased $1.2 billion (30.5%) in the first six months of 2022, primarily due to higher average selling prices and increased volume. New home unit sales also increased 9.8% in the first six months of 2022, reflecting an 11.3% increase in higher factory-built manufactured home unit sales and a 3.1% increase in site-built home unit sales. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 4.3% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $20.0 billion as of June 30, 2022, an increase of approximately $1.2 billion from December 31, 2021. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes increased $168 million (36.9%) in the second quarter and $262 million (30.9%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 reflected higher home sales, gross margins and net interest income and relatively low credit losses. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $4.3 billion in the second quarter and $8.2 billion in the first six months of 2022, increases of $555 million (14.9%) in the second quarter and $1.1 billion (16.3%) in the first six months versus 2021. The increases were primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by higher input and transportation costs, and to a lesser extent, from higher unit volumes and product mix changes. Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses increased $166 million (32.1%) in the second quarter and $446 million (49.8%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings as a percentage of revenues in the first six months of 2022 increased 3.7 percentage points versus 2021. Year-to-date earnings in 2022 benefitted from an increase in pre-tax gains from a business divestiture and asset sales of $111 million, primarily in the first quarter. The increase in earnings in 2022 also reflected the impact of severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021, which reduced sales and produced incremental production and other operating costs in the first half of 2021. 36 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Consumer products The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). Consumer products group revenues increased approximately $524 million (13.7%) in the second quarter and $1.1 billion (15.4%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting higher revenues from Forest River and lower revenues from apparel and footwear businesses. Forest River’s revenues increased 34.1% in the second quarter and 37.0% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, driven by higher average selling prices and a 5.3% year-to-date increase in unit sales. Forest River experienced exceptional sales growth in recent years, however there are signs of slowing demand which could reverse that trend. Revenues of our apparel and footwear businesses declined $93 million (7.2%) in the second quarter and $137 million (5.4%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting lower revenues from apparel (15.5% in the second quarter and 10.1% in the first six months), partly offset by higher revenues from footwear. The declines in apparel revenues were driven by lower volumes, as retail customers reduced orders in response to rising inventories. Pre-tax earnings of our consumer products group declined $48 million (9.6%) in the second quarter and $108 million (10.6%) in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 3.1 percentage points in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The declines in earnings in 2022 reflected lower aggregate earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses, partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River. Forest River’s earnings increases were primarily due to the increases in sales, partly offset by higher materials costs. Apparel and footwear earnings declined about 50% in the second quarter and in the first half of 2022 compared to 2021. Our apparel businesses were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes, reduced manufacturing efficiencies and higher input costs, including raw material, freight, labor and other operating costs. While supply chain restrictions eased somewhat in the second quarter of 2022, we expect that the operating earnings of these businesses for the remainder of 2022 will be likely lower, due to slowing demand and high costs. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenues Service $ 4,737 $ 3,982 $ 9,260 $ 7,587 Retailing 4,880 4,995 9,472 9,348 McLane 13,262 12,295 25,777 23,917 $ 22,879 $ 21,272 $ 44,509 $ 40,852 Pre-tax earnings Service $ 756 $ 727 $ 1,480 $ 1,317 Retailing 443 459 854 807 McLane 76 84 158 187 $ 1,275 $ 1,270 $ 2,492 $ 2,311 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Service 16.0 % 18.3 % 16.0 % 17.4 % Retailing 9.1 % 9.2 % 9.0 % 8.6 % McLane 0.6 % 0.7 % 0.6 % 0.8 % Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). 37 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service (Continued) Service group revenues increased $755 million (19.0%) in the second quarter and $1.7 billion (22.1%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from TTI increased 16.3% in the second quarter and 22.3% in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021, reflecting strong demand in nearly all significant markets. During the second quarter, we saw signs that growth is beginning to decelerate, in part attributable to higher inventory levels within the supply chain. Revenues from aviation services (NetJets and FlightSafety) increased 22.6% in the second quarter and 23.0% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases reflected year-to-date increases in training hours (29%), customer flight hours (25%) and fuel surcharges to customers due to significant increases in fuel prices, partially offset by the effects from changes in sales mix. Pre-tax earnings of the service group increased $29 million (4.0%) in the second quarter and $163 million (12.4%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 1.4 percentage points in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. The increases in earnings reflected increases from TTI and CORT and decreases from aviation services. The increases in earnings from TTI were primarily attributable to the increases in sales and improved operating cost leverage. The decreases in earnings from aviation services were attributable to the need to utilize more subcontracted aircraft due to the exceptional increase in customer flight hours, and from higher equipment maintenance and other operating costs, which more than offset the increases in revenues. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), representing 65% of our combined retailing revenue in the first six months of 2022. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 20% of the combined retailing revenues in the first six months of 2022. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. Retailing group revenues decreased $115 million (2.3%) in the second quarter and increased $124 million (1.3%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. BHA’s revenues in the second quarter declined 1.0% and increased 3.8% in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. BHA’s revenues from new and used vehicle sales decreased 2.7% in the second quarter and increased 2.8% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from service and repair and finance and service contract revenues each increased versus 2021. Revenues from vehicle sales reflected higher average vehicle transaction prices, partly offset by lower unit sales. Unit sales continue to be constrained by low new vehicle production by original equipment manufacturers, attributable to the ongoing global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group revenues were relatively unchanged in the second quarter and in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, as higher average selling prices were substantially offset by lower transaction volumes. Retailing group pre-tax earnings decreased $16 million (3.5%) in the second quarter and increased $47 million (5.8%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 17.2% in the second quarter and 21.7% in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to increases in vehicle gross profit margins and finance and service contract earnings per vehicle sold and from operating cost control efforts. Over the remainder of 2022, BHA’s comparative new vehicle gross profit margin rates may decline compared to 2021, as the current environment of elevated margins began during the second half of 2021. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group decreased $52 million (20.8%) in the second quarter and $35 million (8.0%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to declining earnings from the furniture retailers and Pampered Chef. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised 61% of McLane’s consolidated sales in the first six months of 2022, with foodservice representing most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. 38 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) McLane Company (Continued) Revenues increased $967 million (7.9%) in the second quarter and $1.9 billion (7.8%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases in the first six months of 2022 of 3.4% from the grocery business and 16.5% from the foodservice business. Pre-tax earnings decreased $8 million (9.5%) in the second quarter and $29 million (15.5%) in the first six months of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to higher personnel costs, fuel expense and insurance costs, partly offset by increased gross sales margins. The increase in fuel expense was primarily attributable to significant increases in petroleum prices. McLane’s grocery and food service operating results continue to be adversely affected by supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages and higher inventory costs. We expect the current difficult operating environment to continue for the remainder of 2022. Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative contract gains/losses follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2022 2021 2022 2021 Investment gains (losses) $ (66,854 ) $ 27,173 $ (68,589 ) $ 32,384 Derivative contract gains (losses) (65 ) 221 (308 ) 710 Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests (66,919 ) 27,394 (68,897 ) 33,094 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (13,881 ) 5,986 (14,279 ) 6,993 Net earnings (loss) $ (53,038 ) $ 21,408 $ (54,618 ) $ 26,101 Effective income tax rate 21.0 % 21.4 % 20.8 % 20.9 % Investment gains/losses Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Unrealized gains and losses also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in non-U.S. issuers that are held by our U.S. based subsidiaries. Pre-tax investment gains/losses included net unrealized losses of $66.9 billion in the second quarter and $68.5 billion in the first six months of 2022 compared to net unrealized gains of $27.0 billion in the second quarter and $31.5 billion in the first six months of 2021 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Taxable investment gains/losses on equity securities sold is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost of the securities sold. Sales of equity securities produced taxable gains of $76 million in the second quarter and taxable losses of $663 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to taxable gains of $228 million in the second quarter and $2.0 billion in the first six months of 2021. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative contract gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our few remaining equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts originated between 2004 and 2008. The gains and losses from the changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant due to the volatility of market prices in the related equity securities markets. As of June 30, 2022, the intrinsic value of our remaining equity index put option contracts was $179 million and our recorded liability at fair value was $186 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under these contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined in the contracts. 39 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2022 2021 2022 2021 Equity method earnings $ 205 $ 141 $ 512 $ 355 Acquisition accounting expenses (162 ) (183 ) (323 ) (363 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (67 ) (77 ) (137 ) (157 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes 1,061 (45 ) 1,583 480 Other 80 (5 ) 159 (11 ) $ 1,117 $ (169 ) $ 1,794 $ 304 After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia, Electric Transmission of Texas and Iroquois Gas Transmission Systems. Equity method earnings increased $157 million in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021, primarily due to higher earnings from Kraft Heinz and Pilot. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC’s Euro and Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. In 2022, we recorded significant foreign currency exchange rate gains on these debt issues, due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, which reduced the U.S Dollar carrying value of the debt. These gains were largely offset by losses included in investment gains/losses, pertaining to non-U.S. Dollar denominated investments held by our U.S. based subsidiaries. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other earnings/loss consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes. Financial Condition Our Consolidated Balance Sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity attributable to Berkshire shareholders at June 30, 2022 was $461.2 billion, a decrease of $45.0 billion since December 31, 2021. Net loss attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $38.3 billion in the first six months of 2022, which included after-tax losses on our investments of $54.4 billion, substantially all of which occurred in the second quarter. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities will produce significant volatility in our earnings. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $4.2 billion in the first six months of 2022 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. At June 30, 2022, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $101.3 billion, which included $76.1 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $348.8 billion. During the first six months of 2022, we paid cash of $57.3 billion to acquire equities securities and we received proceeds of $12.0 billion from sales of equity securities. Our consolidated borrowings at June 30, 2022 were $119.1 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. In the first six months of 2022, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $10.2 billion in the aggregate. 40 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition (Continued) Berkshire parent company outstanding debt at June 30, 2022 was $20.1 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion since December 31, 2021. In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $600 million of maturing senior notes and issued ¥128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. Berkshire’s borrowings decreased $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2022 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on its non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Berkshire parent company debt maturities over the next twelve months approximate $4.3 billion, all of which is in the first six months of 2023. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $22.5 billion at June 30, 2022, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $17.9 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In March 2022, BHFC issued $4.5 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and issued €1.25 billion of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. Aggregate maturities of BHFC debt in the first six months of 2022 were $775 million. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.4 billion as of June 30, 2022, an increase of $157 million from December 31, 2021. In June 2022, BNSF issued $1.0 billion of 4.45% debentures due in 2053. During the first six months of 2022, BNSF repaid $800 million of term debt. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $53.1 billion at June 30, 2022, an increase of $1.3 billion from December 31, 2021. In April 2022, BHE issued $1.0 billion of 4.6% senior notes due in 2053, and during the first six months of 2022, subsidiaries issued approximately $1.3 billion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2052. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $2.6 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. In the first six months of 2022, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of approximately $15.4 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $6.8 billion in the first six months of 2022, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $4.8 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $6.6 billion for BHE and BNSF over the remainder of 2022. Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were $125.8 billion at June 30, 2022. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of June 30, 2022, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. On March 21, 2022, we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”) common stock for cash consideration of approximately $11.6 billion, subject to Alleghany shareholder approval and receipt of various regulatory approvals. We currently anticipate this acquisition will close in the fourth quarter of 2022. We also have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% of Pilot in 2023 and agreements to acquire certain non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, which are described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2022 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 41 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2022 includes estimated liabilities of $125.8 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2022 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.6 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.4 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2021. In connection with that annual goodwill impairment review, the estimated fair values of five reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $34.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $31.1 billion by 10.7%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the four other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $2.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.3 billion by 9.2%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.2 billion. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. As of June 30, 2022, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently anticipate, and we may need to record goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units and judgments on goodwill impairments at this time are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on a reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. 42 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements (Continued) Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; the adverse impacts from geopolitical events; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of June 30, 2022, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. 43 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use o f Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the second quarter of 2022 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program April Class A common stock — $ — — * Class B common stock — $ — — * May Class A common stock — $ — — * Class B common stock — $ — — * June Class A common stock 2,397 $ 425,870.54 2,397 * Class B common stock 25,462 $ 276.75 25,462 * * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $30 billion.

General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, changes in the fair values of certain derivative contract liabilities, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the magnitude of asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect most of our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 and likely will continue to be taken intended to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus. Actions in the latter part of 2021 and early 2022 included temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world in response to the emergence of variants of the virus. Notwithstanding these efforts, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs have persisted in 2022. Further, the development of geopolitical conflicts in 2022 have contributed to disruptions of supply chains, resulting in cost increases for commodities, goods, and services in many parts of the world. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2. New accounting pronouncements In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2018-12”). ASU 2018-12 requires reassessment of cash flow assumptions at least annually and revision of discount rate assumptions each reporting period in valuing policyholder liabilities and related deferred acquisition costs of long-duration contracts. The effects from changes in cash flow assumptions are reflected in earnings and the effects from changes in discount rate assumptions are reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the cash flow and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 is to be applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented in the financial statements, will require new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We currently intend to adopt ASU 2018-12 as of January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method, which provides that revised cash flow and discount rate assumptions as of January 1, 2021 (the transition date) be applied to contracts then in-force, with liabilities then remeasured as provided under the standard. The cumulative effects from discount rate assumption changes as of the transition date will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and the cumulative effect from cash flow assumption changes will be recorded in retained earnings. While we have not finalized our assessment of the impact of the adoption as of the transition date, we currently believe that the changes in discount rate assumptions will have a greater effect on our recorded liabilities than changes in cash flow assumptions. We also preliminarily estimate that the changes in discount rate assumptions as of the transition date will increase our life, health and annuity benefit liabilities from the amounts previously reported due to the historically low interest rate environment at that time. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2018-12 will be based on the discount rate and cash flow assumptions determined as of the January 1, 2023 adoption date. We, therefore, continue to evaluate the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 7 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.

The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 26.6 % of the outstanding shares of Kraft Heinz common stock. We recorded equity method earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz of $ 206 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $ 150 million in 2021. We received dividends on the common stock of $ 130 million in the first quarter of both 2022 and 2021, which were recorded as reductions to the carrying value of our investment. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $ 12.8 billion at March 31, 2022 and $ 11.7 billion at December 31, 2021. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $ 13.2 billion at March 31, 2022 and $ 13.1 billion at December 31, 2021. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investment exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by 3 % of the carrying value. We evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. Based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, we concluded recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required as of March 31, 2022. Summarized consolidated financial information of Kraft Heinz follows (in millions). March 26, 2022 December 25, 2021 Assets $ 93,864 $ 93,394 Liabilities 44,020 43,942 First Quarter 2022 2021 Sales $ 6,045 $ 6,394 Net earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz common shareholders 776 563 Other investments that we account for pursuant to the equity method include Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”), Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”) and Iroquois Gas Transmission System L.P. (“Iroquois”). The aggregate carrying value of these investments was approximately $ 4.4 billion as of March 31, 2022 and $ 4.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. We recorded equity method earnings in the first quarter of $ 170 million in 2022 and $ 101 million in 2021, and we received aggregate distributions in the first quarter of $ 28 million in 2022 and $ 896 million in 2021. Additional information concerning these investments follows. We own a 50 % interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50 % interest. Berkadia provides capital solutions, investment sales advisory and mortgage servicing for multifamily and commercial real estate. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through commercial paper, which was $ 1.47 billion at March 31, 2022 and is limited to $ 1.5 billion. Berkadia’s commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) subsidiaries own a 50 % noncontrolling interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in Texas and a 50 % noncontrolling interest in Iroquois, which owns and operates a natural gas pipeline located in New York and Connecticut. 9 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5. Equity method investments (Continued) We own a 38.6 % interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot operates travel centers in North America through more than 800 retail locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces and through wholesale distribution. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1 % interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining 11.3 % interest. We have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4 % interest in Pilot in 2023, with the Haslam family retaining a 20 % interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023. Note 6.

First Quarter 2022 2021 Investment gains (losses): Equity securities: Change in unrealized investment gains (losses) during the period on securities held at the end of the period $ ( 1,775 ) $ 4,630 Investment gains (losses) on securities sold during the period 89 430 ( 1,686 ) 5,060 Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains 6 20 Gross realized losses ( 49 ) ( 1 ) Other ( 6 ) 132 Investment gains (losses) ( 1,735 ) 5,211 Derivative contract gains (losses) ( 243 ) 489 $ ( 1,978 ) $ 5,700 Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the period. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $ 9.7 billion in the first three months of 2022 and $ 6.5 billion in the first three months of 2021. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the period represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable period or, if later, the purchase date. Our taxable gains/losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Taxable losses in the first quarter of 2022 were $ 739 million and taxable gains in 2021 were $ 1.8 billion. Our derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. As of March 31, 2022, we had six open contracts, which had an aggregate fair value liability of $ 121 million and an aggregate notional value of $ 2.6 billion. 10 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7.

Goodwill and other intangible assets (Continued) Intangible asset amortization expense in the first quarter was $ 303 million in 2022 and $ 319 million in 2021. Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $ 18.5 billion as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. Note 13. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 14), for each of the three-month periods ending March 31, 2022 and 2021 follows (in millions). 2022 2021 Balances at beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 86,664 $ 79,854 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 2,960 ) ( 2,912 ) Net liabilities 83,704 76,942 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year 13,375 11,363 Prior accident years ( 251 ) ( 646 ) Total 13,124 10,717 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year ( 3,908 ) ( 3,214 ) Prior accident years ( 8,091 ) ( 6,454 ) Total ( 11,999 ) ( 9,668 ) Foreign currency effect ( 106 ) ( 94 ) Balances at March 31: Net liabilities 84,723 77,897 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 2,944 3,064 Gross liabilities $ 87,667 $ 80,961 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 251 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $ 646 million in 2021, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 0.3 % in 2022 and 0.8 % in 2021. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years from primary insurance were reduced by $ 114 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $ 699 million in 2021. The reductions in 2022 derived primarily from private passenger automobile, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims, partly offset by increases in ultimate liabilities for other casualty claims. The decrease in incurred losses for prior accident years in 2021 was primarily due to reductions in private passenger automobile estimates, and to a lesser extent in medical professional liability and workers’ compensation estimates. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years related to property and casualty reinsurance decreased $ 137 million in the first quarter of 2022 and increased $ 53 million in 2021. 14 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charges for each of the three-month periods ending March 31, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions). 2022 2021 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges - retroactive reinsurance Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges - retroactive reinsurance Balances at beginning of year $ 38,256 $ ( 10,639 ) $ 40,966 $ ( 12,441 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current year contracts — — — — Prior years’ contracts ( 7 ) 215 ( 5 ) 252 Total ( 7 ) 215 ( 5 ) 252 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 547 ) — ( 276 ) — Balances at March 31 $ 37,702 $ ( 10,424 ) $ 40,685 $ ( 12,189 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 208 $ 247 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposure to losses began. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter for prior years’ contracts were $ 208 million in 2022 and $ 247 million in 2021 and included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments. Currently, our largest retroactive reinsurance contract is between our subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, and certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”). Our estimated claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $ 15.4 billion at March 31, 2022 and $ 15.8 billion at December 31, 2021. Deferred charges related to the AIG contract were $ 4.34 billion at March 31, 2022 and $ 4.45 billion at December 31, 2021. Note 15. Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of March 31, 2022. Weighted Average Interest Rate March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Insurance and other: Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $ 600 million of maturing senior notes and issued ¥ 128.5 billion (approximately $ 1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5 %. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In March 2022, BHFC issued $ 4.5 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4 % and € 1.25 billion (approximately $ 1.4 billion) of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8 %. The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 8.15 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 914 billion par at March 31, 2022) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $ 716 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $ 720 million in the first quarter of 2021. Berkshire also guarantees debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $ 3.8 billion at March 31, 2022. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. Weighted Average Interest Rate March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2023 - 2051 4.3 % $ 13,003 $ 13,003 Subsidiary and other debt due 2022 - 2064 4.1 % 36,901 36,759 Short-term borrowings 1.6 % 1,849 2,009 Burlington Northern Santa Fe (""BNSF"") and subsidiaries due 2022 - 2097 4.5 % 23,018 23,219 $ 74,771 $ 74,990 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In April 2022, BHE issued $ 1.0 billion of 4.6 % senior notes due in 2053 and a subsidiary issued £ 350 million of 3.25 % bonds due in 2052 . BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. As of March 31, 2022, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries have unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $ 10.4 billion at March 31, 2022, which included approximately $ 8.8 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 16 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16. Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, other receivables and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of their fair values.

Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions).

Fair Value Principal Valuation Techniques Unobservable Inputs Weighted Average Investments in equity securities: Preferred stock $ 10,497 Discounted cash flow Expected duration 7 years Discount for transferability restrictions and subordination 372 bps Common stock warrants 1,838 Warrant pricing model Expected duration 7 years Volatility 38% Investments in equity securities in the preceding table include our investments in certain preferred stocks and common stock warrants that do not have readily determinable market values as defined under GAAP. These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. 18 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 17. Common stock Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the first quarter of 2022 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Class A, $ 5 Par Value ( 1,650,000 shares authorized) Class B, $ 0.0033 Par Value ( 3,225,000,000 shares authorized) Issued Treasury Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding Balances at December 31, 2021 665,901 ( 48,788 ) 617,113 1,488,292,852 ( 197,818,349 ) 1,290,474,503 Conversions of Class A common stock to Class B common stock ( 1,148 ) — ( 1,148 ) 1,722,000 — 1,722,000 Treasury stock acquired — ( 2,005 ) ( 2,005 ) — ( 6,824,671 ) ( 6,824,671 ) Balances at March 31, 2022 664,753 ( 50,793 ) 613,960 1,490,014,852 ( 204,643,020 ) 1,285,371,832 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,470,875 shares outstanding as of March 31, 2022 and 1,477,429 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times the average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $ 30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note 18. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were 18.0 % in the first quarter 2022 and 18.5 % in the first quarter of 2021. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, the magnitude of gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. 19 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. On March 21, 2022 , Berkshire and Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”) entered into an agreement whereby Berkshire will acquire all of Alleghany’s outstanding common stock for cash of approximately $ 11.6 billion. The acquisition of Alleghany is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022 and is subject to approval by Alleghany shareholders and the receipt of various regulatory approvals. Alleghany owns property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses as well as a diverse portfolio of non-financial businesses. 20 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 22. Revenues from contracts with customers We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 (in millions). Other revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP, are primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines and marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. Revenues and earnings before income taxes by segment for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions). First Quarter 2022 2021 Insurance – underwriting $ 47 $ 764 Insurance – investment income 1,170 1,208 Railroad 1,371 1,251 Utilities and energy 750 703 Manufacturing, service and retailing 3,025 2,619 Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) (1,580 ) 4,693 Other 677 473 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 5,460 $ 11,711 Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect most of our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 and likely will continue to be taken to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus. Actions in the latter part of 2021 and early 2022 included periodic temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world in response to the emergence of variants of the virus. Notwithstanding these efforts, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs have persisted. Further, the development of geopolitical conflicts in 2022 have contributed to the disruptions of supply chains, resulting in cost increases for goods and services in many parts of the world. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of these events on our businesses or when our operations will normalize. Nor can we reliably predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Insurance underwriting produced after-tax earnings of $47 million in the first quarter of 2022 versus $764 million in 2021. Underwriting earnings in the first quarter of 2022 were negatively impacted by ongoing increases in claims severities at GEICO. Underwriting earnings in 2021 reflected the effects of the premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program and the favorable impact of lower claims frequencies for private passenger automobile coverages, which were partially offset by higher claims severities. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income decreased 3.1% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to lower dividend income. After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 9.6% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase reflected higher revenue per car/unit, partly offset by lower overall freight volumes and higher average fuel costs. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 6.7% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase reflected higher earnings from the regulated utilities businesses, including increased production tax credits for renewable energy, and from higher earnings from tax equity investments, partly offset by lower earnings from the natural gas pipelines and real estate brokerage businesses. After-tax earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 15.5% in the first quarter of 2022 versus 2021. While customer demand for products and services was relatively good in the first quarter of 2022, we continue to experience the effects of higher materials, freight, labor and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. Investment and derivative contract gains and losses in 2022 and 2021 predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and includes unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 23 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett, and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the quarterly or annual operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding $100 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in the first quarters included floods in Australia in 2022 and Winter Storm Uri in 2021. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $125 billion as of March 31, 2022. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Underwriting results of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses have been affected by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including incremental provisions for claims. The effects of the pandemic on future periods may be affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims and by its effects on general economic activity, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2022 2021 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss): GEICO $ (178 ) $ 1,023 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 92 206 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 156 (263 ) Pre-tax underwriting earnings 70 966 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 23 202 Net underwriting earnings $ 47 $ 764 Effective income tax rate 34.4 % 20.9 % GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2022 2021 Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 10,265 $ 10,006 Premiums earned $ 9,554 100.0 $ 8,923 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 8,544 89.4 6,463 72.4 Underwriting expenses 1,188 12.5 1,437 16.1 Total losses and expenses 9,732 101.9 7,900 88.5 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ (178 ) $ 1,023 24 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting loss in the first quarter of 2022 reflected increased claims severity, primarily due to significant cost inflation in automobile markets, which accelerated in the second half of 2021. Increases in used car prices are producing increased claims severities on total losses and shortages of car parts are contributing to increased claims severity on partial losses. In addition, injury claims severities continue to trend higher than general inflation rates. Premiums written in the first quarter of 2022 increased $259 million (2.6%) compared to 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average premiums per auto policy due to rate increases, as average policies in-force were relatively unchanged. Premiums earned in the first quarter of 2022 increased $631 million (7.1%) compared to 2021. Premiums earned in 2021 included a reduction of approximately $400 million attributable to the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback program that provided a 15% premium credit to new and renewing voluntary auto and motorcycle policies written between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter of 2022 increased $2.1 billion (32.2%) compared to 2021. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned in the first quarter of 2022 was 89.4%, an increase of 17.0 percentage points compared to 2021, which reflected increases in claims frequencies and severities. Claims frequencies in the first quarter of 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (ten to eleven percent range), collision (fifteen to sixteen percent range), bodily injury (twelve to thirteen percent range) and personal injury (fourteen to fifteen percent range). Average claims severities in the first quarter of 2022 were higher for property damage coverage (six to seven percent range), collision coverage (twenty to twenty-two percent range) and bodily injury coverage (nine to eleven percent range). GEICO’s losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter included reductions in the ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events of $92 million in 2022 and $521 million in 2021. The reduction in estimates for prior years’ events in 2022 reflected decreases for bodily and personal injury coverages and increases for collision and property damage coverages. Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2022 were $1.2 billion, a decrease of $249 million (17.3%) compared to 2021, reflecting lower employee-related and advertising expenses. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) in the first quarter of 2022 was 12.5% compared to 16.1% in 2021, attributable to both the decrease in expenses as well as the increase in earned premiums. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary’s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”). A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2022 2021 Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 3,392 $ 2,908 Premiums earned $ 3,118 100.0 $ 2,654 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 2,274 72.9 1,849 69.7 Underwriting expenses 752 24.1 599 22.5 Total losses and expenses 3,026 97.0 2,448 92.2 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 92 $ 206 Premiums written increased $484 million (16.6%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases at nearly all of our larger insurance units, including BH Specialty (28%), BHHC (12%) and USLI (17%). The increases were across multiple coverages and occurred in several markets. 25 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) BH Primary’s loss ratio was 72.9% in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 3.2 percentage points compared to 2021. Losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to significant catastrophe events were $75 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $150 million in 2021. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were reduced $22 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $178 million in 2021 for net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events. BH Primary insurers also write significant levels of workers’ compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. We could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2022 increased $153 million (25.5%) compared to 2021. Our expense ratio also increased 1.6 percentage points compared to 2021. These increases reflected costs associated with new business development and changes in business mix. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the claim liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Property/casualty $ 3,399 $ 3,394 $ 405 $ 166 Life/health 1,248 1,305 (12 ) (172 ) Retroactive reinsurance — — (190 ) (242 ) Periodic payment annuity 169 144 (103 ) (136 ) Variable annuity 4 4 56 121 $ 4,820 $ 4,847 $ 156 $ (263 ) Property/casualty A summary of property/casualty reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) Premiums written in the first quarter of 2022 were relatively unchanged from 2021, reflecting a modest net increase from volumes and rates, offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $100 million (4.2%) and the loss ratio declined 3.0 percentage points in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Losses incurred arising from significant catastrophe events in the first quarter of 2022 were $315 million, which were partially offset by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $137 million. Losses incurred in the first quarter of 2021 included $310 million from significant catastrophe events and an increase in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $53 million. Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. The expense ratio decreased 4.0 percentage points in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to changes in business mix and foreign currency effects. Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2022 2021 Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 1,243 $ 1,301 Premiums earned $ 1,248 100.0 $ 1,305 100.0 Life and health insurance benefits 1,051 84.2 1,251 95.9 Underwriting expenses 209 16.8 226 17.3 Total benefits and expenses 1,260 101.0 1,477 113.2 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ (12 ) $ (172 ) Life/health premiums written decreased $58 million (4.5%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower volumes in the Asia Pacific and North America regions and from unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Life and health benefits in the first quarter of 2022 declined $200 million (16.0%) compared to 2021, attributable to lower mortality. Underwriting results in 2021 were affected by significant, pandemic-related increases in mortality in the U.S., South Africa and Latin America, which were partially offset by lower underwriting expenses, due mainly to lower average commission rates in the international life business. Retroactive reinsurance Pre-tax underwriting losses in each period derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 were insignificant. Pre-tax underwriting losses in the first quarter before foreign currency exchange effects were $195 million in 2022 and $243 million in 2021. Unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $37.7 billion at March 31, 2022, declining $554 million since December 31, 2021, primarily due to loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $10.4 billion at March 31, 2022, a decline of $215 million since December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to periodic amortization. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned increased $25 million (17.4%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. 27 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Periodic payment annuity (Continued) Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and interest rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results in the first quarter included foreign currency gains of $44 million in 2022 and losses of $10 million in 2021. Excluding foreign currency exchange gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses in the first quarter were $147 million in 2022 compared to $126 million in 2021. The increase in pre-tax losses reflected the effects of new business and lower mortality. Discounted annuity liabilities were $15.3 billion at March 31, 2022 and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of $56 million in 2022 and $121 million in 2021. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting earnings in each period were primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate changes and in 2022 were partly offset by unfavorable changes in securities markets.

While exceptionally low interest rates prevailed in recent years, rates began to increase in the first quarter of 2022. The effects of such increases are expected to be reflected in our earnings as maturing investments are replaced by new investments. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Dividend income in the first quarter of 2022 decreased 4.5% compared to 2021. Dividend income may vary from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Dividend income in the first quarter included $16 million in 2022 and $38 million in 2021 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $148 billion at March 31, 2022 and $147 billion at December 31, 2021. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, and consequently, the average cost of float for each period was negative. 28 Item 2.

Railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with over 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped including consumer products, industrial products, agricultural products and coal. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2022 2021 Railroad operating revenues $ 5,777 $ 5,221 Railroad operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 1,224 1,164 Fuel 861 550 Purchased services 499 505 Depreciation and amortization 624 616 Equipment rents, materials and other 526 491 Total 3,734 3,326 Railroad operating earnings 2,043 1,895 Other revenues (expenses): Other revenues 191 180 Other expenses, net (170 ) (158 ) Interest expense (255 ) (258 ) Pre-tax earnings 1,809 1,659 Income taxes 438 408 Net earnings $ 1,371 $ 1,251 Effective income tax rate 24.2 % 24.6 % 29 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad (Continued) The following table summarizes BNSF’s railroad freight volumes by business group (cars/units in thousands). Cars/Units First Quarter Percentage 2022 2021 Change Consumer products 1,275 1,393 (8.5 )% Industrial products 404 399 1.3 Agricultural products 305 318 (4.1 ) Coal 385 339 13.6 2,369 2,449 (3.3 ) Railroad operating revenues increased 10.6% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a 13.8% increase in average revenue per car/unit resulting from higher fuel surcharge revenue driven by higher fuel prices, along with increased rates per car/unit, partially offset by a 3.3% decrease in unit volume. Pre-tax earnings were $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 9.0% compared to 2021. Operating revenues from consumer products were $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 10.3% from 2021. The increase reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by lower volumes of 8.5%. The volume decrease was mainly from lower international intermodal shipments resulting from supply chain challenges and lower automotive shipments due to production impacts from a global microchip shortage, partially offset by an increase in domestic intermodal volumes. Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 5.8% from 2021. Volumes increased 1.3% in the first quarter along with higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to improvement in the U.S. industrial economy. Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 3.7% compared to 2021, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by decreased volumes of 4.1%. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of ethanol and related commodities. Operating revenues from coal were $889 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 29.6% from 2021, attributable to higher volumes of 13.6%, as well as from higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase in 2022 derived from increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand. Railroad operating expenses were $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $408 million (12.3%) compared to 2021, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits and fuel expenses. Our ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues in the first quarter of 2022 increased 0.9 percentage points to 64.6% versus 2021. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $60 million (5.2%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to wage inflation, health and welfare costs and lower productivity. Fuel expenses increased $311 million (56.5%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher average fuel prices. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $35 million (7.1%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to increased general inflation and higher casualty costs. 30 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy We currently own 91.1% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. BHE subsidiaries also operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid in Great Britain. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“LNG interest”), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments. BHE also operates a residential real estate brokerage business and a large network of residential real estate brokerage franchises in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are largely based on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2022 2021 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 4,823 $ 4,849 Real estate operating revenue 1,207 1,232 Other income (loss) (47 ) (157 ) Total revenue 5,983 5,924 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 1,460 1,569 Energy operating expense 2,153 2,036 Real estate operating costs and expense 1,179 1,120 Interest expense 515 516 Total costs and expense 5,307 5,241 Pre-tax earnings 676 683 Income tax expense (benefit)* (283 ) (232 ) Net earnings after income taxes 959 915 Noncontrolling interests of BHE subsidiaries 109 106 Net earnings attributable to BHE 850 809 Noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends 100 106 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 750 $ 703 Effective income tax rate (41.9 )% (34.0 )% * Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (Continued) PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. After-tax earnings decreased $39 million in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease reflected higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales). The increase in operating expenses reflected incremental costs from additional assets placed in-service as well as higher thermal plant maintenance costs. PacifiCorp’s utility margin was $832 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $14 million from 2021. The increase reflected higher retail revenue from increases in customer volumes and favorable price impacts, and higher wholesale and other revenue, partially offset by higher purchased power and thermal generation costs. Retail customer volumes increased 1.9% in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, the favorable impact of weather and higher customer usage. MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased $97 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and increased income tax benefits, partly offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses included incremental costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. The income tax benefit increase was mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service and the impacts of ratemaking. MEC’s electric utility margin was $483 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 23% versus 2021. The increase was attributable to higher operating revenue from favorable retail and wholesale customer volumes and lower purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes increased 5.6% in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, higher customer usage and the favorable impact of weather. NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings decreased $5 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease reflected higher operating expenses from increased plant operations and maintenance expenses and a higher comparative accrual for earnings sharing. NV Energy’s electric utility margin was $306 million in the first quarter of 2022, relatively unchanged compared to 2021. Electric retail customer volumes increased 4.0% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers and higher customer usage, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather. Northern Powergrid’s after-tax earnings increased $7 million in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflected the impacts of higher distribution revenue, mainly from increased tariff rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2022. Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings decreased $74 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was largely due to higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue in the first quarter of 2021 due to an increase in demand as a result of the February 2021 winter storms. Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings increased $111 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in earnings was primarily due to improved wind tax equity investment earnings of $118 million. The increase in wind tax equity investment earnings was primarily due to losses on pre-existing tax equity investments in the first quarter of 2021 due to the February 2021 winter storms, as well as from increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings decreased $63 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to lower earnings from mortgage services due to a decrease in funded volume and in refinancing activity, and to a lesser extent lower earnings from brokerage and settlement services from a decrease in closed units at existing companies. 32 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter Percentage 2022 2021 Change Revenues Manufacturing $ 18,421 $ 15,913 15.8 % Service and retailing 21,630 19,580 10.5 $ 40,051 $ 35,493 Pre-tax earnings Manufacturing $ 2,824 $ 2,436 15.9 % Service and retailing 1,217 1,041 16.9 4,041 3,477 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,016 858 Net earnings* $ 3,025 $ 2,619 Effective income tax rate 24.6 % 24.2 % Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues 10.1 % 9.8 % * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which primarily related to the amortization of identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings were $161 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $180 million in the first quarter of 2021. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page 23 and in the “Other” earnings section on page 38. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of these operations follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2022 2021 Revenues Industrial products $ 7,475 $ 6,672 Building products 6,712 5,628 Consumer products 4,234 3,613 $ 18,421 $ 15,913 Pre-tax earnings Industrial products $ 1,216 $ 1,142 Building products 1,144 770 Consumer products 464 524 $ 2,824 $ 2,436 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Industrial products 16.3 % 17.1 % Building products 17.0 % 13.7 % Consumer products 11.0 % 14.5 % Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)) and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). 33 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Revenues of the industrial products group in the first quarter of 2022 increased $803 million (12.0%) compared to 2021 while pre-tax earnings increased $74 million (6.5%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 16.3% for the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points compared to 2021. PCC’s revenues were $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 12.7% over the first quarter of 2021. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from sales of aerospace products. The revenue increase in 2022 reflected higher aerospace product revenues and relatively unchanged revenues from power and other industrial products. While commercial air travel continues to increase in both the U.S. and international markets, traffic remains below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel. However, further recovery likely will continue to be uneven, attributable in part to travel restrictions imposed from time-to-time to control the spread of variants of the virus. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by original equipment manufacturers appear to be increasing, most notably for narrow-body aircraft, although Boeing’s growth is constrained by the lack of certification of the Boeing 737 MAX in China. In addition, the pause in deliveries of the Boeing 787 due to production quality issues further impacts aerospace growth. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased $16 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting the impact of increased revenues, partially offset by a $13 million reduction in pension plan income. The improvement in operating results also reflects the continual actions taken by management to improve operations and to prepare for more normalized demand for PCC’s products. We do not currently expect PCC’s aerospace revenues or earnings will increase significantly in the near term, primarily due to the expected lag in recovery of PCC’s manufacturing levels as a result of inventory levels within the supply chain for Boeing, and the potential for delays with the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX in China and the resumption of Boeing 787 production. Lubrizol’s revenues were approximately $1.65 billion in the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of 2.5% compared to 2021. The decrease reflects lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher average selling prices. Sales volumes in the first quarter of 2022 were restricted by raw material supply constraints and unplanned temporary maintenance shutdowns, which limited Lubrizol’s production capabilities. The increase in average selling prices was due to escalating prices for raw materials, including oil feedstocks, as well as for utilities, packaging, shipping and freight costs. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings decreased 39.8% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 were negatively impacted by rising raw material costs and lower sales volumes and higher expenses arising from the unplanned temporary shutdowns. Earnings in the first quarter of 2021 were negatively impacted by the weather-related temporary shutdown of Additives facilities in the U.S., which resulted in various incremental and non-recurring operating costs and lost sales margins. Marmon’s revenues were $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 26.2% compared to 2021, with nearly all business groups generating meaningful revenue increases. In particular, aggregate revenues in the first quarter of 2022 from the Electrical, Metal Services and Transportation groups increased 39% compared to 2021, attributable to higher average metals prices and sales volumes. These groups contributed over half of Marmon’s revenue increase. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased 43.8% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting higher earnings from most business groups, partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Medical groups. The Electrical, Transportation and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups generated the largest increases in earnings in the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher sales volumes and improved operating margins. IMC’s revenues were $960 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 8.5% compared to 2021. Revenues in the first quarter of 2022 reflected increased sales in most geographic regions, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 8.3% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021, attributable to higher customer demand, partially offset by higher raw material costs and other operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). 34 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) Revenues of the building products group increased $1.1 billion (19.3%) in the first quarter of 2022 and pre-tax earnings increased $374 million (48.6%) compared to 2021. Residential housing construction demand in the U.S. continued to be relatively strong in the first quarter of 2022. We continue to be negatively affected by persistent supply chain disruptions, which limited our sales and contributed to production delays in some areas and contributed to significant cost increases for many raw materials and other inputs, including energy, freight and labor. These effects necessitated sales price increases. In the first quarter of 2022, interest rates in the U.S. increased significantly compared to the previous low-rate environment. Significant increases in mortgage interest rates will likely slow demand for new housing construction, which could adversely impact our businesses. Clayton Homes’ revenues increased 21.3% to approximately $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from home sales increased $470 million (26.6%), primarily due to higher average selling prices and changes in sales mix. New home unit sales increased 4.3% in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting higher factory-built manufactured home unit and essentially unchanged site-built home unit sales. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 3.8% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $19.4 billion as of March 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $600 million from December 31, 2021. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes increased $94 million (24.0%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 reflected higher home sales, gross margins and net interest income and relatively low credit losses, partially offset by the impact of rising manufacturing and supply chain costs. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $3.9 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $592 million (17.8%) versus 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by higher input and transportation costs, and to a lesser extent, from higher unit volumes and product mix changes for paint and coatings and commercial flooring, and strength in residential and retail insulation, commercial roofing systems and engineered products. These volume increases were partially offset by lower residential flooring products volumes. Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses increased $280 million (73.9%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. Earnings as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of 2022 increased 5.4 percentage points versus 2021. Earnings in 2022 benefitted from a pre-tax gain of $94 million from a business divestiture. The increase in earnings in 2022 also reflected the impact of severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021, which reduced sales and produced incremental production and other operating costs. Customer demand was generally strong in 2022. However, earnings were negatively impacted from the lack of availability of certain materials and other product inputs from supply chain disruptions. Consumer products The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). Consumer products revenues increased approximately $621 million (17.2%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from Forest River increased 40.1% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, driven by higher average selling prices and a 6.5% increase in unit sales. Revenues of our other consumer products businesses in 2022 were generally lower than the first quarter of 2021, including a 3.5% decrease from apparel and footwear, as well as lower revenues from Duracell. These decreases reflected lower sales volumes, partly attributable to reduced inventory availability arising from production slowdowns in Asia, inbound freight delays and shortages of certain raw materials, partly offset by higher average selling prices. Pre-tax earnings of our consumer products group declined $60 million (11.5%) in the first quarter of 2022 versus 2021 and pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 3.5 percentage points in 2022 compared to 2021. The decline in earnings reflected lower earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses and Duracell, partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River. Aggregate earnings from Duracell and the apparel and footwear businesses declined about 50% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. These declines were attributable to significant increases in raw material, freight, labor and other operating costs and the impact of reduced sales volumes. 35 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2022 2021 Revenues Service $ 4,523 $ 3,605 Retailing 4,592 4,353 McLane 12,515 11,622 $ 21,630 $ 19,580 Pre-tax earnings Service $ 724 $ 590 Retailing 411 348 McLane 82 103 $ 1,217 $ 1,041 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Service 16.0 % 16.4 % Retailing 9.0 % 8.0 % McLane 0.7 % 0.9 % Service Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Service group revenues increased $918 million (25.5%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from TTI increased 28.9% in the first quarter of 2022 versus the first quarter of 2021, reflecting strong demand in nearly all significant markets. Revenues from aviation services (NetJets and FlightSafety) increased 23.5% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increased training hours (38%), customer flight hours (36%) and fuel surcharges due to significant increases in fuel prices, partially offset by the effects from changes in sales mix. Pre-tax earnings of the service group increased $134 million (22.7%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 0.4 percentage points in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The earnings increase reflected increases from TTI, partially offset by lower earnings from aviation services. The earnings increase from TTI was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and improved operating cost leverage. The earnings decrease from aviation services was attributable to higher subcontracted flight, equipment maintenance and other operating costs, which more than offset the increase in revenues. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), representing 65% of our combined retailing revenue in the first quarter of 2022. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 20% of the combined retailing revenues in the first quarter of 2022. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. 36 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) Retailing group revenues increased approximately $239 million (5.5%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. BHA’s revenues in the first quarter of 2022 increased 9.5% over the first quarter of 2021, with vehicle sales, service and repair, and finance and service contract revenues each increasing versus 2021. The increase in vehicle sales was primarily attributable to higher average vehicle transaction prices, partly offset by lower unit sales. Unit sales continue to be constrained by low new vehicle production by original equipment manufacturers, attributable to the ongoing global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group revenues increased 1.6% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to higher average selling prices and lower transaction volumes. Retailing group pre-tax earnings increased $63 million (18.1%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 27.4% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to increases in vehicle sales margins and finance and service contract earnings per vehicle sold, lower floorplan interest expense and from operating cost control efforts. Pre-tax earnings from BHA’s dealership operations increased 41.5% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $18 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher earnings from the jewelry retailers, partly offset by lower earnings from the furniture retailers and Pampered Chef. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised 62% of McLane’s consolidated sales in the first quarter of 2022, with foodservice representing most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues increased $893 million (7.7%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases of 3.6% from the grocery business and 15.9% from the foodservice business. Pre-tax earnings decreased $21 million (20.4%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, which was primarily attributable to higher personnel costs and fuel expense, partly offset by a slight increase in the average gross sales margin rate. McLane’s grocery and food service operating results continue to be adversely affected by upstream supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, higher inventory costs and disruptions in inventory availability. These upstream supply chain effects, together with the personnel shortages that we have been experiencing, adversely affected our customer service levels and reduced our operating efficiencies. The increase in fuel expense was primarily attributable to significant increases in petroleum prices. We expect the current difficult operating environment to continue through 2022. Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative contract gains/losses follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2022 2021 Investment gains (losses) $ (1,735 ) $ 5,211 Derivative contract gains (losses) (243 ) 489 Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests (1,978 ) 5,700 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (398 ) 1,007 Net earnings (loss) $ (1,580 ) $ 4,693 Effective income tax rate 16.0 % 18.8 % Investment gains/losses Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains/losses in the first quarter included net unrealized losses of $1.8 billion in 2022 and net unrealized gains of $4.6 billion in 2021 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Taxable investment gains/losses on equity securities sold in the first quarter, which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were losses of $739 million in 2022 and gains of $1.8 billion in 2021. 37 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses (Continued) Investment gains/losses (Continued) We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative contract gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated before March of 2008. As of March 31, 2022, the vast majority of these contracts have expired. The gains and losses from the changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant due to the volatility of market prices in the related equity securities markets. As of March 31, 2022, the intrinsic value of our remaining equity index put option contracts was $84 million and our recorded liability at fair value was $121 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under these contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined in the contracts. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). First Quarter 2022 2021 Equity method earnings $ 307 $ 214 Acquisition accounting expenses (161 ) (180 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (70 ) (80 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes 522 525 Other Berkshire corporate 79 (6 ) $ 677 $ 473 After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia, Electric Transmission of Texas and Iroquois Gas Transmission Systems. Earnings in the first quarter of 2022 increased $93 million versus 2021, primarily due to higher earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz and Pilot. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC’s Euro and Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Berkshire corporate items consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity attributable to Berkshire shareholders at March 31, 2022 was $508.1 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion since December 31, 2021. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $5.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022, which included after-tax losses on our investments of $1.4 billion. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities will produce significant volatility in our earnings. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. 38 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition (Continued) At March 31, 2022, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $102.7 billion, which included $74.1 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $412.3 billion. During the first quarter of 2022, we paid cash of $51.1 billion to acquire equities securities and we received proceeds of $9.7 billion from sales of equity securities. Our consolidated borrowings at March 31, 2022 were $119.7 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. In the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $7.4 billion in the aggregate. Berkshire parent company outstanding debt outstanding at March 31, 2022 was $21.3 billion, a decrease of $122 million since December 31, 2021. In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $600 million of maturing senior notes and issued ¥128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. Berkshire’s borrowings decreased $650 million in the first quarter of 2022 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on its non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Aggregate maturities of Berkshire parent company debt over the next twelve months approximates $3.9 billion, all of which is in the first quarter of 2023. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $23.6 billion at March 31, 2022, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $18.9 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In March 2022, BHFC issued $4.5 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and issued €1.25 billion of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. Aggregate maturities of BHFC debt in the second quarter of 2022 are $775 million. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.0 billion as of March 31, 2022, a decrease of $201 million from December 31, 2021. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $51.8 billion at March 31, 2022, substantially unchanged from December 31, 2021. In April 2022, BHE issued $1.0 billion of 4.6% senior notes due in 2053 and a subsidiary issued £350 million of 3.25% notes due in 2052. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $2.6 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. In the first quarter of 2022, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of approximately $6.8 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $3.1 billion in the first quarter of 2022, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $2.2 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $9.4 billion over the remainder of 2022. Contractual Obligations We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $125 billion at March 31, 2022. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of March 31, 2022, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. 39 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations (Continued) On March 21, 2022, we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”) common stock for cash consideration of approximately $11.6 billion, subject to Alleghany shareholder approval and receipt of various regulatory approvals. We currently anticipate this acquisition will close in the fourth quarter of 2022. We also have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% of Pilot in 2023 and agreements to acquire certain non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, which are described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2022 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2022 includes estimated liabilities of $125.4 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2022 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.8 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.5 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2021. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2021, the estimated fair values of five reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $34.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $31.1 billion by 10.7%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the four other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $2.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.3 billion by 9.2%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.2 billion. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. As of March 31, 2022, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently anticipate, and we may need to record goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units and judgments on goodwill impairments at this time are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on a reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 40 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; the adverse impacts from geopolitical events; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of March 31, 2022, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. 41 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use o f Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the first quarter of 2022 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program January Class A common stock 625 $ 455,959.81 625 * Class B common stock 73,987 $ 299.82 73,987 * February Class A common stock 1,048 $ 474,398.80 1,048 * Class B common stock 3,168,329 $ 312.14 3,168,329 * March Class A common stock 332 $ 485,015.95 332 * Class B common stock 3,582,355 $ 322.88 3,582,355 * * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $30 billion.

30, 2021 Note 1. General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, changes in the fair values of certain derivative contract liabilities, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the magnitude of asset impairment charges can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread rapidly across the world in 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in March of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected nearly all of our operations during 2020 and in particular during the second quarter, although the effects varied significantly. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, many of our businesses experienced significantly higher sales and earnings relative to the second quarter, reflecting higher customer demand. The extent of the effects over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Risks and uncertainties resulting from the pandemic that may affect our future earnings, cash flows and financial condition include the ability to vaccinate a significant number of people in the U.S. and throughout the world, as well as the long-term effect from the pandemic on the demand for certain of our products and services. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2. New accounting pronouncements We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January 1, 2020 . ASC 326 provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried at amortized cost based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a charge to retained earnings of $ 388 million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses, which was primarily related to our manufactured housing loans. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts.” ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used to value policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts, with the effects of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount rate assumptions reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are established at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 8 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.

Investments in equity securities (Continued) Our equity security investments also include Occidental Corporation (“Occidental”) Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $ 10 billion and warrants to purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $ 59.62 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8 % per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, or is mandatorily redeemable under specified events.

The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 325,442,152 shares of Kraft Heinz common stock representing 26.5 % of the outstanding shares. Our investment in Kraft Heinz produced equity method earnings of $ 194 million in the third quarter and $ 337 million in the first nine months of 2021. In 2020, our Kraft Heinz investment generated equity method earnings of $ 159 million in the third quarter and losses of $ 180 million in the first nine months. Our earnings in the first nine months of 2020 included charges of approximately $ 850 million for our proportionate share of the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. We received dividends on the common stock of $ 391 million in each of the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, which were recorded as reductions to the carrying value of our investment. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $ 12.0 billion at September 30, 2021 and $ 11.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $ 13.3 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. As of September 30, 2021, the carrying value of our investment exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by approximately 10 %. We evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. Based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, we concluded recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required as of September 30, 2021. Summarized consolidated financial information of Kraft Heinz follows (in millions).

Other investments that we account for pursuant to the equity method include Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”) and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”). The aggregate carrying value of these investments was approximately $ 3.4 billion as of September 30, 2021 and $ 4.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. Our equity method earnings from these entities in the first nine months were $ 438 million in 2021 and $ 513 million in 2020. During the first nine months of 2021, we received distributions of $ 1.0 billion from these other investees, including a non-recurring distribution received from Pilot of $ 849 million in the first quarter.

Investment and derivative contract gains/losses Investment and derivative contract gains/losses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 and 2020 are summarized as follows (in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2021 2020 2021 2020 Investment gains (losses): Equity securities: Change in unrealized investment gains (losses) during the period on securities held at the end of the period $ 4,759 $ 30,837 $ 36,163 $ 16,458 Investment gains (losses) on securities sold during the period 75 1,330 889 ( 13,901 ) 4,834 32,167 37,052 2,557 Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains 24 12 59 53 Gross realized losses ( 7 ) ( 2 ) ( 20 ) ( 22 ) Other — ( 552 ) 144 ( 556 ) Investment gains (losses) 4,851 31,625 37,235 2,032 Derivative contract gains (losses) 70 ( 43 ) 780 ( 640 ) $ 4,921 $ 31,582 $ 38,015 $ 1,392 Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the period. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $ 12.0 billion in the first nine months of 2021 and $ 28.6 billion in the first nine months of 2020. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the period represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable period or, if later, the purchase date. Our taxable gains/losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Taxable gains in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 were $ 941 million and $ 2.9 billion, respectively, and were $ 3.9 billion and $ 666 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively. The derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. Information related to these contracts follows (dollars in millions). September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Balance sheet liabilities - at fair value $ 286 $ 1,065 Notional value 8,251 10,991 Intrinsic value 83 727 Weighted average remaining life (in years) 0.6 1.2 Notional value in the preceding table represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming the value of each index is zero at each contract’s expiration date. Intrinsic value is the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Substantially all open contracts as of September 30, 2021 will expire by February 2023 . Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the index value is below the contract strike price at the contract expiration date. We received aggregate premiums on the contract inception dates of $ 1.5 billion with respect to unexpired contracts as of September 30, 2021 and we have no counterparty credit risk. 11 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7.

Goodwill and other intangible assets (Continued) Intangible asset amortization expense in the first nine months was $ 942 million in 2021 and $ 962 million in 2020. Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $ 18.3 billion as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. During 2020, we concluded it was necessary to reevaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of certain of our reporting units for impairment due to the disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of approximately $ 10 billion and pre-tax indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $ 638 million in the second quarter of 2020. Approximately $ 10 billion of these charges related to Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), the largest business within Berkshire's manufacturing segment. The carrying value of PCC-related goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets prior to the impairment charges was approximately $ 31 billion. Note 13. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 14), for each of the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2021 and 2020 follows (in millions). 2021 2020 Balances at beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 79,854 $ 73,019 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 2,912 ) ( 2,855 ) Net liabilities 76,942 70,164 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events 38,447 31,777 Prior accident years’ events ( 2,151 ) 69 Total 36,296 31,846 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events ( 15,277 ) ( 11,691 ) Prior accident years’ events ( 15,076 ) ( 15,259 ) Total ( 30,353 ) ( 26,950 ) Foreign currency translation adjustment ( 119 ) 124 Balances at September 30: Net liabilities 82,766 75,184 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 2,988 2,857 Gross liabilities $ 85,754 $ 78,041 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Current accident year incurred losses in 2021 included approximately $ 2.7 billion from significant catastrophe events (losses in excess of $ 100 million per event) in the U.S. and Europe, including approximately $ 2.2 billion in the third quarter, primarily from Hurricane Ida and floods in Europe. We recorded a net reduction of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 2.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021 compared to a net increase of $ 69 million in 2020, which produced a corresponding decrease in 2021 and an increase in 2020 in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. These amounts represented 2.8 % in 2021 and 0.1 % in 2020 of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events with respect to primary insurance were reduced $ 1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2021 compared to $ 273 million in 2020. The reduction in 2021 derived primarily from private passenger automobile claims, and to a lesser extent medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to reinsurance assumed in the first nine months decreased $ 564 million in 2021 and increased $ 342 million in 2020, which included increased provisions for legacy casualty exposures. 15 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charges reinsurance assumed for each of the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2021 and 2020 follow (in millions). 2021 2020 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Balances at beginning of year $ 40,966 $ ( 12,441 ) $ 42,441 $ ( 13,747 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current year contracts 82 — — — Prior years’ contracts ( 9 ) 709 131 735 Total 73 709 131 735 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 1,318 ) — ( 786 ) — Balances at September 30 $ 39,721 $ ( 11,732 ) $ 41,786 $ ( 13,012 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 782 $ 866 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposure to losses begins. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for prior years’ contracts were $ 700 million in 2021 and $ 866 million in 2020, which consisted of recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effects of changes in the expected timing and amount of future loss payments. Berkshire’s subsidiary, National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), is party to a contract with certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”), in which NICO’s ultimate liability is contractually limited to $ 20 billion. Claim payments to AIG commenced in 2021. Our estimated unpaid claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $ 16.8 billion at September 30, 2021, reflecting paid claims of $ 837 million during the first nine months of 2021, and $ 17.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Deferred charges related to the AIG contract were approximately $ 5.0 billion at September 30, 2021 and $ 5.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Note 15. Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of September 30, 2021. Weighted Average Interest Rate September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Insurance and other: Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) In the first nine months of 2021, Berkshire repaid € 550 million and $ 1.5 billion of maturing senior notes. In January 2021, Berkshire issued € 600 million of 0.5 % senior notes due in 2041 . In April 2021, Berkshire issued ¥ 160 billion (approximately $ 1.5 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2041 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5 %. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In January 2021, BHFC repaid $ 750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $ 750 million of 2.5 % senior notes due in 2051 . The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 6.9 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 785.5 billion par at September 30, 2021) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $ 264 million in the third quarter and $ 939 million in the first nine months of 2021. In 2020, exchange rate changes produced pre-tax losses of $ 549 million in the third quarter and $ 447 million in the first nine months. In addition to BHFC borrowings, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $ 3.9 billion of other subsidiary borrowings at September 30, 2021. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. Weighted Average Interest Rate September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2023 - 2051 4.3 % $ 13,001 $ 13,447 Subsidiary and other debt due 2021 - 2064 4.1 % 37,096 36,420 Short-term borrowings 1.6 % 1,968 2,286 Burlington Northern Santa Fe (""BNSF"") and subsidiaries due 2021 - 2097 4.5 % 23,255 23,220 $ 75,320 $ 75,373 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In the first nine months of 2021, BHE and its subsidiaries repaid $ 1.7 billion of term debt and issued $ 2.1 billion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.0 % and maturities ranging from 2051 to 2052 . BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. During the first nine months of 2021, BNSF repaid $ 888 million of debt and issued $ 925 million of 3.3 % term debt due in 2051 . As of September 30, 2021, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2021, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $ 10.5 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included approximately $ 8.8 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 17 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16. Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, other receivables and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of their fair values.

Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 follow (in millions).

These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. 19 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16. Fair value measurements (Continued) Our equity index put option derivative contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. We determine the fair value of the equity index put option contract liabilities based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Note 17. Common stock Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the first nine months of 2021 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Class A, $ 5 Par Value ( 1,650,000 shares authorized) Class B, $ 0.0033 Par Value ( 3,225,000,000 shares authorized) Issued Treasury Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding Balances at December 31, 2020 678,523 ( 34,592 ) 643,931 1,469,359,852 ( 119,316,381 ) 1,350,043,471 Conversions of Class A to Class B common stock ( 11,849 ) — ( 11,849 ) 17,773,500 — 17,773,500 Treasury stock acquired — ( 11,285 ) ( 11,285 ) — ( 59,366,771 ) ( 59,366,771 ) Balances at September 30, 2021 666,674 ( 45,877 ) 620,797 1,487,133,352 ( 178,683,152 ) 1,308,450,200 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,493,097 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2021 and 1,543,960 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times the average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $ 30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note 18. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were 14.7 % for the third quarter and 18.8 % for the first nine months of 2021 compared to 19.8 % for the third quarter and 30.8 % for the first nine months of 2020. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, the magnitude of gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. 20 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. On November 1, 2020 , Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) acquired a large portion of the natural gas transmission and storage business of Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) for approximately $ 2.5 billion. The acquisition included a partial ownership of a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“Cove Point”), consisting of 100 % of the general partnership interest and 25 % of the limited partnership interests. We treat Cove Point as a consolidated subsidiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits which could be significant to Cove Point. The fair value of the assets acquired was $ 13.4 billion, including residual goodwill of $ 1.7 billion, and the fair value of the liabilities assumed was $ 7.0 billion, including the assumption of approximately $ 5.6 billion of debt. We also recorded noncontrolling interests of $ 3.9 billion attributable to limited partnership interests in Cove Point that are held by third parties. In addition, BHE previously agreed to acquire certain other of Dominion’s pipeline business for approximately $ 1.3 billion. Effective July 9, 2021, BHE and Dominion agreed to terminate this planned transaction due to ongoing uncertainty in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals. 21 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 22. Revenues from contracts with customers We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 and 2020 (in millions). Other revenues included in consolidated revenues were primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines and marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management.

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected most of our operating businesses beginning in March of 2020, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter of 2020. Over the second half of 2020 and continuing in 2021, many of these businesses experienced significant recoveries in revenues and earnings, in some instances exceeding pre-pandemic levels. However, many of our businesses were negatively affected by ongoing global supply chain disruptions, including those attributable to major winter storms and a hurricane in North America, which contributed to higher input costs. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at our operations will completely normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Insurance underwriting produced after-tax losses of $784 million in the third quarter and earnings of $356 million in the first nine months of 2021. After-tax incurred losses from significant catastrophe events were approximately $1.7 billion in the third quarter and $2.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021, which were partly offset by reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years’ loss events. Underwriting results in 2021 also reflected earned premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program, higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and higher losses in the life reinsurance business. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased 14.4% in the third quarter and decreased 4.8% in the first nine months of 2021 as compared to 2020, reflecting lower interest income and higher dividend income in both periods. After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 14.2% in the third quarter and 17.4% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. The increases reflected overall higher freight volumes and lower costs due to improved productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel costs. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 7.2% in the third quarter and 13.5% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. The year-to-date increase reflected increased earnings from the utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses, including the effects of a business acquisition, and from the real estate brokerage business. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 15.3% in the third quarter and 42.8% in the first nine months of 2021 versus 2020. Many of our businesses generated significantly higher earnings over the first half of 2021 compared to 2020, which included significant adverse effects from the pandemic. While customer demand for products remained relatively high, earnings in the third quarter of 2021 were sequentially lower than the second quarter. Several of our businesses experienced higher materials, freight and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. Investment and derivative gains and losses in 2021 and 2020 predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 25 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses in excess of $100 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. The significant catastrophe events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida and floods in Europe in the third quarter, as well as Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $125.5 billion as of September 30, 2021. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S.-based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Underwriting results for certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses were negatively affected in 2021 and 2020 by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including estimated provisions for claims and uncollectible premiums and incremental operating costs to maintain customer service levels. The effects of the pandemic in future periods may be affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims and by its effects on general economic activity, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings in 2021 and 2020 were significantly affected by changes in average claims frequencies. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies were significantly below historical levels from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects were partially offset by lower premiums earned from the GEICO Giveback program and higher average claims severities. Starting in the second quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies began to increase as driving by policyholders increased. In addition, average property claims severities increased due to the increase in the valuation of used vehicles. Premiums written increased $1.7 billion (19.5%) in the third quarter and $3.1 billion (11.9%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. The comparative increases reflected the effects of the GEICO Giveback Program, which reduced premiums written $1.5 billion in the third quarter and $2.8 billion in the first nine months of 2020. The GEICO Giveback program provided a 15% premium credit to all new and renewal voluntary auto and motorcycle policies written between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020, and reduced premiums written by approximately $2.9 billion over that six-month period. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 159,000 during the first nine months of 2021. Premiums earned increased $1.1 billion (12.5%) in the third quarter and $1.4 billion (5.2%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. The GEICO Giveback premium credit reduced premiums earned approximately $475 million in 2021 (mostly in the first quarter) and $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2020, including $1.0 billion in the third quarter. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $1.6 billion (23.7%) in the third quarter and $3.3 billion (17.3%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned increased 8.1 percentage points in the third quarter and 8.3 percentage points in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The increases reflected overall increases in average claims frequencies and severities and approximately $400 million in pre-tax losses attributable to Hurricane Ida, partially offset by increased reductions of claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events. Claims frequencies in the first nine months of 2021 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (twelve to thirteen percent range), bodily injury (thirteen to fourteen percent range), personal injury (sixteen to seventeen percent range) and collision (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range). Average claims severities in the first nine months of 2021 were higher for property damage coverage (four to five percent range), collision coverage (thirteen to fourteen percent range) and bodily injury coverage (ten to twelve percent range). Ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events were reduced approximately $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021, which produced corresponding reductions in losses and loss adjustment expenses. The effects of changes in estimates for prior years’ loss events were relatively insignificant in the first nine months of 2020. Underwriting expenses were relatively flat in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting higher technology costs, offset by lower advertising and employee-related expenses. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) decreased 0.7 percentage points in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting the increase in premiums earned.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) Premiums written increased $503 million (16.7%) in the third quarter and $1.8 billion (23.0%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to a 42% year-to-date increase from BH Specialty in professional liability, casualty and property lines of business. In addition, several of our other underwriting units experienced year-to-date premiums written increases, including MedPro Group (19%), NICO Primary (32%), GUARD (8%) and USLI (20%) in various coverages and markets, partly offset by lower volumes for workers’ compensation business. BH Primary’s loss ratio declined 3.8 percentage points in the third quarter and 3.4 percentage points in the first nine months of 2021 versus 2020. The year-to-date decline reflected increased reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $420 million in 2021 compared to $190 million in 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2021 from significant catastrophe events were approximately $260 million in the third quarter and $420 million in the first nine months, arising primarily from Hurricane Ida in the third quarter and Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter. Incurred losses in the first nine months of 2020 included approximately $400 million attributable to the pandemic and Hurricanes Laura and Sally in the third quarter. BH Primary insurers also write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation business and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future, attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Underwriting expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 increased $107 million (16.7%) and $183 million (10.2%), respectively, compared to 2020. The expense ratio decreased 1.7 percentage points in the first nine months of 2021, reflecting changes in business mix. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also offer life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group’s underwriting results follows (in millions).

The increases reflected net new business, increased participations on renewals, improved prices and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $442 million (17.4%) in the third quarter and $448 million (6.2%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. The loss ratio increased 7.9 percentage points in the third quarter and decreased 7.7 percentage points in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2021 included provisions for estimated liabilities arising from significant catastrophe events of approximately $1.5 billion in the third quarter and $1.9 billion in the first nine months. These provisions were attributable to Hurricane Ida and flooding in Europe in the third quarter and Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter. Estimated losses attributable to significant catastrophes in 2020 were approximately $300 million and derived from Hurricanes Laura and Sally in the third quarter. Losses incurred in the first nine months of 2021 also included $564 million from a net decrease in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2020 included a year-to-date net increase in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $342 million and losses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic of $113 million in the third quarter and $688 million in the first nine months. Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. The expense ratio in 2021 increased 1.8 percentage points in the third quarter and decreased 1.5 percentage points in the first nine months compared to the same periods in 2020, attributable to changes in business mix. Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2021 2020 2021 2020 Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 1,332 $ 1,383 $ 3,929 $ 4,153 Premiums earned $ 1,328 100.0 $ 1,378 100.0 $ 3,932 100.0 $ 4,147 100.0 Life and health insurance benefits 1,247 93.9 1,142 82.9 3,733 94.9 3,328 80.3 Underwriting expenses 262 19.7 219 15.9 721 18.4 756 18.2 Total benefits and expenses 1,509 113.6 1,361 98.8 4,454 113.3 4,084 98.5 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ (181 ) $ 17 $ (522 ) $ 63 Life/health premiums written decreased 3.7% in the third quarter and 5.4% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. Premiums written in 2020 included $131 million in the third quarter and $497 million in the first nine months from a policy that covered U.S. health insurance risks that did not renew in 2021. Otherwise, premiums written in the first nine months of 2021 increased 7.7% versus 2020, primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation effects. Underwriting results in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 were negatively affected by significant increases in mortality in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America due to the pandemic. Underwriting results in 2020 reflected COVID-19-related claim estimates of $68 million in the third quarter and $172 million in the first nine months, as well as from increased liabilities from changes in underlying assumptions in estimating disability benefit liabilities in Australia. 29 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Retroactive reinsurance Pre-tax underwriting losses in each period derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Before foreign currency exchange effects, pre-tax underwriting losses were $227 million in the third quarter and $690 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to $282 million in the third quarter and $874 million in the first nine months of 2020. Foreign currency exchange gains were $69 million in the third quarter and $70 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to losses of $112 million in the third quarter and $22 million in the first nine months of 2020. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $39.7 billion at September 30, 2021, declining $1.2 billion since December 31, 2020, primarily due to loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to such reinsurance contracts were $11.7 billion at September 30, 2021, a decline of $709 million since December 31, 2020, primarily attributable to amortization. Deferred charge amortization will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned increased $123 million (180.9%) in the third quarter and $49 million (12.0%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive. Our premium volumes in 2021 and 2020 were constrained, attributable in part to pandemic related delays in underlying claim settlements, which reduced the supply of available business. The volumes written may also change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include the effects of mortality, interest rate changes that may affect expected settlements under certain contracts and gains or losses from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency exchange gains of $45 million in the third quarter and $25 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to losses of $73 million in the third quarter and gains of $38 million in the first nine months of 2020. Excluding foreign currency exchange gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses were $139 million in the third quarter and $399 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to $136 million in the third quarter and $449 million in the first nine months of 2020, which primarily derived from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Pre-tax losses in the first nine months of 2021 were partially offset by the effects of higher mortality and the effects of higher interest rates applicable to settlements under certain contracts. Discounted annuity liabilities were $14.8 billion at September 30, 2021, having a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee contracts produced pre-tax losses of $28 million in the third quarter and earnings of $97 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to earnings of $46 million in the third quarter and losses of $83 million in the first nine months of 2020. The results from these contracts reflect changes in our estimated liabilities for underlying guaranteed benefits, which are affected by changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting results from these contracts are volatile, reflecting the volatility of securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The change in underwriting earnings in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020 was attributable to the net effects of interest rate changes and, to a lesser extent, changes in securities markets, partly offset by lower underlying lapse rate assumptions. 30 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months Percentage Change 2021 2020 2021 2020 Third Quarter First Nine Months Interest and other investment income $ 141 $ 196 $ 458 $ 870 (28.1 )% (47.4 )% Dividend income 1,196 1,024 3,747 3,610 16.8 3.8 Pre-tax net investment income 1,337 1,220 4,205 4,480 9.6 (6.1 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 176 205 617 711 Net investment income $ 1,161 $ 1,015 $ 3,588 $ 3,769 Effective income tax rate 13.1 % 16.9 % 14.7 % 15.9 % Interest and other investment income declined $55 million (28.1%) in the third quarter and $412 million (47.4%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to same periods in 2020, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills. We expect that prevailing low interest rates will continue to negatively affect our earnings from such investments and from fixed maturity securities for at least the remainder of 2021. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Dividend income in 2021 included $26 million in the third quarter and $101 million in the first nine months from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Dividend income may vary from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $145 billion at September 30, 2021 and $138 billion at December 31, 2020. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, and consequently, the average cost of float for each period was negative. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 follows (in millions).

Foreign government securities include obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by national or provincial government entities. 31 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major railroad business groups by type of product shipped which includes consumer products, industrial products, agricultural products and coal. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions).

Cars/Units Third Quarter First Nine Months Percentage Change 2021 2020 2021 2020 Third Quarter First Nine Months Consumer products 1,425 1,390 4,307 3,766 2.5 % 14.4 % Industrial products 443 388 1,280 1,218 14.2 5.1 Agricultural products 265 293 896 855 (9.6 ) 4.8 Coal 404 360 1,127 1,036 12.2 8.8 2,537 2,431 7,610 6,875 4.4 10.7 Railroad operating revenues increased 11.8% in the third quarter and 11.7% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. Railroad operating revenues in 2021 reflected higher volumes of 4.4% in the third quarter and 10.7% in the first nine months, as well as a 5.3% quarter-to-date and a 0.3% year-to-date increase in average revenue per car/unit. Higher rates per car/unit and increased fuel surcharges, principally from higher fuel prices, were offset by business mix changes. Pre-tax earnings were $2.0 billion and $5.7 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively, increases of 14.2% and 16.7%, respectively, compared to the corresponding 2020 periods. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant economic slowdown that adversely affected our volumes in 2020. Revenue changes were driven by continued improvements from the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the ongoing disruptions in the global supply chain. Operating revenues from consumer products were $2.1 billion in the third quarter and $6.1 billion in the first nine months of 2021, increases of 11.2% and 16.3%, respectively, from 2020. Volumes increased 2.5% in the third quarter and 14.4% in the first nine months of 2021, with a higher average revenue per car/unit in both periods. The volume increases for the first nine months of 2021 resulted from growth in intermodal in both international and domestic shipments driven by increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and increased e-commerce activity, as well as from growth in automotive shipments. 32 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad (Continued) Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.4 billion in the third quarter and $3.9 billion in the first nine months of 2021, increases of 15.2% and 3.5%, respectively, from 2020. Volumes increased 14.2% in the third quarter and 5.1% in the first nine months, with a higher average revenue per car/unit in the third quarter and a lower average revenue per car/unit in the first nine months of 2021. The volume increases were primarily due to improvement in the U.S. industrial economy, driving higher volumes in the construction and building sectors, partially offset by lower petroleum volumes due to unfavorable market conditions in the energy sector. Operating revenues from agricultural products decreased 10.4% in the third quarter to $1.1 billion and increased 7.1% to $3.6 billion in the first nine months of 2021, compared to the same periods in 2020. The revenue changes reflected volume decreases of 9.6% in the third quarter due to lower grain exports and lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumes increased 4.8% in the first nine months due to higher domestic and export grain shipments, higher volumes of ethanol and related commodities and higher revenue per car/unit. Operating revenues from coal were $867 million in the third quarter and $2.3 billion in the first nine months of 2021, increases of 33.2% and 18.5%, respectively, from 2020, attributable to higher volumes of 12.2% in the third quarter and 8.8% in the first nine months, as well as from higher average revenue per car/unit. Volume increases in 2021 were attributable to increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand. Railroad operating expenses were $3.3 billion in the third quarter and $10.0 billion in the first nine months of 2021, increases of $342 million (11.4%) and $919 million (10.1%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased 0.2 percentage points to 59.5% in the third quarter and 0.9 percentage points to 61.2% in the first nine months of 2021 versus the 2020 periods. The increases in railroad operating expenses reflected higher volumes and higher average fuel prices, partially offset by productivity improvements. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $63 million (5.7%) in the third quarter and $171 million (5.2%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. The increases were primarily due to increased volumes, partially offset by productivity improvements. Fuel expenses increased $311 million (78.9%) in the third quarter and $613 million (45.9%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher average fuel prices. Purchased service expenses increased $31 million (6.5%) in the third quarter and $96 million (6.7%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher volumes and the effects of insurance recoveries in 2020 related to 2019 flooding, partially offset by improved productivity. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses decreased $55 million (14.0%) in the third quarter, primarily due to a gain on land sale, and increased $43 million (3.5%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher volume-related costs. Utilities and Energy We currently own 91.1% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“LNG interest”), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Three of the natural gas pipeline systems and the LNG interest were acquired on November 1, 2020 from Dominion Energy, Inc. (“BHE GT&S”). Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments. BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. 33 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2021 2020 2021 2020 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 5,225 $ 4,451 $ 14,375 $ 11,504 Real estate operating revenue 1,743 1,742 4,738 3,828 Other income (loss) 45 33 (91 ) 60 Total revenue 7,013 6,226 19,022 15,392 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 1,385 1,169 4,064 3,095 Energy operating expense 2,132 1,952 6,302 5,301 Real estate operating costs and expense 1,608 1,503 4,312 3,492 Interest expense 513 480 1,547 1,430 Total costs and expense 5,638 5,104 16,225 13,318 Pre-tax earnings 1,375 1,122 2,797 2,074 Income tax expense (benefit)* (398 ) (412 ) (842 ) (778 ) Net earnings after income taxes 1,773 1,534 3,639 2,852 Noncontrolling interests of BHE subsidiaries 103 4 311 11 Net earnings attributable to BHE 1,670 1,530 3,328 2,841 Noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends 174 135 389 252 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 1,496 $ 1,395 $ 2,939 $ 2,589 Effective income tax rate (28.9 )% (36.7 )% (30.1 )% (37.5 )% * Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation. The discussion of BHE’s operating results is based on after-tax earnings, reflecting how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated. A summary of net earnings attributable to BHE follows (in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months Percentage Change 2021 2020 2021 2020 Third Quarter First Nine Months PacifiCorp $ 333 $ 286 $ 728 $ 629 16.4 % 15.7 % MidAmerican Energy Company 373 337 728 695 10.7 4.7 NV Energy 282 249 416 367 13.3 13.4 Northern Powergrid 83 26 162 172 219.2 (5.8 ) Natural gas pipelines 144 78 627 321 84.6 95.3 Other energy businesses 230 207 521 527 11.1 (1.1 ) Real estate brokerage 102 177 321 246 (42.4 ) 30.5 Corporate interest and other 123 170 (175 ) (116 ) (27.6 ) 50.9 $ 1,670 $ 1,530 $ 3,328 $ 2,841 9.2 17.1 PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. After-tax earnings increased $47 million in the third quarter and $99 million in the first nine months of 2021 as compared to 2020. These increases reflected higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales), lower operating expenses in the third quarter and increased income tax benefits from the impacts of ratemaking as well as higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. The earnings increases were partially offset by higher year-to-date operating expenses and lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction. The comparative changes in operating expenses reflected increased depreciation expense from the impacts of a deprecation study effective January 1, 2021, and additional assets placed in-service, offset by costs recognized in the third quarter of 2020 associated with a settlement agreement and wildfires. 34 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (Continued) PacifiCorp’s utility margin was approximately $1.0 billion in the third quarter and $2.7 billion in the first nine months of 2021, increases of $6 million and $131 million, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2020. These increases reflected higher retail revenue from increases in customer volumes and higher wholesale and other revenue, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. Retail customer volumes increased 2.1% in the third quarter and 4.4% in the first nine months of 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to higher customer usage, a favorable impact of weather and an increase in the average number of customers. MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased $36 million in the third quarter and $33 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. These increases reflected higher electric utility margin and increased income tax benefits, partly offset by higher operating expenses. The increases in operating expenses included incremental costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service and higher natural gas distribution costs, partially offset by storm restoration costs recognized in the third quarter of 2020. The income tax benefit increases were mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, partially offset by the impacts of ratemaking. MEC’s electric utility margin was $691 million in the third quarter and $1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2021, increases of 13% and 8%, respectively, versus 2020. These increases were attributable to higher operating revenue from wholesale and retail customer volumes, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes increased 5.6% in the third quarter and 6.5% in the first nine months of 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to increased usage by certain industrial customers and the favorable impacts of weather. NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings increased $33 million in the third quarter and $49 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. These increases reflected lower operating expenses, lower interest expense and lower income tax expense from the impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by lower electric utility margin. The decreases in operating expenses were mainly due to lower comparative accruals for earnings sharing, partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service. NV Energy’s electric utility margin was $621 million in the third quarter and $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2021, decreases of 6% and 4%, respectively, compared to 2020. These decreases were primarily due to revenue reductions from lower base tariff general rates and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020, partially offset by a 4.2% increase in electric retail customer volumes for the first nine months of 2021, price impacts from changes in sales mix and an increase in the average number of customers. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to higher customer usage and the favorable impacts of weather. Northern Powergrid’s after-tax earnings increased $57 million in the third quarter and decreased $10 million in the first nine months of 2021 as compared to 2020. These changes reflected the impacts of changes in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate, higher distribution revenue, mainly from increased tariff rates and units distributed, and from favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2021. Earnings in the first nine months of 2021 included deferred income tax expense of $109 million related to the enactment in June 2021 of an increase in the income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023, while earnings in each period of 2020 included deferred income tax expense of $35 million related to the enactment in July 2020 of an increase in the income tax rate from 17% to 19%, effective April 1, 2020. Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings increased $66 million in the third quarter and $306 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 from BHE GT&S were $74 million in the third quarter and $247 million in the first nine months. In addition, year-to-date earnings increased from the effects of higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas, largely due to increased demand from the February 2021 winter storms. Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings increased $23 million in the third quarter and decreased $6 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. The third quarter earnings increase was mainly due to higher operating revenue from a transmission investment. The decrease in year-to-date earnings was primarily due to a decline in wind tax equity investment earnings of $48 million, partially offset by higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects. The decrease in wind tax equity investment earnings was primarily due to increased losses from preexisting tax equity investments of $123 million, largely attributable to the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. 35 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (Continued) Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings decreased $75 million in the third quarter and increased $75 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in the third quarter reflected lower earnings from mortgage services due to a decrease in funded volume largely attributable to a decrease in refinance activity. The earnings increase during the first nine months was due to a comparative increase in closed brokerage transaction volumes in 2021. Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $47 million in the third quarter and $59 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting lower federal income tax credits recognized, changes in operating expenses (lower in the third quarter and higher in the first nine months) and higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2020, as well as higher earnings from non-regulated energy services. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months Percentage Change 2021 2020 2021 2020 Third Quarter First Nine Months Revenues Manufacturing $ 17,496 $ 15,170 $ 50,821 $ 43,238 15.3 % 17.5 % Service and retailing 21,291 19,319 62,143 55,351 10.2 12.3 $ 38,787 $ 34,489 $ 112,964 $ 98,589 Pre-tax earnings Manufacturing $ 2,445 $ 2,255 $ 7,595 $ 5,765 8.4 % 31.7 % Service and retailing 1,102 875 3,413 1,950 25.9 75.0 3,547 3,130 11,008 7,715 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 841 784 2,679 1,882 Net earnings* $ 2,706 $ 2,346 $ 8,329 $ 5,833 Effective income tax rate 22.9 % 24.4 % 23.7 % 24.0 % Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues 9.1 % 9.1 % 9.7 % 7.8 % * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which were primarily from the amortization of identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings were $169 million in the third quarter and $532 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to $195 million in the third quarter and $593 million in the first nine months of 2020. In the first nine months of 2020, net earnings also excluded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset after-tax impairment charges of $10.4 billion. The acquisition accounting expense and impairment charges are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page 25 and in the “Other” earnings section on page 42. 36 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2021 2020 2021 2020 Revenues Industrial products $ 7,192 $ 6,173 $ 21,050 $ 19,320 Building products 6,374 5,672 18,404 15,497 Consumer products 3,930 3,325 11,367 8,421 $ 17,496 $ 15,170 $ 50,821 $ 43,238 Pre-tax earnings Industrial products $ 1,124 $ 940 $ 3,508 $ 2,781 Building products 833 825 2,576 2,088 Consumer products 488 490 1,511 896 $ 2,445 $ 2,255 $ 7,595 $ 5,765 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Industrial products 15.6 % 15.2 % 16.7 % 14.4 % Building products 13.1 % 14.5 % 14.0 % 13.5 % Consumer products 12.4 % 14.7 % 13.3 % 10.6 % Industrial products The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)) and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, including equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries, which are internally aggregated into eleven groups. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Revenues of the industrial products group in 2021 increased $1.0 billion (16.5%) in the third quarter and $1.7 billion (9.0%) in the first nine months compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings in 2021 increased $184 million (19.6%) in the third quarter and $727 million (26.1%) in the first nine months compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 16.7% for the first nine months of 2021, an increase of 2.3 percentage points compared to 2020. PCC’s revenues were $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 6.6% over 2020, while revenues in the first nine months decreased 16.4% compared to 2020. Historically, PCC has derived significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) aircraft production in 2020. While commercial air travel in the U.S. increased in 2021, global demand remains below pre-pandemic levels, as efforts to manage the pandemic continue. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased $217 million in the third quarter and $445 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. The increases reflect the aggressive actions previously taken by management to resize and restructure operations. We do not expect significant increases in PCC’s aerospace revenues or earnings to occur in the near term attributable to relatively low aircraft build rates, inventory levels currently within the industry supply chain and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial air travel. Lubrizol’s revenues were approximately $1.6 billion in the third quarter and $5.0 billion in the first nine months of 2021, increases of 9.6% and 13.4%, respectively, over the same periods in 2020. The increases reflected higher average selling prices, driven by significant increases in materials and other manufacturing costs, as well as higher volumes in the first nine months. Sales volumes in the Additives product lines were negatively affected by severe winter storms in February 2021, which caused the temporary shut-down of several U.S. facilities, as well as other temporary production shut-downs in the third quarter of 2021. 37 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings decreased 76.9% in the third quarter and 39.0% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 were negatively impacted by significant losses related to a fire in June 2021 at a facility of Chemtool Incorporated, a Lubrizol subsidiary, located in Rockton, Illinois and impairment charges in the third quarter related to an underperforming business in the Advanced Materials product lines. These losses and charges aggregated $73 million in the third quarter and $229 million in the first nine months of 2021. Earnings in 2021 were also negatively impacted by the effects of accelerating raw material costs and the previously mentioned temporary shut-down of Additives production, which resulted in lost sales and incremental manufacturing costs. Marmon’s revenues were $2.6 billion in the third quarter and $7.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021, increases of 30.0% and 26.3%, respectively, compared to 2020. The revenue increases were primarily due to higher metal prices in the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups and higher volumes in most of Marmon’s other business groups, particularly those serving the construction, automotive, heavy-duty truck and restaurant markets. These increases were partially offset by the impact of divestitures and business closures in the Water Technologies and Retail Solutions groups and a year-to-date decline in Rail & Leasing group revenues. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 increased $106 million (38.3%) in the third quarter and $268 million (33.5%) in the first nine months compared to 2020. Earnings in the first nine months of 2021 reflected higher earnings across several business groups, partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Water Technologies groups. IMC’s revenues were $862 million in the third quarter and $2.7 billion in the first nine months of 2021, increases of 23.4% in the third quarter and 22.2% in the first nine months compared to 2020. Revenues in the first nine months of 2021 reflected improving business conditions in most geographic regions and favorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 59.4% in the third quarter and 63.6% in the first nine months of 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to higher customer demand, improved manufacturing efficiencies, operating cost management saving initiatives and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Revenues of the building products group increased $702 million (12.4%) in the third quarter and $2.9 billion (18.8%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. Residential housing construction in the U.S. was strong during 2020 and through the first nine months of 2021. However, the effects of persistent supply chain disruptions limited our sales and contributed to production delays and significant cost increases for key materials and inputs, including lumber, steel, petrochemical-based materials, energy, freight, labor and fixtures. These effects necessitated sales price increases. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $2.6 billion in the third quarter and $7.6 billion in the first nine months of 2021, increases of $317 million (13.7%) and $1.5 billion (24.5%), respectively, compared to 2020. Revenues from home sales increased $297 million (16.6%) in the third quarter and $1.4 billion (29.4%) in the first nine months of 2021, reflecting a net increase in units sold, increased revenue per home sold and changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 22.7% in the first nine months of 2021, while factory-built manufactured home unit sales increased 4.5%. Unit sales of site-built homes declined in the third quarter of 2021 versus 2020, attributable to longer construction periods arising from supply chain constraints and labor shortages. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 9.6% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $18.3 billion as of September 30, 2021, an increase of approximately $1.2 billion compared to December 31, 2020. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $3.7 billion in the third quarter and $10.8 billion in the first nine months of 2021, increases of $385 million (11.5%) and $1.4 billion (15.0%), respectively, versus 2020. The increases were primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by higher input and supply chain costs, as well as higher unit volumes for paint and coatings and certain residential flooring, insulation and engineered products. 38 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) Pre-tax earnings of our building products group were relatively unchanged in the third quarter of 2021 versus 2020, while earnings increased $488 million (23.4%) in the first nine months. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $391 million in the third quarter and $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021, increases of $52 million (15.3%) and $380 million (44.2%), respectively, compared to 2020. Earnings in the first nine months of 2021 reflected higher earnings from home sales, mortgage originations, net interest income and a decline of $116 million in the provision for expected credit losses, partially offset by the impact of rising manufacturing and supply chain costs. The provision for expected credit losses in the first nine months of 2020 were unusually high and included provisions for the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The comparative decline in the provision for expected credit losses is due to fewer actual and anticipated loan foreclosures. Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses declined $45 million (9.2%) in the third quarter and increased $108 million (8.8%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 2.7 percentage points in the third quarter and 0.7 percentage points in the first nine months of 2021 versus 2020. While customer demand was generally strong, reduced availability of materials and other product inputs from supply chain disruptions negatively affected sales and operating results. Higher materials costs, reduced availability of certain materials and freight services and higher restructuring and impairment charges reduced our pre-tax margin rates in 2021. Consumer products The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). Consumer products revenues increased approximately $605 million (18.2%) in the third quarter and $2.9 billion (35.0%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues from Forest River increased 24.7% in the third quarter and 45.3% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020, driven by a year-to-date unit sales increase of 37.5% in recreational vehicles. Revenues in 2021 were, in general, significantly higher at several of our other businesses that were severely impacted by the pandemic in the first half of 2020. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 18.5% in the third quarter and 35.4% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting significant comparative increases in unit sales, attributable in part to inventory restocking by certain customers and increased consumer demand. Pre-tax earnings of our consumer products group were substantially unchanged in the third quarter and increased $615 million (68.6%) in the first nine months of 2021 versus 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 2.3 percentage points in the third quarter and increased 2.7 percentage points in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. Earnings in the third quarter reflected higher earnings at Forest River offset by lower earnings from Duracell and the apparel and footwear businesses. The comparative increase in pre-tax earnings for the first nine months reflected significant earnings increases at all of our businesses, driven by Forest River, the apparel and footwear businesses and Duracell. Our consumer products businesses are also experiencing cost increases attributable to supply chain disruptions. 39 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings (loss) of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2021 2020 2021 2020 Revenues Service $ 4,131 $ 3,068 $ 11,718 $ 9,093 Retailing 4,548 4,211 13,896 11,179 McLane Company 12,612 12,040 36,529 35,079 $ 21,291 $ 19,319 $ 62,143 $ 55,351 Pre-tax earnings (loss) Service $ 696 $ 470 $ 2,013 $ 1,155 Retailing 414 309 1,221 590 McLane Company (8 ) 96 179 205 $ 1,102 $ 875 $ 3,413 $ 1,950 Pre-tax earnings (loss) as a percentage of revenues Service 16.8 % 15.3 % 17.2 % 12.7 % Retailing 9.1 % 7.3 % 8.8 % 5.3 % McLane Company (0.1 )% 0.8 % 0.5 % 0.6 % Service Our service business group offers shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI), franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen) and offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA), furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and the operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Service group revenues increased $1.1 billion (34.6%) in the third quarter and $2.6 billion (28.9%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues from TTI increased 45.3% in the third quarter and 40.9% in the first nine months of 2021 versus 2020. The increases reflected accelerating demand across all significant markets, as customers attempt to maintain adequate inventories in response to high demand for components in end products and supply chain disruptions. Revenues from aviation services (NetJets and FlightSafety) increased 31.0% in the third quarter and 25.4% in the first nine months of 2021 over low 2020 levels, primarily due to higher training hours and significantly higher customer flight hours. Pre-tax earnings of the group increased $226 million (48.1%) in the third quarter and $858 million (74.3%) in the first nine months of 2021 versus 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues increased 1.5 percentage points in the third quarter and 4.5 percentage points in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in earnings for the third quarter was primarily due to TTI. Earnings at most of our service businesses increased significantly in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020, with the largest increases from TTI and the aviation services businesses. The increases in year-to-date earnings from NetJets and FlightSafety were primarily attributable to improved operating margins from higher volume, changes in business mix, increased operating efficiencies and the effects of past restructuring efforts. TTI’s earnings increases were primarily attributable to the increases in sales and improved operating cost leverage. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”), which consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA represents about 64% of our combined retailing revenues in the first nine months of 2021. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics and represent about 21% of the combined retailing revenues in the first nine months of 2021. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories. 40 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) Retailing group revenues increased approximately $337 million (8.0%) in the third quarter and $2.7 billion (24.3%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. BHA’s revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 increased 9.8% and 22.2%, respectively, over 2020, primarily due to increases in pre-owned vehicle unit sales, higher volumes of new auto sales in the first six months, and higher average selling prices. New auto unit sales declined significantly in the third quarter of 2021, reflecting inventory shortages caused by supply chain disruption at OEMs. Home furnishings group revenues increased 11.7% in the third quarter and 27.5% in the first nine months of 2021 as compared to 2020 attributable to higher consumer demand and higher average selling prices. Pre-tax earnings increased $105 million (34.0%) in the third quarter and $631 million (106.9%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. Operating results of our retailing businesses were severely impacted by the pandemic beginning in March of 2020 and continued through the second quarter of 2020. Over the second half of 2020 and through the first six months of 2021, revenues and pre-tax earnings of these businesses increased, and in certain instances increased to levels exceeding those in pre-pandemic periods. Results in the third quarter of 2021 moderated somewhat relative to the first six months reflecting the effects of supply chain disruptions, which, in particular, worsened with respect to new automobiles. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 26.2% in the third quarter and 47.3% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increases in vehicle sales margins and earnings from finance and service contract activities, as well as from lower floorplan interest expense, primarily attributable to significant declines in inventory levels, and from operating cost control efforts. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $63 million in the third quarter and $447 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. The initial effects of the pandemic in 2020 were severe for most of our other retailers due to the restricted operations at many of those businesses during the first half of 2020. Results in 2021 also benefitted from relatively strong consumer demand and the effects of restructuring efforts in 2020. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales typically comprise about two-thirds of McLane’s consolidated sales with foodservice comprising much of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. The grocery and foodservice businesses continue to operate in an intensely competitive business environment. Revenues increased $572 million (4.8%) in the third quarter and $1.45 billion (4.1%) in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues from the grocery business were relatively unchanged over the first nine months of 2021, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 10.9% and 21.1%, respectively, compared to the first nine months of 2020. The foodservice business was significantly impacted by pandemic-related restaurant closures in 2020. Pre-tax earnings decreased $104 million in the third quarter and $26 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to 2020. The decreases were primarily attributable to higher personnel costs and fuel expense. McLane’s operations have been adversely affected by supply chain disruptions, including shortages of truck drivers, affecting inventory and customer deliveries. There is increased competition for drivers within the trucking industry. The increase in fuel expense was primarily attributable to significant increases in petroleum prices. Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative contract gains/losses follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2021 2020 2021 2020 Investment gains/losses $ 4,851 $ 31,625 $ 37,235 $ 2,032 Derivative contract gains/losses 70 (43 ) 780 (640 ) Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 4,921 31,582 38,015 1,392 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,043 6,845 8,036 627 Net earnings $ 3,878 $ 24,737 $ 29,979 $ 765 Effective income tax rate 20.7 % 21.3 % 20.9 % 35.1 % 41 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses (Continued) Investment gains/losses Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains/losses included net unrealized gains of $4.8 billion in the third quarter and $36.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021 compared to net unrealized gains of $30.8 billion in the third quarter and $16.5 billion in the first nine months of 2020 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Investment losses from market value changes in the first nine months of 2020 on equity securities sold in 2020 were $13.9 billion. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold, which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $0.9 billion in the third quarter and $2.9 billion in the first nine months of 2021. Taxable investment gains on equity securities were $3.9 billion in the third quarter and $0.7 billion in the first nine months of 2020. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative contract gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant due to the volatility of market prices in the underlying equity markets. As of September 30, 2021, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was $83 million and our recorded liability at fair value was $286 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under these contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2021 2020 2021 2020 Equity method earnings $ 310 $ 244 $ 665 $ 346 Acquisition accounting expenses (169 ) (195 ) (532 ) (593 ) Goodwill and intangible asset impairments — (19 ) — (10,369 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (75 ) (80 ) (232 ) (252 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes 196 (412 ) 676 (329 ) Income tax expense adjustments — (60 ) — (60 ) Other 87 32 76 363 $ 349 $ (490 ) $ 653 $ (10,894 ) After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. Our after-tax earnings from Kraft Heinz were $168 million for the third quarter and $323 million for the first nine months of 2021. Our Kraft Heinz investment produced after-tax earnings of $142 million for the third quarter and an after-tax loss of $56 million for the first nine months of 2020, which included after-tax losses of $59 million in the third quarter and $611 million in the first nine months associated with goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the first nine months of 2020 included $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. 42 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2021 was $472 billion, an increase of $29.3 billion since December 31, 2020. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders were $50.1 billion in the first nine months of 2021 and included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $29.4 billion. Changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities can produce significant volatility in our earnings. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $20.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. At September 30, 2021, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $144.4 billion, which included $116.6 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $328.9 billion. Berkshire parent company outstanding debt at September 30, 2021 was $21.8 billion, a decrease of $886 million since December 31, 2020, which was primarily due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt. In the first nine months of 2021, Berkshire repaid €550 million and $1.5 billion of maturing senior notes. In the first nine months of 2021, Berkshire issued €600 million of 0.5% senior notes due in 2041 and ¥160 billion (approximately $1.5 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2041 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. Berkshire parent company debt maturing over the next twelve months is $600 million. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $17.9 billion at September 30, 2021, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $13.1 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In January 2021, BHFC repaid $750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $750 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2051. BHFC debt maturing over the next twelve months is $775 million. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of these two operations in the first nine months of 2021 were $6.7 billion and we currently forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $3.1 billion over the remainder of 2021. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.3 billion as of September 30, 2021, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2020. During the first nine months of 2021, BNSF repaid $888 million of debt and issued $925 million of 3.3% debentures due in 2051. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $52.1 billion at September 30, 2021, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2020. During the first nine months of 2021, BHE and its subsidiaries repaid $1.7 billion of term debt and issued $2.1 billion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.0% with due dates in 2051 and 2052, and short-term borrowings decreased by $318 million. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $2.4 billion. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future are not currently reflected in the financial statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events and the actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 43 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations (Continued) In the first nine months of 2021, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $5.9 billion in the aggregate. Principal and interest payments associated with these borrowings are expected as follows: in 2021 – $27 million; in 2022 through 2025 – $121 million per annum; and thereafter – $8.8 billion. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2021 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in the “Contractual Obligations” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2021 includes estimated liabilities of $125.5 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2021 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.8 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2020. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. As of September 30, 2021, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently anticipate, and we may need to record goodwill or indefinite-lived asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units and judgments on goodwill impairments at this time are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on a reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. As of the most recent annual goodwill impairment review, the estimated fair values of certain reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $35.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $32.1 billion by 10.6%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the four other reporting units where estimated fair value did not exceed carrying value by at least 20%, their aggregate estimated fair value of approximately $1.5 billion exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $1.4 billion by 10.0%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $600 million. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 44 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of September 30, 2021, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. 45 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use o f Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the third quarter of 2021 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program July Class A common stock 938 $ 420,100.50 938 * Class B common stock 6,387,847 $ 278.13 6,387,847 * August Class A common stock 868 $ 430,704.66 868 * Class B common stock 6,535,695 $ 285.41 6,535,695 * September Class A common stock 1,323 $ 419,236.93 1,323 * Class B common stock 9,580,995 $ 277.74 9,580,995 * * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $30 billion.

accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 6 BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2021 Note 1. General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, changes in the fair values of certain derivative contract liabilities, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the magnitude of asset impairment charges can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread rapidly across the world in 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in March of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected nearly all of our operations during 2020 and in particular during the second quarter, although the effects varied significantly. The extent of the effects over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Risks and uncertainties resulting from the pandemic that may affect our future earnings, cash flows and financial condition include the ability to vaccinate a significant number of people in the U.S. and throughout the world as well as the long-term effect from the pandemic on the demand for certain of our products and services. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2. New accounting pronouncements We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January 1, 2020 . ASC 326 provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried at amortized cost based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses therefore include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a charge to retained earnings of $ 388 million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses, which was primarily related to our manufactured housing loans. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts.” ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used to value policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts, with the effects of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount rate assumptions reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 7 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.

The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 325,442,152 shares of Kraft Heinz common stock representing 26.6 % of the outstanding shares. Our investment in Kraft Heinz produced an equity method loss of $ 7 million in the second quarter and earnings of $ 143 million in the first six months of 2021. In 2020, we recorded losses attributable to Kraft Heinz of $ 440 million in the second quarter and $ 339 million in the first six months which included our proportionate share of the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz of approximately $ 700 million for the second quarter and $ 750 million for the first six months. We received dividends on the common stock of $ 260 million in each of the first six months of 2021 and 2020, which were recorded as reductions to the carrying value of our investment. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $ 13.3 billion at June 30, 2021 and $ 11.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $ 13.3 billion at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Summarized consolidated financial information of Kraft Heinz follows (in millions).

Other investments that we account for pursuant to the equity method include Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”) and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”). The aggregate carrying value of these investments was approximately $ 3.2 billion as of June 30, 2021 and $ 4.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. Our equity method earnings from these entities in the first six months were $ 255 million in 2021 and $ 382 million in 2020. During the first six months of 2021, we received distributions from these other investees of $ 982 million, including a non-recurring distribution received from Pilot of $ 849 million in the first quarter. Additional information concerning these investments follows. We own a 50 % interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50 % interest. Berkadia provides capital solutions, investments sales advisory and mortgage servicing for multifamily and commercial real estate. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through commercial paper, which was $ 1.47 billion at June 30, 2021 and is limited to $ 1.5 billion. Berkadia’s commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. 9 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5. Equity method investments (Continued) A Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company subsidiary owns a 50 % interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint. American Electric Power owns the other 50 % interest. In 2017, we acquired a 38.6 % interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North America through more than 1,000 retail locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces and through wholesale distribution. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1 % interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining 11.3 % interest. We also entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4 % interest in Pilot in 2023, with the Haslam family retaining a 20 % interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023. Note 6.

Second Quarter First Six Months 2021 2020 2021 2020 Investment gains (losses): Equity securities: Change in unrealized investment gains (losses) during the period on securities held at the end of the period $ 27,014 $ 39,369 $ 31,548 $ ( 18,377 ) Investment gains (losses) on securities sold during the period 144 ( 87 ) 670 ( 11,233 ) 27,158 39,282 32,218 ( 29,610 ) Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains 15 25 35 41 Gross realized losses ( 12 ) ( 14 ) ( 13 ) ( 20 ) Other 12 ( 4 ) 144 ( 4 ) Investment gains (losses) 27,173 39,289 32,384 ( 29,593 ) Derivative contract gains (losses) 221 796 710 ( 597 ) $ 27,394 $ 40,085 $ 33,094 $ ( 30,190 ) Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the period. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $ 8.6 billion in the first six months of 2021 and $ 15.7 billion in the first six months of 2020. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the period reflect the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable quarterly period or, if later, the purchase date. Our taxable gains/losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Taxable gains in the second quarter and first six months of 2021 were $ 228 million and $ 2.0 billion, respectively, and taxable losses were $ 4.5 billion and $ 3.3 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2020, respectively. The derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. Information related to these contracts follows (dollars in millions). June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Balance sheet liabilities - at fair value $ 355 $ 1,065 Notional value 9,809 10,991 Intrinsic value 72 727 Weighted average remaining life (in years) 0.8 1.2 Notional value in the preceding table represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming the value of each index is zero at each contract’s expiration date. Intrinsic value is the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Substantially all open contracts as of June 30, 2021 will expire by February 2023 . Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike price at the contract expiration date. We received aggregate premiums on the contract inception dates of $ 1.9 billion with respect to unexpired contracts as of June 30, 2021 and we have no counterparty credit risk. 10 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7.

The outstanding loan under the facility was approximately $ 1.6 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and is secured by mortgages on real estate properties. In the first quarter of 2020, we provided a loan to Lee Enterprises, Inc. in connection with its acquisition of our newspaper operations and the repayment of its then outstanding credit facilities. The loan balance was $ 485 million as of June 30, 2021 and $ 524 million at December 31, 2020. We are the sole lender to each of these entities and each of these loans is current as to payment status. Note 8. Other receivables Other receivables are comprised of the following (in millions).

Goodwill and other intangible assets Reconciliations of the changes in the carrying value of goodwill for the first six months of 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020 follow (in millions). June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Balance at beginning of year $ 73,734 $ 81,882 Acquisitions of businesses 25 1,758 Impairment charges — ( 10,033 ) Other, including foreign currency translation ( 1 ) 127 Balance at end of period* $ 73,758 $ 73,734 * Net of accumulated goodwill impairments of $ 11.0 billion as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Goodwill and other intangible assets (Continued) Intangible asset amortization expense in the first six months was $ 637 million in 2021 and $ 647 million in 2020. Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $ 18.3 billion as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. During 2020, we concluded it was necessary to reevaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of certain of our reporting units for impairment due to the disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of approximately $ 10 billion and pre-tax indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $ 638 million in the second quarter of 2020. Approximately $ 10 billion of these charges related to Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), the largest business within Berkshire's manufacturing segment. The carrying value of PCC-related goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets prior to the impairment charges was approximately $ 31 billion. Note 13. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 14), for each of the six-month periods ending June 30, 2021 and 2020 follows (in millions). 2021 2020 Balances at beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 79,854 $ 73,019 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 2,912 ) ( 2,855 ) Net liabilities 76,942 70,164 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events 23,651 20,278 Prior accident years’ events ( 1,064 ) 189 Total 22,587 20,467 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events ( 8,406 ) ( 6,638 ) Prior accident years’ events ( 11,169 ) ( 11,155 ) Total ( 19,575 ) ( 17,793 ) Foreign currency translation adjustment 31 ( 78 ) Balances at June 30: Net liabilities 79,985 72,760 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 2,973 2,909 Gross liabilities $ 82,958 $ 75,669 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). We recorded a net reduction of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 1.1 billion in the first six months of 2021 compared to a net increase of $ 189 million in 2020, which produced a corresponding decrease in 2021 and an increase in 2020 in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. These amounts represented 1.4 % in 2021 and 0.3 % in 2020 of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events in the first six months were reduced $ 1.1 billion in 2021 and $ 250 million in 2020 with respect to primary insurance. In each period, the reductions were primarily attributable to private passenger automobile, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to reinsurance assumed in the first six months increased $ 35 million in 2021 and $ 439 million in 2020, which included increased provisions for legacy casualty exposures. 14 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the six-month periods ending June 30, 2021 and 2020 follow (in millions). 2021 2020 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Balances at beginning of year $ 40,966 $ ( 12,441 ) $ 42,441 $ ( 13,747 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current year contracts 82 — — — Prior years’ contracts ( 3 ) 473 24 554 Total 79 473 24 554 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 808 ) — ( 628 ) — Balances at June 30 $ 40,237 $ ( 11,968 ) $ 41,837 $ ( 13,193 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 552 $ 578 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflects when our exposure to losses begins. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for prior years’ contracts were $ 470 million in 2021 and $ 578 million in 2020, which consisted of recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effects of changes in the expected timing and amount of future loss payments. Berkshire’s subsidiary, National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), is party to a contract with certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”), in which NICO’s ultimate liability is contractually limited to $ 20 billion. Our estimated unpaid claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $ 17.1 billion at June 30, 2021, reflecting paid claims of $ 549 million during the first six months of 2021, and $ 17.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Deferred charge assets related to the AIG contract were approximately $ 5.1 billion at June 30, 2021 and $ 5.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Note 15. Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of June 30, 2021. Weighted Average Interest Rate June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Insurance and other: Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) In the first quarter of 2021, Berkshire repaid € 550 million and $ 1.0 billion of maturing senior notes and issued € 600 million of 0.5 % senior notes due in 2041 . In April 2021, Berkshire issued ¥ 160 billion (approximately $ 1.5 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2041 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5 %. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In January 2021, BHFC repaid $ 750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $ 750 million of 2.5 % senior notes due in 2051 . The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 6.9 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 785.5 billion par at June 30, 2021) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $ 675 million in the first six months of 2021 and $ 102 million in the first six months of 2020. In addition to BHFC borrowings, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $ 4.0 billion of other subsidiary borrowings at June 30, 2021. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. Weighted Average Interest Rate June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2023 - 2051 4.3 % $ 13,000 $ 13,447 Subsidiary and other debt due 2021 - 2064 4.2 % 35,873 36,420 Short-term borrowings 1.5 % 2,536 2,286 Burlington Northern Santa Fe (""BNSF"") and subsidiaries due 2021 - 2097 4.6 % 23,253 23,220 $ 74,662 $ 75,373 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In the first six months of 2021, BHE and its subsidiaries repaid $ 1.7 billion of term debt. In April 2021, a BHE subsidiary issued $ 550 million of 3.4 % term debt due in 2051 . BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. During the first six months of 2021, BNSF repaid $ 886 million of debt. In April 2021, BNSF issued $ 925 million of 3.3 % term debt due in 2051 . As of June 30, 2021, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2021, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $ 9.9 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included approximately $ 8.4 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 16 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16. Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions).

Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 follow (in millions). Balance at beginning of year Gains (losses) included in earnings Acquisitions, dispositions and settlements Balance at June 30 Investments in equity securities: 2021 $ 8,978 $ 1,559 $ 1,100 $ 11,637 2020 10,405 ( 2,469 ) — 7,936 Equity index put option contract liabilities: 2021 ( 1,065 ) 710 — ( 355 ) 2020 ( 968 ) ( 597 ) — ( 1,565 ) Quantitative information as of June 30, 2021 with respect to significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follows (dollars in millions). Fair Value Principal Valuation Techniques Unobservable Inputs Weighted Average Investments in equity securities: Preferred stock $ 10,935 Discounted cash flow Expected duration 8 years Discount for transferability restrictions and subordination 355 basis points Common stock warrants 702 Warrant pricing model Expected duration 8 years Volatility 36 % Equity index put option contract liabilities 355 Option pricing model Volatility 17 % Investments in equity securities in the preceding table include our investments in certain preferred stocks and common stock warrants that do not have readily determinable market values as defined under GAAP. These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. 18 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16. Fair value measurements (Continued) Our equity index put option derivative contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. We determine the fair value of the equity index put option contract liabilities based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Note 17. Common stock Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the first six months of 2021 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Class A, $ 5 Par Value ( 1,650,000 shares authorized) Class B, $ 0.0033 Par Value ( 3,225,000,000 shares authorized) Issued Treasury Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding Balances at December 31, 2020 678,523 ( 34,592 ) 643,931 1,469,359,852 ( 119,316,381 ) 1,350,043,471 Conversions of Class A to Class B common stock ( 11,479 ) — ( 11,479 ) 17,218,500 — 17,218,500 Treasury stock acquired — ( 8,156 ) ( 8,156 ) — ( 36,862,234 ) ( 36,862,234 ) Balances at June 30, 2021 667,044 ( 42,748 ) 624,296 1,486,578,352 ( 156,178,615 ) 1,330,399,737 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,511,229 shares outstanding as of June 30, 2021 and 1,543,960 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times the average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $ 30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note 18. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were 20.4 % for the second quarter and 19.9 % for the first six months of 2021 compared to 25.4 % for the second quarter and 15.7 % for the first six months of 2020. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, the magnitude of gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. 19 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. On November 1, 2020 , Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) acquired a large portion of the natural gas transmission and storage business of Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) for approximately $ 2.5 billion. The acquisition included a partial ownership of a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“Cove Point”), consisting of 100 % of the general partnership interest and 25 % of the limited partnership interests. We treat Cove Point as a consolidated subsidiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits which could be significant to Cove Point. The preliminary fair value of the assets acquired was $ 13.4 billion, including residual goodwill of $ 1.7 billion, and the fair value of the liabilities assumed was $ 7.0 billion, including the assumption of approximately $ 5.6 billion of debt. We also recorded noncontrolling interests of $ 3.9 billion attributable to limited partnership interests in Cove Point that are held by third parties. In addition, BHE previously agreed to acquire certain other of Dominion’s pipeline business for approximately $ 1.3 billion. Effective July 9, 2021, BHE and Dominion agreed to terminate this planned transaction due to ongoing uncertainty in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals. 20 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 22. Revenues from contracts with customers We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the second quarter and first six months of 2021 and 2020 (in millions). Other revenues included in consolidated revenues were primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. Revenues and earnings before income taxes by segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings/loss attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions).

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected most of our operating businesses beginning in March of 2020, with the initial effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter of 2020. Over the second half of 2020 and continuing in 2021, many of these businesses experienced significant recoveries in revenues and earnings, in some instances exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Consequently, earnings over the first six months of 2021 for these businesses were considerably higher than in the first half of 2020, although earnings in 2021 were negatively affected by major winter storms in North America during February 2021, ongoing supply chain disruptions and higher input costs. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at our operations will completely normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Insurance underwriting produced after-tax earnings of $376 million in the second quarter and $1.1 billion in the first six months of 2021. In 2021, our primary insurance operations generated underwriting earnings, while our reinsurance operations produced underwriting losses. Underwriting results in 2021 reflected earned premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program, higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and higher losses in the life reinsurance business. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income declined $149 million (10.9%) in the second quarter and $327 million (11.9%) in the first six months of 2021 as compared to 2020. The declines were primarily due to lower interest income earned on cash and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills. After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 34.0% in the second quarter and 19.2% in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. The increases reflected overall higher freight volumes and lower costs due to improved productivity. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 20.9% in the first half of 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected increased earnings from the natural gas pipelines, including the effects of a business acquisition, and from the real estate brokerage businesses. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased $1.6 billion in the second quarter and $2.1 billion in the first six months of 2021 versus 2020. Many of our businesses generated significantly higher earnings over the first half of 2021 compared to 2020, which included significant adverse effects from the pandemic. Earnings of our manufacturing, service and retail businesses in 2021 benefitted from higher customer demand in many of our businesses and exceeded earnings in 2019 as well. Investment and derivative gains and losses in 2021 and 2020 predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 24 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses in excess of $100 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $123.2 billion as of June 30, 2021. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S.-based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Underwriting results for certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses were negatively affected in 2021 and 2020 by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including estimated provisions for claims and uncollectible premiums and incremental operating costs to maintain customer service levels. The effects of the pandemic in future periods may be affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims and by its effects on general economic activity, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).

Beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies were significantly below historical levels from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects were partially offset by lower premiums earned from the GEICO Giveback program and higher average claims severities. In the second quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies began to increase as driving by policyholders increased. 25 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Premiums written increased $1.1 billion (14.1%) in the second quarter and $1.5 billion (8.2%) in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. The premium increases were primarily attributable to the $1.3 billion reduction in premiums written during the second quarter of 2020 from the GEICO Giveback Program and also by a 4.9% increase in average premiums per auto policy over the past twelve months. The GEICO Giveback program provided a 15% premium credit to all new and renewal voluntary auto and motorcycle policies written between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Over that six-month period, the GEICO Giveback program reduced premiums written by approximately $2.9 billion. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 183,000 during the first six months of 2021. Premiums earned increased $506 million (5.6%) in the second quarter and $320 million (1.8%) in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. Premiums earned in the first six months of 2021 included reductions of approximately $460 million attributable to the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback premium credit. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $2.0 billion (35.7%) in the second quarter and $1.7 billion (13.7%) in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned increased 17.7 percentage points in the second quarter and 8.0 percentage points in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The increases reflected overall increases in average claims frequencies and severities, partially offset by increased reductions of claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events. Claims frequencies in the first six months of 2021 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (eleven to twelve percent range), bodily injury (thirteen to fourteen percent range), personal injury (sixteen to seventeen percent range) and collision (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range). Average claims severities in the first six months of 2021 were higher for property damage coverage (two to three percent range), collision coverage (ten to eleven percent range) and bodily injury coverage (ten to thirteen percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses included reductions in the ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events of $846 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to $166 million in 2020. Underwriting expenses were relatively flat in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting higher advertising and technology costs, offset by lower travel and employee-related expenses and provisions for uncollectible premiums. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) in the first six months of 2021 was relatively unchanged compared to 2020. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients.

BH Specialty premiums written increased 44% for the second quarter and 43% for the first six months, primarily attributable to increases in professional liability, casualty and property lines of business. MedPro Group premiums increased 45% for the second quarter and 31% for the first six months of 2021, attributable to increased volume across its product categories. Commercial auto volumes at NICO Primary and BHHC also increased during the second quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. USLI premiums written increased 27% in the second quarter and 20% in the first six months, attributable to increases in its retail and wholesale customer bases. BH Primary’s workers’ compensation business continues to experience increased price competition in the market. 26 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) BH Primary’s loss ratio was relatively unchanged in the second quarter and declined 3.3 percentage points in the first six months of 2021 versus 2020. The year-to-date decline reflected net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $253 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to $84 million in the first six months of 2020. Estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the first six months of 2021 from the major winter storm in North America (“Winter Storm Uri”) were $156 million. Incurred losses attributable to the pandemic were approximately $180 million in the first six months of 2020. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation business and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future, attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Underwriting expenses in the second quarter and first six months of 2021 increased 12.0% and 6.6%, respectively, compared to 2020. The expense ratio declined 2.2 percentage points in the first six months of 2021, reflecting changes in business mix, improved leverage on internal underwriting expenses at BH Specialty and the impact of pandemic-related allowances for expected credit losses recorded in the first six months of 2020. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also offer life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN. Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) Premiums written increased 14.4% in the second quarter and 10.8% in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The increases reflected net new business, increased participations on renewals, improved pricing and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased 10.9% in the second quarter and were relatively unchanged in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. In 2021, the loss ratio decreased 26.7 percentage points in the second quarter and 16.8 percentage points in the first six months compared to 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months of 2021 included estimated losses from Winter Storm Uri of $418 million and a net increase in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $35 million. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months of 2020 included a net increase in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $439 million, primarily attributable to an increase in legacy environmental, asbestos and other latent injury liabilities recorded in the second quarter. In 2020, losses and loss adjustment expenses also included approximately $350 million in the second quarter and $575 million in the first six months attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. The expense ratio in 2021 decreased 3.0 percentage points in the second quarter and 3.5 percentage points in the first six months compared to the same periods in 2020, attributable to changes in business mix and the impact of pandemic-related charges in the 2020 periods. Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2021 2020 2021 2020 Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 1,296 $ 1,418 $ 2,597 $ 2,770 Premiums earned $ 1,299 100.0 $ 1,418 100.0 $ 2,604 100.0 $ 2,769 100.0 Life and health insurance benefits 1,235 95.1 1,132 79.8 2,486 95.5 2,186 78.9 Underwriting expenses 233 17.9 245 17.3 459 17.6 537 19.4 Total benefits and expenses 1,468 113.0 1,377 97.1 2,945 113.1 2,723 98.3 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ (169 ) $ 41 $ (341 ) $ 46 Life/health premiums written decreased 8.6% in the second quarter and 6.2% in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. The decreases reflected the non-renewal in 2021 of a policy that covered U.S. health insurance risks ($198 million in the second quarter and $366 million in the first six months), partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation effects. Underwriting earnings in the first six months of 2021 were negatively affected by significant increases in mortality in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America, which were partially offset by lower underwriting expenses, due mainly to lower average commission rates in the international life business. Underwriting results in the first six months of 2020 included pre-tax earnings from international life business, partially offset by pre-tax losses from U.S. life business, the run-off of long-term care business and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Retroactive reinsurance Pre-tax underwriting losses in each period derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Before foreign currency exchange effects, pre-tax underwriting losses were $220 million in the second quarter and $463 million in the first six months of 2021. In 2020, before foreign currency exchange effects, pre-tax underwriting losses were $345 million in the second quarter and $592 million in the first six months. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses were insignificant in 2021 compared to losses of $115 million in the second quarter and gains of $90 million in the first six months of 2020. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $40.2 billion at June 30, 2021, declining $729 million since December 31, 2020, primarily due to loss payments. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were $12.0 billion at June 30, 2021, a decline of $473 million since December 31, 2020, primarily attributable to amortization. Deferred charge assets will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization. 28 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned declined 32.4% in the second quarter and 21.7% in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive. Estimates of periodic payment annuity industry volumes for the first six months of 2021 suggest that overall market volume is down roughly 30% compared to the same period in 2020 due to a decline in claim settlements this year attributed to the impact of pandemic conditions on the court systems. The volumes written also change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include the effects of mortality, interest rate changes that may affect expected settlements under certain contracts and gains or losses from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency exchange losses of $10 million in the second quarter and $20 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to gains of $6 million in the second quarter and $111 million in the first six months of 2020. Excluding foreign currency exchange gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses were $134 million in the second quarter and $260 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to $152 million in the second quarter and $313 million in the first six months of 2020, which primarily derived from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Pre-tax losses in the first six months of 2021 were partially offset by the effects of higher mortality and interest rates. Discounted annuity liabilities were $14.6 billion at June 30, 2021, reflecting a weighted average discount rate of approximately 4.0%. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $4 million in the second quarter and $125 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to earnings of $105 million in the second quarter and losses of $129 million in the first six months of 2020. The results from these contracts reflect changes in our estimated liabilities for underlying guaranteed benefits, which are affected by changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting results from these contracts are volatile, reflecting the volatility of securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Underwriting earnings in the first six months of 2021 were primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate changes and, to a lesser extent, changes in securities markets. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months Percentage Change 2021 2020 2021 2020 Second Quarter First Six Months Interest and other investment income $ 158 $ 270 $ 317 $ 674 (41.5 )% (53.0 )% Dividend income 1,298 1,343 2,551 2,586 (3.4 ) (1.4 ) Pre-tax net investment income 1,456 1,613 2,868 3,260 (9.7 ) (12.0 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 237 245 441 506 Net investment income $ 1,219 $ 1,368 $ 2,427 $ 2,754 Effective income tax rate 16.3 % 15.1 % 15.4 % 15.5 % Interest and other investment income declined 41.5% in the second quarter and 53.0% in the first six months of 2021 compared to same periods in 2020, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills. We expect that the current historically low short-term interest rates will negatively affect our comparative earnings from such investments for the remainder of 2021. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $142 billion at June 30, 2021 and $138 billion at December 31, 2020. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first six months of 2021 and 2020, and consequently, the average cost of float for each period was negative. 29 Item 2.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) The following table summarizes BNSF’s railroad freight volumes by business group (cars/units in thousands). Cars/Units Second Quarter First Six Months Percentage Change 2021 2020 2021 2020 Second Quarter First Six Months Consumer products 1,489 1,169 2,882 2,376 27.4 % 21.3 % Industrial products 438 370 837 830 18.4 0.8 Agricultural products 313 277 631 562 13.0 12.3 Coal 384 292 723 676 31.5 7.0 2,624 2,108 5,073 4,444 24.5 14.2 Railroad operating revenues increased 26.0% in the second quarter and 11.7% in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. Railroad operating revenues in 2021 reflected higher volumes of 24.5% in the second quarter and 14.2% in the first six months, partially offset by a 2.2% year-to-date decrease in average revenue per car/unit resulting from business mix changes. Pre-tax earnings were $2.0 billion and $3.6 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2021, increases of 32.5% and 18.2%, respectively, compared to the corresponding 2020 periods. The increases were attributable to the increased volumes and improved productivity. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant economic slowdown that adversely affected our volumes in 2020. Operating revenues from consumer products were $2.1 billion in the second quarter and $4.0 billion in the first six months of 2021, increases of 32.6% and 19.1%, respectively, from 2020. Volumes increased 27.4% in the second quarter and 21.3% in the first six months of 2021, with a higher average revenue per car/unit in the second quarter and a lower average revenue per car/unit in the first six months of 2021. The volume increases resulted from growth in intermodal in both international and domestic shipments driven by increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and increased e-commerce activity, as well as from growth in automotive shipments. Operating revenues from industrial products increased 16.6% in the second quarter to $1.4 billion and decreased 1.8% to $2.6 billion in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The decrease for the first six months was attributable to lower average revenue per car/unit due to commodity mix and lower fuel surcharge revenue. Average revenue per car/unit was also lower in the second quarter. Volumes increased 18.4% in the second quarter and 0.8% in the first six months, primarily due to continued recovery in the U.S. industrial economy, driving higher volumes in the construction and building sectors, partially offset by lower petroleum volumes due to reduced production and demand in the energy sector. Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.3 billion in the second quarter and $2.6 billion in the first six months of 2021, increases of 18.7% and 16.4%, respectively, from 2020. Volumes increased 13.0% in the second quarter and 12.3% in the first six months of 2021 as compared to 2020. The volume increases were primarily due to higher grain exports, as well as higher volumes of ethanol and related commodities. Revenue per car/unit also increased for both periods of 2021. Operating revenues from coal were $767 million in the second quarter and $1.5 billion in the first six months of 2021, increases of 41.8% and 11.2%, respectively, from 2020, attributable to higher volumes of 31.5% in the second quarter and 7.0% in the first six months, as well as from higher average revenue per car/unit. Volume increases in 2021 were attributable to increased electricity generation and higher natural gas prices and from utilities rebuilding inventory in the second quarter after draw-downs earlier in the year. Railroad operating expenses were $3.4 billion in the second quarter and $6.7 billion in the first six months of 2021, increases of $668 million (24.5%) and $577 million (9.4%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased 0.7 percentage points to 60.4% in the second quarter and 1.3 percentage points to 62.0% in the first six months of 2021 versus the 2020 periods. The increases in railroad operating expenses reflected higher volumes and higher average fuel prices, partially offset by productivity improvements. 31 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Compensation and benefits expenses increased $169 million (17.3%) in the second quarter and $108 million (4.9%) in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. The increases were primarily due to increased volumes, partially offset by productivity improvements. Fuel expenses increased $366 million (111.9%) in the second quarter and $302 million (32.1%) in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. The increases were primarily due to higher average fuel prices and higher volumes, partially offset by better fuel efficiency. Purchased service expenses increased $77 million (17.8%) in the second quarter and $65 million (6.8%) in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher volumes and the effects of insurance recoveries in 2020 related to 2019 flooding, partially offset by improved productivity. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $57 million (15.2%) in the second quarter and $98 million (11.9%) in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020, due to higher volume related costs and increased property and miscellaneous taxes. Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We currently own 91.1% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Three of the natural gas pipeline systems were acquired on November 1, 2020 from Dominion Energy, Inc. (“BHE GT&S acquisition”). Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2021 2020 2021 2020 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 4,301 $ 3,419 $ 9,150 $ 7,053 Real estate operating revenue 1,763 1,193 2,995 2,086 Other income (loss) 21 47 (136 ) 27 Total revenue 6,085 4,659 12,009 9,166 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 1,110 888 2,679 1,926 Energy operating expense 2,134 1,638 4,170 3,349 Real estate operating costs and expense 1,584 1,116 2,704 1,989 Interest expense 518 484 1,034 950 Total costs and expense 5,346 4,126 10,587 8,214 Pre-tax earnings 739 533 1,422 952 Income tax expense (benefit)* (212 ) (165 ) (444 ) (366 ) Net earnings after income taxes 951 698 1,866 1,318 Noncontrolling interests 102 4 208 7 Net earnings attributable to BHE 849 694 1,658 1,311 Noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends 109 61 215 117 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 740 $ 633 $ 1,443 $ 1,194 Effective income tax rate (28.7 )% (31.0 )% (31.2 )% (38.4 )% * Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation. 32 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) The discussion of BHE’s operating results that follows is based on after-tax earnings, reflecting how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated. A summary of net earnings attributable to BHE follows (in millions).

PacifiCorp after-tax earnings increased $59 million in the second quarter and $52 million in the first six months of 2021 as compared to 2020. These increases reflected higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and increased income tax benefits from the impacts of ratemaking as well as higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. The earnings increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses, including increased depreciation expense from the impacts of a deprecation study effective January 1, 2021, and lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction. PacifiCorp’s utility margin was $857 million in the second quarter and $1.7 billion in the first six months of 2021, increases of $96 million and $125 million, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2020. These increases reflected higher retail revenue from a 5.7% year-to-date increase in customer volumes and higher wholesale and other revenue, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. Retail customer volumes increased due to higher customer usage, the favorable impacts of weather and an increase in the average number of customers. MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased $3 million in the second quarter and decreased $3 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. These changes reflected higher electric utility margin and increased income tax benefits, as well as higher operating expenses. The increases in operating expenses included incremental costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, as well as higher electric and natural gas distribution costs. The income tax benefit increases were mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized from higher wind-powered generation, driven primarily by new wind projects placed in-service, partially offset by the impacts of ratemaking. MEC’s electric utility margin was $483 million in the second quarter and $877 million in the first six months of 2021, increases of 8% and 5%, respectively, versus 2020. These increases were attributable to higher operating revenue from wholesale and retail customer volumes, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes increased 9.2% in the second quarter and 7.0% in the first six months of 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to increased usage by certain industrial customers and the favorable impacts of weather. NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings increased $2 million in the second quarter and $16 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. These increases reflected lower interest expense and lower income tax expense from the impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by lower electric utility margin and higher operating expenses. The increases in operating expenses were mainly due to higher depreciation expense from additional plant placed in-service, partially offset by lower plant operations and maintenance costs. NV Energy’s electric utility margin was $402 million in the second quarter and $707 million in the first six months of 2021, decreases of 1% and 3%, respectively, compared to 2020. These decreases were primarily due to lower operating revenue from lower base tariff general rates at Nevada Power Company, partially offset by a 4.4% increase in electric retail customer volumes for the first six months of 2021, price impacts from changes in sales mix and an increase in the average number of customers. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to the impacts from COVID-19 recovery and the favorable impacts of weather. 33 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings decreased $84 million in the second quarter and $67 million in the first six months of 2021 as compared to 2020. Earnings in each period of 2021 included deferred income tax expense of $109 million related to the enactment in the second quarter of an increase in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. The earnings decreases were partially offset by higher distribution revenue, mainly from increased tariff rates and units distributed and from favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2021. Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $36 million in the second quarter and $240 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 from BHE GT&S were $66 million in the second quarter and $173 million in the first six months. In addition, year-to-date earnings increased from the effects of higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas, largely due to the favorable impacts on demand from the February 2021 winter storms. Other energy businesses after-tax earnings increased $45 million in the second quarter and decreased $29 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. The second quarter earnings increase was primarily due to income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation, and higher operating revenue from owned solar projects. The decrease in year-to-date earnings was primarily due to a decline in wind tax equity investment earnings of $58 million, partially offset by higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects. The decrease in wind tax equity investment earnings was primarily due to increased losses from preexisting tax equity investments of $134 million, largely attributable to the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $76 million in the second quarter and $150 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. The increases reflected significantly higher earnings from brokerage and mortgage services. The increases in earnings from brokerage services were due to a comparative increase in closed transaction volumes in 2021 and the earnings increases from mortgage services were attributable to an unfavorable 2020 contingent earn-out remeasurement and higher year-to-date funded mortgage volume in 2021. Corporate interest and other after-tax losses decreased $18 million in the second quarter and increased $12 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting increased operating expenses and higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2020, as well as higher federal income tax credits recognized and higher earnings from non-regulated energy services. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months Percentage Change 2021 2020 2021 2020 Second Quarter First Six Months Revenues Manufacturing $ 17,412 $ 13,033 $ 33,325 $ 28,068 33.6 % 18.7 % Service and retailing 21,272 17,255 40,852 36,032 23.3 13.4 $ 38,684 $ 30,288 $ 74,177 $ 64,100 Pre-tax earnings* Manufacturing $ 2,714 $ 1,399 $ 5,150 $ 3,510 94.0 % 46.7 % Service and retailing 1,270 452 2,311 1,075 181.0 115.0 3,984 1,851 7,461 4,585 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 980 402 1,838 1,098 $ 3,004 $ 1,449 $ 5,623 $ 3,487 Effective income tax rate 24.1 % 21.5 % 24.1 % 23.6 % Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues 10.3 % 6.1 % 10.1 % 7.2 % * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which were primarily from the amortization of identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings in the preceding table were $183 million in the second quarter and $363 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to $196 million in the second quarter and $398 million in the first six months of 2020. In the second quarter and first six months of 2020, such expenses also exclude goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset after-tax impairment charges of $10.35 billion. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page 24 and in the “Other” earnings section on page 40. 34 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2021 2020 2021 2020 Revenues Industrial products $ 7,186 $ 5,789 $ 13,858 $ 13,147 Building products 6,402 4,968 12,030 9,825 Consumer products 3,824 2,276 7,437 5,096 $ 17,412 $ 13,033 $ 33,325 $ 28,068 Pre-tax earnings Industrial products $ 1,242 $ 535 $ 2,384 $ 1,841 Building products 973 696 1,743 1,263 Consumer products 499 168 1,023 406 $ 2,714 $ 1,399 $ 5,150 $ 3,510 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Industrial products 17.3 % 9.2 % 17.2 % 14.0 % Building products 15.2 % 14.0 % 14.5 % 12.9 % Consumer products 13.0 % 7.4 % 13.8 % 8.0 % Industrial products The industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, including equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries, which are internally aggregated into sectors (or “groups”). The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Revenues of the industrial products group in 2021 increased $1.4 billion (24.1%) from the second quarter and $711 million (5.4%) over the first six months of 2020. Pre-tax earnings in 2021 increased $707 million (132%) from the second quarter and $543 million (29.5%) from the first six months of 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 17.2% for the first six months of 2021 compared to 14.0% in 2020. Results in 2020 were more significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. PCC’s revenues were $1.6 billion in the second quarter and $3.2 billion in the first six months of 2021, decreases of $156 million (8.8%) and $1.0 billion (24.7%), respectively, compared to 2020. Historically, PCC has derived significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and aircraft production in 2020. While air travel in the U.S. is increasing in 2021, we do not expect significant increases in PCC’s aerospace demand to occur in the near term due to the inventory levels currently within the industry supply chain. Consequently, we anticipate PCC’s revenues and earnings in 2021 will be below pre-pandemic levels. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased $361 million in the second quarter and $228 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. The increases reflect the aggressive actions taken by management to resize and restructure operations. Lubrizol’s revenues were approximately $1.7 billion in the second quarter and $3.35 billion in the first six months of 2021, increases of 28.0% in the second quarter and 15.3% in the first six months compared to 2020. The increases were attributable to higher volumes and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Despite an increase in sales and volume compared to the prior year, the Additives product line was affected by severe winter storms in February 2021, which caused the temporary shut-down of several U.S. facilities and negatively impacted sales. 35 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings decreased 17.4% in the second quarter and 15.0% in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. Earnings in the second quarter of 2021 included property losses, asset impairment charges and containment and response costs of approximately $160 million in connection with a fire at its Chemtool facility in Rockton, Illinois in June 2021. Earnings in 2021 were also negatively impacted by the weather-related temporary shut-down of Additives facilities in the U.S. in the first quarter due to lost sales and various incremental and non-recurring manufacturing and other operating costs. The comparative decline for the first six months was partially offset by increased earnings from the Advanced Materials business group. Marmon’s revenues were $2.5 billion in the second quarter and $4.6 billion in the first six months of 2021, increases of $809 million (47.6%) and $899 million (24.3%), respectively, compared to 2020. The revenue increases were primarily due to higher metal prices in the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups, higher volumes in most of Marmon’s business groups, particularly those serving the construction, automotive, heavy duty truck and trailer OEM markets and restaurant markets, and from favorable foreign currency translation effects. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues in the Rail & Leasing group from lower railcar repair volumes, leased fleet utilization, and lease renewal rates and from the impact of divestitures and business closures in the Water Technologies and Retail Solutions groups. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 increased $179 million (80.0%) in the second quarter and $162 million (30.9%) in the first six months compared to 2020. Earnings in the first six months of 2021 reflected higher earnings across most business groups, favorable currency translation effects and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Water Technologies groups. IMC’s revenues were $915 million in the second quarter and $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, increases of 43.6% in the second quarter and 21.7% in the first six months compared to 2020. Revenues in the first six months of 2021 reflected improving business conditions in most geographic regions and favorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 136.6% in the second quarter and 65.6% in the first six months of 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to the favorable effects of higher customer demand, which improved manufacturing efficiencies, and also from the effects of other operating cost management saving initiatives and foreign currency translation. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Revenues of the building products group increased $1.4 billion (28.9%) in the second quarter and $2.2 billion (22.4%) in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings increased $277 million (39.8%) in the second quarter and $480 million (38.0%) in the first six months over 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 14.5% in the first six months of 2021, an increase of 1.6 percentage points over 2020. Residential housing construction in the U.S. was strong during 2020 and these conditions continued through the first six months of 2021. However, the effects of strong demand and supply chain disruptions contributed to significant cost increases for key materials and products used by our businesses, including lumber, steel, copper, petrochemical-based materials, energy, freight and fixtures, necessitating higher sales prices. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $2.7 billion in the second quarter and $5.0 billion in the first six months of 2021, increases of $639 million (31.2%) and $1.2 billion (31.1%), respectively, compared to 2020. Revenues from home sales increased $1.1 billion (37%) in the first six months of 2021, reflecting a net increase in units sold, increased revenue per home sold and changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 38% in the first six months of 2021, while factory-built manufactured home unit sales increased 5%. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 13% in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $17.8 billion as of June 30, 2021, an increase of $738 million compared to December 31, 2020. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $456 million in the second quarter and $848 million in the first six months of 2021, increases of $138 million (43.1%) and $328 million (63.0%), respectively, compared to 2020. Earnings in the first six months of 2021 reflected higher earnings from home sales, mortgage originations, net interest income and a decline of $85 million in provisions for expected credit losses. The provisions for expected credit losses in the first six months of 2020 were unusually high and included provisions for the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 36 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $3.7 billion in the second quarter and $7.0 billion in the first six months of 2021, increases of 27.2% and 17.0%, respectively, versus 2020. The increases were primarily due to higher volumes for paint and coatings, residential flooring, engineered products and other building systems and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were $517 million in the second quarter and $895 million in the first six months of 2021, increases of 37.2% and 20.5%, respectively, over 2020. The increases were primarily attributable to the increases in revenues and ongoing operating cost control efforts, partly offset by cost increases related to the constrained supply and availability of certain products and materials and shipping and freight services, attributable to the ongoing effects of supply chain disruptions and the impact of severe winter storms in 2021. Consumer products The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). Consumer products revenues increased approximately $1.5 billion (68.0%) in the second quarter and $2.3 billion (45.9%) in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings increased $331 million (197%) in the second quarter and $617 million (152%) in the first six months of 2021 versus 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues increased 5.8 percentage points to 13.8% in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues in the first six months of 2021 increased significantly at several of our businesses that were severely impacted by the pandemic in the first half of 2020. Revenues from Forest River increased $1.3 billion (59%) in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020, driven by increased unit sales for recreational vehicles. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 46.6% in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting significant increases in unit sales, attributable in part to inventory restocking by certain customers, as well as from increased consumer demand. The comparative increases in pre-tax earnings were driven by the revenue increases from Forest River, Brooks Sports, Duracell and the apparel businesses, as well as lower inventory obsolescence allowances. Our consumer products businesses are also experiencing cost increases attributable to supply chain disruptions. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2021 2020 2021 2020 Revenues Service $ 3,982 $ 2,667 $ 7,587 $ 6,025 Retailing 4,995 3,370 9,348 6,968 McLane Company 12,295 11,218 23,917 23,039 $ 21,272 $ 17,255 $ 40,852 $ 36,032 Pre-tax earnings Service $ 727 $ 260 $ 1,317 $ 685 Retailing 459 148 807 281 McLane Company 84 44 187 109 $ 1,270 $ 452 $ 2,311 $ 1,075 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Service 18.3 % 9.7 % 17.4 % 11.4 % Retailing 9.2 % 4.4 % 8.6 % 4.0 % McLane Company 0.7 % 0.4 % 0.8 % 0.5 % 37 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service Our service business group offers shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI), franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen) and offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and the operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Service group revenues increased 49.3% in the second quarter and 25.9% in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings increased $467 million (179.6%) in the second quarter and $632 million (92.3%) in the first six months of 2021 versus 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 17.4% in the first six months of 2021, an increase of 6.0 percentage points compared to the first six months of 2020. Revenues from TTI increased 52.4% in the second quarter and 38.7% in the first six months of 2021 versus 2020. The increases reflected accelerating demand across all significant markets within the electronic components industry as industry participants attempt to maintain adequate inventories in response to high demand for components in end products and supply chain disruptions. Revenues from aviation services (NetJets and FlightSafety) increased 56.0% in the second quarter and 22.4% in the first six months of 2021 over low 2020 levels, primarily due to higher training hours and significantly higher customer flight hours. Earnings at most of our service businesses increased significantly in the second quarter and first six months of 2021 compared to 2020, with the largest increases from TTI and the aviation services businesses. The increases in the aggregate earnings from NetJets and FlightSafety were primarily attributable to improved operating margins from changes in business mix, increased operating efficiencies and the effects of past restructuring efforts. TTI’s earnings increases were primarily attributable to the increases in sales and improved operating cost leverage. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”), which consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA represents about 64% of our combined retailing revenues in 2021. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics and represent about 20% of the combined retailing revenues in 2021. Other retailing businesses also include three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories. Retailing group revenues increased approximately $1.6 billion (48.2%) in the second quarter and $2.4 billion (34.2%) in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings increased $311 million (210%) in the second quarter and $526 million (187%) in the first six months compared to 2020. Operating results of our retailing businesses were severely impacted by the pandemic beginning in March of 2020 and continuing through the second quarter of 2020. Over the second half of 2020 and continuing through the first six months of 2021, revenues and pre-tax earnings of these businesses increased, and in certain instances increased to levels exceeding those in pre-pandemic periods, despite ongoing supply chain disruptions. BHA’s revenues in the first six months of 2021 increased 29.4% from 2020, primarily due to a 30% increase in new and pre-owned vehicle sales, mainly attributable to higher volumes of new auto sales. Home furnishings group revenues increased $523 million (38.0%) in the first six months of 2021 over 2020, while aggregate revenues of our other retailing operations increased 51.2% versus 2020. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased $143 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increases in vehicle gross sales margins, higher service margins and earnings from finance and service contract activities as well as from lower floorplan interest expense, primarily attributable to lower inventory levels, and operating cost control efforts. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $383 million in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020, due to the restricted operations at many of those businesses during the second quarter of 2020 arising from the initial effects of the pandemic. Results in 2021 also benefitted from strong consumer demand and the effects of restructuring efforts. 38 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales typically comprise about two-thirds of McLane’s consolidated sales with foodservice comprising much of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. The grocery and foodservice businesses continue to operate in an intensely competitive business environment. Revenues increased $1.1 billion (9.6%) in the second quarter and $878 million (3.8%) in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues from the grocery business were relatively unchanged in the first six months of 2021, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 9.9% and 21.7%, respectively, compared to the first six months of 2020. The foodservice business was negatively impacted by pandemic-related restaurant closures in 2020. Pre-tax earnings increased $40 million (90.9%) in the second quarter and $78 million (71.6%) in the first six months of 2021 versus 2020. The increases in earnings primarily reflected higher earnings from the foodservice and beverage businesses, ongoing cost management efforts and the effects of expected credit losses and inventory valuation losses of $23 million recorded in the first six months of 2020. Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains/losses follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2021 2020 2021 2020 Investment gains/losses $ 27,173 $ 39,289 $ 32,384 $ (29,593 ) Derivative gains/losses 221 796 710 (597 ) Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 27,394 40,085 33,094 (30,190 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 5,986 8,440 6,993 (6,218 ) Net gains/losses $ 21,408 $ 31,645 $ 26,101 $ (23,972 ) Effective income tax rate 21.4 % 21.0 % 20.9 % 20.7 % Investment gains/losses Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains/losses included net unrealized gains of $27.0 billion in the second quarter and $31.5 billion in the first six months of 2021 compared to net unrealized gains of $39.4 billion in the second quarter and net unrealized losses of $18.4 billion in the first six months of 2020 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Investment losses on equity securities sold in the first six months of 2020 were $11.2 billion, which included losses of $10.7 billion from market value changes in the first quarter on securities that were sold in the second quarter. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold, which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $228 million in the second quarter and $2.0 billion in the first six months of 2021. Taxable investment losses on equity securities were $4.5 billion in the second quarter and $3.3 billion in the first six months of 2020. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant due to the volatility of market prices in the underlying equity markets. As of June 30, 2021, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was $72 million and our recorded liability at fair value was $355 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under these contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. 39 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2021 2020 2021 2020 Equity method earnings $ 141 $ (154 ) $ 355 $ 102 Acquisition accounting expenses (183 ) (196 ) (363 ) (398 ) Goodwill and intangible asset impairments — (10,350 ) — (10,350 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (77 ) (76 ) (157 ) (172 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes (45 ) (92 ) 480 83 Other (5 ) 131 (11 ) 331 $ (169 ) $ (10,737 ) $ 304 $ (10,404 ) After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. Our after-tax earnings from Kraft Heinz were $20 million for the second quarter and $155 million for the first six months of 2021. Our Kraft Heinz investment produced after-tax losses of $297 million for the second quarter and $198 million for the first six months of 2020, which included after-tax losses of $513 million in the second quarter and $552 million in the first six months associated with goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 included $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at June 30, 2021 was $470 billion, an increase of $27.2 billion since December 31, 2020. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders were $39.8 billion in the first six months of 2021 and included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $25.5 billion. Changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities can produce significant volatility in our earnings. At June 30, 2021, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $140.7 billion, which included $118.1 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $328.4 billion. Berkshire parent company outstanding debt at June 30, 2021 was $22.5 billion, a decrease of $190 million since December 31, 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, Berkshire repaid €550 million and $1.0 billion of maturing senior notes and issued €600 million of 0.5% senior notes due in 2041. In April 2021, Berkshire issued ¥160 billion (approximately $1.5 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2041 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. Berkshire parent company debt maturing over the next twelve months is $1.1 billion. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $18.1 billion at June 30, 2021, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $13.1 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In January 2021, BHFC repaid $750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $750 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2051. BHFC debt maturing over the next twelve months is $775 million. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. 40 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition (Continued) Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of these two operations in the first six months of 2021 were $4.1 billion and we currently forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $6.2 billion over the remainder of 2021. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.3 billion as of June 30, 2021, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2020. During the first six months of 2021, BNSF repaid $886 million of debt and issued $925 million of 3.3% debentures due in 2051. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $51.4 billion at June 30, 2021, a decrease of $744 million since December 31, 2020. During the first six months of 2021, BHE and its subsidiaries repaid $1.7 billion of term debt, issued $550 million of 3.4% term debt due in 2051 and increased short-term borrowings by $250 million. In July 2021, BHE subsidiaries issued $1.5 billion of term debt due in 2052 with interest rates ranging from 2.7% to 2.9%. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $1.5 billion. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $12.6 billion in the first six months of 2021 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future are not currently reflected in the financial statements, which will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events and the actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the first six months of 2021, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $4.4 billion in the aggregate. Principal and interest payments associated with these borrowings are expected as follows: in 2021 – $38 million; in 2022 through 2025 – $79 million per annum; and thereafter – $6.2 billion. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2021 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in the “Contractual Obligations” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2021 includes estimated liabilities of $123.2 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. 41 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2021 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.8 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2020. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. As of June 30, 2021, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently anticipate, and we may need to record goodwill or indefinite-lived asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units and judgments on goodwill impairments at this time are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on a reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. As of the most recent annual goodwill impairment review conducted during the fourth quarter of 2020, the estimated fair values of certain reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $35.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $32.1 billion by 10.6%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the four other reporting units where estimated fair value did not exceed carrying value by at least 20%, their aggregate estimated fair value of approximately $1.5 billion exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $1.4 billion by 10.0%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $600 million. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. 42 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of June 30, 2021, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. 43 Part II Other Information Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the second quarter of 2021 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program April Class A common stock 611 $ 408,470.13 611 * Class B common stock 5,795,788 $ 267.75 5,795,788 * May Class A common stock 689 $ 432,536.24 689 * Class B common stock 1,872,026 $ 286.10 1,872,026 * June Class A common stock 2,250 $ 432,132.04 2,250 * Class B common stock 8,646,680 $ 279.94 8,646,680 * * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $30 billion.

General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, changes in the fair values of certain derivative contract liabilities, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the magnitude of asset impairment charges can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread rapidly across the world in 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in March of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has since adversely affected nearly all of our operations, although the effects are varying significantly. The extent of the effects over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The risks and uncertainties resulting from the pandemic that may affect our future earnings, cash flows and financial condition include the time to vaccinate a significant number of people in the U.S. and throughout the world as well as the long-term effect from the pandemic on the demand for certain of our products and services. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2. New accounting pronouncements We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January 1, 2020 . ASC 326 provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried at amortized cost based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses therefore include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a charge to retained earnings of $ 388 million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses, which was primarily related to our manufactured housing loans. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts.” ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used to value policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts, with the effects of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount rate assumptions reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 7 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.

The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8 % per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends or is mandatorily redeemable under specified events. Dividends on the preferred stock may be paid in cash or, at Occidental’s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 325,442,152 shares of Kraft Heinz common stock representing 26.6 % of the outstanding shares. We recorded equity method earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz of $ 150 million in the first quarter of 2021 and $ 101 million in 2020. We received dividends on the common stock of $ 130 million in each of the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, which were recorded as reductions to the carrying value of our investment. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $ 13.0 billion at March 31, 2021 and $ 11.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $ 13.4 billion at March 31, 2021 and $ 13.3 billion at December 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investment in Kraft Heinz exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by $ 362 million ( 2.7 % of carrying value). Summarized consolidated financial information of Kraft Heinz follows (in millions). March 27, 2021 December 26, 2020 Assets $ 98,664 $ 99,830 Liabilities 48,233 49,587 First Quarter 2021 2020 Sales $ 6,394 $ 6,157 Net earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz common shareholders 563 378 Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”) and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”). The carrying value of our investments in these entities was approximately $ 3.1 billion as of March 31, 2021 and $ 4.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. Our equity method earnings from these entities in the first quarter were $ 101 million in 2021 and $ 199 million in 2020. During the first quarter of 2021, we received distributions from these other investees of $ 896 million, including a non-recurring distribution received from Pilot of $ 849 million. Additional information concerning these investments follows. We own a 50 % interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50 % interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through commercial paper, which was $ 1.47 billion at March 31, 2021 and limited to $ 1.5 billion. Berkadia’s commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. A Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company subsidiary owns a 50 % interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint. American Electric Power owns the other 50 % interest. In 2017, we acquired a 38.6 % interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North America through more than 950 retail locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces and through wholesale distribution. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1 % interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining 11.3 % interest. We also entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4 % interest in Pilot in 2023, with the Haslam family retaining a 20 % interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023. 9 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 6. Investment and derivative contract gains/losses Investment and derivative contract gains/losses in the first quarter of 2021 and 2020 are summarized as follows (in millions). First Quarter 2021 2020 Investment gains (losses): Equity securities: Change in unrealized investment gains (losses) during the period on securities held at the end of the period $ 4,630 $ ( 68,482 ) Investment gains (losses) on securities sold during the period 430 ( 410 ) 5,060 ( 68,892 ) Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains 20 16 Gross realized losses ( 1 ) ( 6 ) Other 132 — Investment gains (losses) 5,211 ( 68,882 ) Derivative contract gains (losses) 489 ( 1,393 ) $ 5,700 $ ( 70,275 ) Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the period. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $ 6.5 billion in the first three months of 2021 and $ 2.2 billion in the first three months of 2020. In the preceding table, investment gains/losses on equity securities sold during the period reflect the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable quarterly period or, if later, the purchase date. Our taxable gains/losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Taxable gains in the first quarter of 2021 and 2020 were $ 1.8 billion and $ 1.2 billion, respectively. The derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. Information related to these contracts follows (dollars in millions). March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Balance sheet liabilities - at fair value $ 577 $ 1,065 Notional value 9,721 10,991 Intrinsic value 211 727 Weighted average remaining life (in years) 1.0 1.2 Notional value in the preceding table represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming the value of each index is zero at each contract’s expiration date. Intrinsic value is the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Substantially all open contracts as of March 31, 2021 will expire by February 2023 . Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike price at the contract expiration date. We received aggregate premiums of $ 1.9 billion on the contract inception dates with respect to unexpired contracts as of March 31, 2021 and we have no counterparty credit risk. Note 7. Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are summarized as follows (in millions).

The outstanding loan under the facility was approximately $ 1.6 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and is secured by mortgages on real estate properties. In the first quarter of 2020, we provided a loan to Lee Enterprises, Inc. in connection with its acquisition of our newspaper operations and the repayment of its then outstanding credit facilities. The loan balance was $ 499 million as of March 31, 2021 and $ 524 million at December 31, 2020.

Goodwill and other intangible assets (Continued) Intangible asset amortization expense in the first quarter was $ 319 million in 2021 and $ 325 million in 2020. Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $ 18.3 billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. During 2020, we concluded it was necessary to reevaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of certain of our reporting units for impairment due to the disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of approximately $ 10 billion and pre-tax indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $ 638 million in the second quarter of 2020. Approximately $ 10 billion of these charges related to Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), the largest business within Berkshire's manufacturing segment. The carrying value of PCC-related goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets prior to the impairment charges was approximately $ 31 billion. Note 13. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 14), for each of the three months ending March 31, 2021 and 2020 follows (in millions). 2021 2020 Balances at beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 79,854 $ 73,019 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 2,912 ) ( 2,855 ) Net liabilities 76,942 70,164 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events 11,363 10,896 Prior accident years’ events ( 646 ) ( 200 ) Total 10,717 10,696 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events ( 3,214 ) ( 3,175 ) Prior accident years’ events ( 6,454 ) ( 6,841 ) Total ( 9,668 ) ( 10,016 ) Foreign currency translation adjustment ( 94 ) ( 372 ) Balances at March 31: Net liabilities 77,897 70,472 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 3,064 2,890 Gross liabilities $ 80,961 $ 73,362 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 646 million in 2021 and $ 200 million in 2020, which produced corresponding decreases in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 0.8 % in 2021 and 0.3 % in 2020. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to primary insurance were reduced by $ 699 million in the first quarter of 2021 and $ 172 million in 2020. The decreases in each period were primarily attributable to private passenger automobile and medical professional liability claims. The decrease in 2021 also reflected lower than anticipated workers’ compensation claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to reinsurance assumed increased $ 53 million in 2021 and decreased $ 28 million in 2020. 14 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the three months ending March 31, 2021 and 2020 follow (in millions). 2021 2020 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Balances at beginning of year $ 40,966 $ ( 12,441 ) $ 42,441 $ ( 13,747 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current year contracts — — — — Prior years’ contracts ( 5 ) 252 24 259 Total ( 5 ) 252 24 259 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 276 ) — ( 196 ) — Balances at March 31 $ 40,685 $ ( 12,189 ) $ 42,269 $ ( 13,488 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 247 $ 283 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflects when our exposure to losses begins. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter were $ 247 million in 2021 and $ 283 million in 2020, which consisted of recurring amortization of deferred changes and the effects of changes in the expected timing and amount of future loss payments. Berkshire’s subsidiary, National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), is party to a contract with certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”), in which NICO’s ultimate liability is contractually limited to $ 20 billion. Our estimated claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $ 17.5 billion at March 31, 2021 and $ 17.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Deferred charge assets related to the AIG contract were approximately $ 5.2 billion at March 31, 2021 and $ 5.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Note 15. Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of March 31, 2021. Weighted Average Interest Rate March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Insurance and other: Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) In the first quarter of 2021, Berkshire repaid € 550 million and $ 1.0 billion of maturing senior notes and issued € 600 million of 0.5 % senior notes due in 2041 . Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In January 2021, BHFC repaid $ 750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $ 750 million of 2.5 % senior notes due in 2051 . The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 6.9 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 625.5 billion par at March 31, 2021) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $ 720 million in the first quarter of 2021 and $ 228 million in the first quarter of 2020. In addition to BHFC borrowings, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $ 1.1 billion of other subsidiary borrowings at March 31, 2021. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. Weighted Average Interest Rate March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2023 - 2051 4.3 % $ 12,999 $ 13,447 Subsidiary and other debt due 2021 - 2064 4.1 % 36,461 36,420 Short-term borrowings 1.4 % 2,699 2,286 Burlington Northern Santa Fe (""BNSF"") and subsidiaries due 2021 - 2097 4.6 % 22,816 23,220 $ 74,975 $ 75,373 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In the first quarter of 2021, BHE and its subsidiaries repaid $ 476 million of term debt and increased short-term borrowings. BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. During the first quarter of 2021, BNSF repaid $ 407 million of debt. As of March 31, 2021, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2021, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $ 9.3 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included approximately $ 7.9 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 16 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16. Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, other receivables and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of their fair values.

Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 follow (in millions). Gains (losses) included in: Balance at beginning of year Earnings Regulatory assets and liabilities Acquisitions, dispositions and settlements Balance at March 31 Investments in equity securities: 2021 $ 8,978 $ 823 $ — $ 600 $ 10,401 2020 10,405 ( 4,861 ) — — 5,544 Equity index put option contract liabilities: 2021 ( 1,065 ) 489 — ( 1 ) ( 577 ) 2020 ( 968 ) ( 1,393 ) — — ( 2,361 ) Quantitative information as of March 31, 2021 with respect to significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follows (dollars in millions).

These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. 18 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16. Fair value measurements (Continued) Our equity index put option derivative contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. We determine the fair value of the equity index put option contract liabilities based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Note 17. Common stock Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the first quarter of 2021 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Class A, $ 5 Par Value ( 1,650,000 shares authorized) Class B, $ 0.0033 Par Value ( 3,225,000,000 shares authorized) Issued Treasury Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding Balances at December 31, 2020 678,523 ( 34,592 ) 643,931 1,469,359,852 ( 119,316,381 ) 1,350,043,471 Conversions of Class A to Class B common stock ( 896 ) — ( 896 ) 1,344,000 — 1,344,000 Treasury stock acquired — ( 4,606 ) ( 4,606 ) — ( 20,547,740 ) ( 20,547,740 ) Balances at March 31, 2021 677,627 ( 39,198 ) 638,429 1,470,703,852 ( 139,864,121 ) 1,330,839,731 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,525,655 shares outstanding as of March 31, 2021 and 1,543,960 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $ 20 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note 18. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 18.5 % in 2021 and 21.2 % in 2020. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, the magnitude of gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. 19 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. On November 1, 2020 , Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) acquired a large portion of the natural gas transmission and storage business of Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) for approximately $ 2.5 billion. The acquisition included a partial ownership of a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“Cove Point”), consisting of 100 % of the general partnership interest and 25 % of the limited partnership interests. We treat Cove Point as a consolidated subsidiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits which could be significant to Cove Point. As of the acquisition date, the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired was $ 13.4 billion, including residual goodwill of $ 1.7 billion, and the fair value of the liabilities assumed was $ 6.9 billion, including the assumption of approximately $ 5.6 billion of debt. We also recorded noncontrolling interests of $ 3.9 billion attributable to limited partnership interests in Cove Point that are held by third parties. BHE has also agreed to acquire certain other of Dominion’s pipeline business for approximately $ 1.3 billion. The closing of this second acquisition is subject to receiving necessary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2021. 20 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 22. Revenues from contracts with customers We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020 (in millions). Other revenues included in consolidated revenues were primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. Revenues and earnings before income taxes by segment for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions). First Quarter 2021 2020 Revenues of Operating Businesses Insurance: Underwriting: GEICO $ 8,923 $ 9,109 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 2,654 2,369 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 4,847 4,270 Investment income 1,414 1,648 Total insurance 17,838 17,396 BNSF 5,401 5,417 Berkshire Hathaway Energy 5,924 4,507 Manufacturing 15,913 15,035 McLane Company 11,622 11,821 Service and retailing 7,958 6,956 64,656 61,132 Reconciliation of segments to consolidated amount Corporate, eliminations and other ( 57 ) 133 $ 64,599 $ 61,265 First Quarter 2021 2020 Earnings (Loss) Before Income Taxes of Operating Businesses Insurance: Underwriting: GEICO $ 1,023 $ 984 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 206 ( 33 ) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group ( 263 ) ( 489 ) Investment income 1,412 1,647 Total insurance 2,378 2,109 BNSF 1,659 1,584 Berkshire Hathaway Energy 683 419 Manufacturing 2,436 2,111 McLane Company 103 65 Service and retailing 938 558 8,197 6,846 Reconciliation of segments to consolidated amount Investment and derivative gains/losses 5,700 ( 70,275 ) Interest expense, not allocated to segments ( 114 ) ( 136 ) Equity method investments 251 300 Corporate, eliminations and other 494 216 $ 14,528 $ ( 63,049 ) 22 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings/loss attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions). First Quarter 2021 2020 Insurance – underwriting $ 764 $ 363 Insurance – investment income 1,208 1,386 Railroad 1,251 1,190 Utilities and energy 703 561 Manufacturing, service and retailing 2,619 2,038 Investment and derivative gains/losses 4,693 (55,617 ) Other 473 333 Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 11,711 $ (49,746 ) Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected most of our operating businesses beginning in March of 2020, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Revenues and earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter of 2020. Over the second half of 2020 and continuing into the first quarter of 2021, many of these businesses experienced significant recoveries in revenues and earnings. Consequently, revenues and earnings in the first quarter of 2021 for these businesses were considerably higher than in the first quarter of 2020, although results for certain businesses were negatively affected by major winter storms in North America during February 2021. Certain of our other operating businesses continue to suffer adverse effects from the pandemic. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at our operations will completely normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Insurance underwriting produced after-tax earnings of $764 million in the first quarter of 2021 and $363 million in 2020. In each year, we generated underwriting earnings from primary insurance and underwriting losses from reinsurance assumed. Underwriting results in 2021 also reflected the effects of the pandemic, including premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program and reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile coverages. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in the first quarter of 2021 declined $178 million (12.8%) compared to 2020, primarily due to lower interest income earned on cash and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills. After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 5.1% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected overall higher freight volumes and lower costs due to improved productivity. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 25.3% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected increased earnings from the natural gas pipelines and real estate brokerage businesses, partially offset by lower earnings from the other energy businesses. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 28.5% in the first quarter of 2021 versus 2020. Overall, our businesses generated significantly higher earnings in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, which reflected the initial adverse effects of the pandemic. Investment and derivative gains/losses in 2021 and 2020 included significant gains and losses on equity securities, including unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 23 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses in excess of $100 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $121.6 billion as of March 31, 2021. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S.-based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2021 2020 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss): GEICO $ 1,023 $ 984 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 206 (33 ) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (263 ) (489 ) Pre-tax underwriting earnings 966 462 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 202 99 Net underwriting earnings $ 764 $ 363 Effective income tax rate 20.9 % 21.5 % GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2021 2020 Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 10,006 $ 9,681 Premiums earned $ 8,923 100.0 $ 9,109 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 6,463 72.4 6,766 74.3 Underwriting expenses 1,437 16.1 1,359 14.9 Total losses and expenses 7,900 88.5 8,125 89.2 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 1,023 $ 984 GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings for the first quarter of 2021 continues to reflect decreases in losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to lower average claims frequencies from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects were partially offset by lower premiums earned from the remaining effects of the GEICO Giveback program and higher average claims severities. Premiums written in the first quarter of 2021 increased 3.4% compared to 2020. The premium increase was primarily attributable to higher average voluntary auto policies-in-force, partially offset by a decrease in average premiums per auto policy due to coverage changes. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 124,000 during the first quarter of 2021. 24 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) The GEICO Giveback program provided a 15% premium credit to all new and renewal voluntary auto and motorcycle policies written between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Premiums earned in the first quarter of 2021 decreased by 2.0% compared to 2020, which included reductions of approximately $400 million attributable to the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback credit. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter of 2021 decreased $303 million (4.5%) compared to 2020. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to earnings in the first quarter of 2021 was 72.4%, a decrease of 1.9 percentage points compared to 2020, reflecting declines in claims frequencies, partially offset by increases in claims severities and the impact of lower premiums earned. Claims frequencies in the first quarter of 2021 were lower for property damage and bodily injury coverages (fourteen to fifteen percent range), personal injury coverage (ten to eleven percent range) and collision coverage (flat to one percent range). Average claims severities in the first quarter of 2021 were higher for property damage coverage (three to four percent range), collision coverage (ten to eleven percent range) and bodily injury coverage (twelve to thirteen percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter included reductions in the ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events of $521 million in 2021 and $148 million in 2020. Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2021 were $1.4 billion, an increase of $78 million (5.7%) compared to 2020, reflecting higher employee-related, advertising and technology costs partly offset by lower premium taxes. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) in the first quarter of 2021 was 16.1%, an increase of 1.2 percentage points compared to 2020, attributable to both the increase in expenses and the decline in earned premiums. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”) and National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2021 2020 Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 2,908 $ 2,455 Premiums earned $ 2,654 100.0 $ 2,369 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 1,849 69.7 1,811 76.4 Underwriting expenses 599 22.5 591 25.0 Total losses and expenses 2,448 92.2 2,402 101.4 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ 206 $ (33 ) Premiums written increased $453 million (18.5%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, driven by increases at BH Specialty (40%) and MedPro Group (24%). The increase at BH Specialty was primarily attributable to increased casualty business and the increase at MedPro Group reflected increases across certain product categories. BHHC’s premiums written declined 8% from the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to lower workers’ compensation volumes. The declines in workers’ compensation premiums reflected the effects of overall lower insured payroll levels attributable to the pandemic and continuing increased price competition in the market. 25 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) BH Primary’s loss ratio in the first quarter of 2021 was 69.7%, a decline of 6.7 percentage points versus 2020, which reflected net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $178 million in 2021 and $24 million in 2020. Estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2021 from a major winter storm in North America (“Winter Storm Uri”) in February 2021 were approximately $150 million. There were no significant catastrophe loss events in the first quarter of 2020. Incurred losses attributable to the pandemic were not significant in the first quarter of 2021 and were approximately $170 million in the first quarter of 2020. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2021 were relatively unchanged compared to 2020. The expense ratio declined 2.5 percentage points, reflecting changes in business mix and the impact of pandemic-related allowances for expected credit losses recorded in the first quarter of 2020. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also offer life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN. Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (in millions). First Quarter Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Property/casualty $ 3,394 $ 2,723 $ 166 $ (162 ) Life/health 1,305 1,351 (172 ) 5 Retroactive reinsurance — 34 (242 ) (42 ) Periodic payment annuity 144 159 (136 ) (56 ) Variable annuity 4 3 121 (234 ) $ 4,847 $ 4,270 $ (263 ) $ (489 ) Property/casualty A summary of property/casualty reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

The increase was primarily attributable to favorable foreign currency translation effects and changes in business mix. 26 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $287 million (13.5%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020 and the loss ratio decreased 7.0 percentage points, reflecting generally lower ratios in most of BHRG’s various product categories. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter of 2021 included estimated losses from Winter Storm Uri of approximately $310 million and a net increase in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $53 million. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2020 included $230 million attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a net reduction in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $28 million. Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. The expense ratio decreased 3.8 percentage points in the first quarter, attributable to changes in business mix and the impact of pandemic-related charges in the first quarter of 2020. Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2021 2020 Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 1,301 $ 1,352 Premiums earned $ 1,305 100.0 $ 1,351 100.0 Life and health insurance benefits 1,251 95.9 1,054 78.0 Underwriting expenses 226 17.3 292 21.6 Total benefits and expenses 1,477 113.2 1,346 99.6 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ (172 ) $ 5 Life/health premiums written decreased $51 million (3.8%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease reflected the non-renewal in 2021 of a policy that covered U.S. health insurance risks ($164 million), partially offset by volume growth in the Asian and European life markets and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Underwriting earnings in the first quarter of 2021 were negatively affected by significant increases in mortality in the U.S., Africa and Latin America, which were partially offset by lower underwriting expenses, due mainly to lower average commission rates in the international life business. Underwriting results in the first quarter of 2020 reflected pre-tax earnings from U.S. and international life business, partially offset by pre-tax losses from the run-off of U.S. long-term care business and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Retroactive reinsurance There were no significant retroactive reinsurance contracts written in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020. Pre-tax underwriting losses in each period derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign currency exchange effects were insignificant in the first quarter of 2021. Underwriting results in the first quarter of 2020 included foreign currency exchange gains of $205 million. Before foreign currency exchange effects, pre-tax underwriting losses in the first quarter were $243 million in 2021 and $247 million in 2020. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $40.7 billion at March 31, 2021 and $41.0 billion at December 31, 2020. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were $12.2 billion at March 31, 2021 and $12.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Deferred charge assets will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in the first quarter of 2021 decreased $15 million (9.4%) compared to 2020. Periodic payment annuity business is price sensitive. The volumes written can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. 27 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Periodic payment annuity (Continued) Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include the effects of mortality, interest rate changes that may affect expected settlements under certain contracts and gains or losses from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results in the first quarter included foreign currency exchange losses of $10 million in 2021 and gains of $105 million in 2020. Excluding foreign currency exchange gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses in the first quarter were $126 million in 2021 and $161 million in 2020, which primarily derived from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Pre-tax losses in the first quarter of 2021 were partially offset by the effects of higher mortality and interest rates. Discounted annuity liabilities were $14.4 billion at March 31, 2021, reflecting a weighted average discount rate of approximately 4.0%. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee contracts produced pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of $121 million in 2021 and pre-tax losses of $234 million in 2020. The results from these contracts reflect changes in our estimated liabilities for underlying guaranteed benefits, which are affected by changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting results from these contracts are volatile, reflecting the volatility of securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Underwriting earnings in the first quarter of 2021 were primarily attributable to the effects of interest rate changes, while the losses in 2020 reflected the impact of unfavorable changes in securities markets and interest rates. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter Percentage 2021 2020 Change Interest and other investment income $ 159 $ 404 (60.6 )% Dividend income 1,253 1,243 0.8 Pre-tax net investment income 1,412 1,647 (14.3 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 204 261 Net investment income $ 1,208 $ 1,386 Effective income tax rate 14.4 % 15.8 % Interest and other investment income in the first quarter of 2021 declined $245 million (60.6%) compared to 2020, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. We expect short-term interest rates, which are historically low, to remain low, negatively affecting our earnings from such investments for the remainder of 2021. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Dividend income was relatively unchanged from the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $140 billion at March 31, 2021 and $138 billion at December 31, 2020. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, and consequently, the average cost of float for each period was negative. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 follows (in millions).

Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major railroad business groups by type of product shipped which includes consumer products, industrial products, agricultural products and coal. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2021 2020 Railroad operating revenues $ 5,221 $ 5,244 Railroad operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 1,164 1,225 Fuel 550 614 Purchased services 505 517 Depreciation and amortization 616 611 Equipment rents, materials and other 491 450 Total 3,326 3,417 Railroad operating earnings 1,895 1,827 Other revenues (expenses): Other revenues 180 173 Other expenses, net (158 ) (154 ) Interest expense (258 ) (262 ) Pre-tax earnings 1,659 1,584 Income taxes 408 394 Net earnings $ 1,251 $ 1,190 Effective income tax rate 24.6 % 24.9 % The following table summarizes BNSF’s railroad freight volumes by business group (cars/units in thousands). Cars/Units First Quarter Percentage 2021 2020 Change Consumer products 1,393 1,207 15.4 % Industrial products 399 460 (13.3 ) Agricultural products 318 285 11.6 Coal 339 384 (11.7 ) 2,449 2,336 4.8 29 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant economic slowdown that adversely affected the demand for our services in 2020. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are ongoing, and the full extent to which it may impact our business and financial results remain uncertain and will depend on future developments. Railroad operating revenues decreased 0.4% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting increased volumes of 4.8%, offset by a 5.1% decrease in average revenue per car/unit resulting from business mix changes and lower fuel surcharge revenue driven by lower fuel prices. Pre-tax earnings were $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 4.7% compared to 2020. The increase principally resulted from increased volume and lower operating expenses due to overall improved productivity. Operating revenues from consumer products were $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 7.1% from 2020. The increase reflected higher volumes of 15.4%, partially offset by lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase is the result of growth in both international and domestic intermodal shipments driven by increased retail sales and inventory replenishments by retailers, along with increased e-commerce activity. Automotive shipments declined primarily attributable to production impacts from a global microchip shortage. Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of 16.3% from 2020. The decrease was attributable to lower volumes of 13.3% and lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume decrease was primarily driven by reduced production and demand in the energy sector, which contributed to lower petroleum products and sand volume. In addition, we experienced lower shipments of chemicals, plastics and aggregates due to the impact of winter storms in Texas and the U.S. Gulf Coast regions. Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 14.3% from 2020. The revenue increase reflected a volume increase of 11.6% in 2021 as compared to 2020, along with higher revenue per car/unit. Volumes increased primarily due to higher grain exports. Operating revenues from coal were $686 million in the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of 10.4% compared to 2020. The decrease reflected lower volume of 11.7%, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decline was primarily attributable to lower utility demand in the early part of the quarter, along with severe winter storms, which impacted deliveries. Railroad operating expenses in the first quarter of 2021 were $3.3 billion, a decrease of $91 million (2.7%) compared to 2020. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased 1.5 percentage points to 63.7% in 2021 versus 2020. Railroad operating expenses in 2021 reflected productivity improvements and lower average fuel prices. Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $61 million (5.0%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to fewer employees as a result of improved productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $64 million (10.4%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower gross ton mile volumes and higher fuel efficiency. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $41 million (9.1%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, resulting from higher miscellaneous taxes and property taxes. Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We currently own 91.1% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility in which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Three of these systems were acquired on November 1, 2020 from Dominion Energy, Inc. (“BHE GT&S acquisition”). Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. 30 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2021 2020 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 4,849 $ 3,634 Real estate operating revenue 1,232 893 Other income (loss) (157 ) (20 ) Total revenue 5,924 4,507 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 1,569 1,038 Energy operating expense 2,036 1,711 Real estate operating costs and expense 1,120 873 Interest expense 516 466 Total costs and expense 5,241 4,088 Pre-tax earnings 683 419 Income tax expense (benefit)* (232 ) (201 ) Net earnings after income taxes 915 620 Noncontrolling interests 106 3 Net earnings attributable to BHE 809 617 Noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends 106 56 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 703 $ 561 Effective income tax rate (34.0 )% (48.0 )% * Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation. The discussion of BHE’s operating results that follows is based on after-tax earnings, reflecting how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated. A summary of net earnings attributable to BHE follows (in millions). First Quarter Percentage 2021 2020 Change PacifiCorp $ 169 $ 176 (4.0 )% MidAmerican Energy Company 144 150 (4.0 ) NV Energy 34 20 70.0 Northern Powergrid 104 87 19.5 Natural gas pipelines 383 179 114.0 Other energy businesses 62 136 (54.4 ) Real estate brokerage 84 10 740.0 Corporate interest and other (171 ) (141 ) 21.3 $ 809 $ 617 31.1 PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. PacifiCorp after-tax earnings decreased $7 million in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease reflected higher depreciation and amortization expense, lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction and higher property taxes, partially offset by higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and increased income tax benefits from the impacts of ratemaking and higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. PacifiCorp utility margin was $818 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $29 million compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher retail revenue derived from a 0.3% increase in customer volumes, higher wholesale revenue and lower purchased power costs, partially offset by higher natural gas-fueled and coal-fueled generation costs. Retail customer volumes increased due to an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of weather, partially offset by lower customer usage. 31 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings decreased $6 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease reflected higher operating expenses, partially offset by increased income tax benefits and other income. The increase in operating expenses included costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, as well as higher electric and natural gas distribution costs. The income tax benefit increase was mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized from higher wind-powered generation, driven primarily by new wind projects placed in-service, partially offset by the impacts of ratemaking. MEC electric utility margin increased slightly to $394 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was attributable to higher operating revenue from wholesale and retail customer volumes, largely offset by higher generation and purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes in the first quarter increased 4.9%, primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather and increased usage by certain industrial customers. NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings increased $14 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected lower operating expenses, higher other income, lower interest expense and lower income tax expense from the impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by lower electric utility margin. The decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to lower plant operations and maintenance costs, partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional plant placed in-service. NV Energy electric utility margin decreased $18 million to $305 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower operating revenue from lower base tariff general rates at Nevada Power Company, a 3.2% decrease in electric retail customer volumes, including distribution-only service customers, and price impacts from changes in sales mix. The decrease in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the favorable impacts of weather. Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings increased $17 million in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to 2020. The earnings increase reflected higher distribution revenue, mainly from increased tariff rates, and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2021. Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $204 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The increase included earnings of $107 million from BHE GT&S, the effects of higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas. The higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas were largely due to the favorable impacts on demand from the February 2021 winter storms. Other energy business after-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2021 decreased $74 million compared to 2020, due to lower wind tax equity investment earnings of $93 million, partially offset by higher operating revenue from renewable energy projects. Wind tax equity investment earnings decreased due to increased losses from existing tax equity investments of $138 million, primarily due to the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation. Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $74 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, attributable to significantly higher earnings from mortgage and brokerage services. The increase in earnings from mortgage services was attributable to higher refinance activity and the earnings increase from brokerage services was due to a comparative increase in closed transaction volumes of 35%. Corporate interest and other after-tax losses increased $30 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2020 and higher operating expenses. 32 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions).

The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings in the preceding table were $180 million in 2021 and $202 million in 2020. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page 23 and in the “Other” earnings section on page 38. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter Percentage 2021 2020 Change Revenues Industrial products $ 6,672 $ 7,358 (9.3 )% Building products 5,628 4,857 15.9 Consumer products 3,613 2,820 28.1 $ 15,913 $ 15,035 Pre-tax earnings Industrial products $ 1,142 $ 1,306 (12.6 )% Building products 770 567 35.8 Consumer products 524 238 120.2 $ 2,436 $ 2,111 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Industrial products 17.1 % 17.7 % Building products 13.7 % 11.7 % Consumer products 14.5 % 8.4 % Industrial products The industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (“CTB”)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (“LSPI”)). Marmon consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, including equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries, which are internally aggregated into sectors (or “groups”). 33 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Revenues of the industrial products group in the first quarter of 2021 declined $686 million (9.3%) from the first quarter of 2020, while pre-tax earnings declined $164 million (12.6%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 17.1% in 2021 compared to 17.7% in 2020. Results in 2020 were negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. PCC’s revenues were $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of $884 million (36.2%) compared to 2020. Historically, PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and aircraft production in 2020. While air travel in the U.S. is increasing, we do not expect significant increases in aircraft production to occur in the near term. Consequently, we anticipate PCC’s revenues and earnings will remain relatively low in 2021. PCC’s pre-tax earnings decreased 33.5% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The earnings decrease reflected the decline in sales of aerospace products, partially offset by the effects of aggressive actions taken by management to resize and restructure operations to improve profitability. Lubrizol’s revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 5.1% compared to 2020, reflecting higher volumes and favorable sales mix. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume in the first quarter of 2021 increased 4.8% from 2020, primarily due to volume increases in Engineered Materials and Additives product lines. Despite an increase in sales and volume compared to the prior year, the Additives product line was affected by severe winter storms in February 2021 which caused the temporary shut-down of several U.S. facilities and negatively impacted sales in the quarter. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings decreased 13.4% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. Earnings in the first quarter of 2021 were negatively impacted by the weather-related temporary shut-down of Additives facilities in the U.S. Pre-tax earnings were reduced due to manufacturing inefficiencies, various incremental and non-recurring operating costs and lost sales margins. This was partially offset by increased pre-tax earnings from Life Sciences and Engineered Materials. Marmon’s revenues were $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $90 million (4.5%) over 2020. The increase reflected higher revenues in the Electrical and the Plumbing & Refrigeration business groups, primarily due to the impact of higher metals prices and higher volumes. Partially offsetting these increases were lower revenues from the Rail & Leasing group, attributable to lower leased fleet utilization and lease renewal rates and to lower railcar sales and repair services. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2021 decreased $17 million (5.8%) compared to 2020. Earnings in the first quarter of 2021 reflected lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Water Technologies groups, partly offset by higher earnings in nearly all other groups, led by Medical, Retail Solutions, Electrical and Industrial Products, as well as from lower restructuring costs. IMC’s revenues were $885 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 5.1% compared to 2020. Revenues in the first quarter of 2021 reflected favorable foreign currency translation effects and improving business conditions in many geographic regions. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 25.3% in the first quarter of 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to the favorable effects of improved manufacturing efficiencies, other operating cost savings initiatives and foreign currency translation. Building products The building products group includes manufactured and site-built construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). 34 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products (Continued) Revenues of the building products group increased $771 million (15.9%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020 and pre-tax earnings increased $203 million (35.8%) over 2020. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.7% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 11.7% in 2020. Residential housing construction demand in the U.S. was strong during 2020 and continued through the first quarter of 2021. These conditions, along with supply chain disruptions, contributed to significant cost increases for key materials and products used by our businesses, including lumber, steel, copper and fixtures, necessitating higher sales prices. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $544 million (30.9%) over 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues from home sales of $468 million (36%), reflecting a net increase in units sold, increased revenue per home sold and changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 45% in the first quarter of 2021, while factory-built manufactured home unit sales increased 2%. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities increased 17% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $17.4 billion as of March 31, 2021 compared to $17.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $391 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $190 million (94.5%) compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 reflected higher earnings from home sales, mortgage originations, net interest income and a decline of $60 million in provisions for expected credit losses. The provisions for expected credit losses in the first quarter of 2020 were unusually high and included provisions for the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 7.3% versus 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes for paint and coatings, residential flooring, roofing and other building systems and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were $379 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 3.4% over 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues and operating cost control efforts, partly offset by rising costs and availability of certain materials and freight services from the adverse effects of supply chain disruptions and severe storms in 2021. Consumer products The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). Consumer products revenues increased $793 million (28.1%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, while pre-tax earnings increased $286 million (120.2%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues increased 6.1 percentage points to 14.5%. Revenues in the first quarter of 2021 increased significantly over 2020 at nearly all of our businesses. Revenues and earnings in the first quarter of 2020 were negatively affected by the pandemic. In the first quarter of 2021, revenues from Forest River increased 39.7% over 2020, driven by increased unit sales for recreational vehicles. Apparel and footwear sales increased 21.7% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, reflecting strong sales growth from Brooks Sports (41.6%) and increased apparel volumes attributable in part to inventory restocking by certain customers. Duracell’s revenues in the first quarter of 2021 increased 16.9% over 2020. The increase in pre-tax earnings was primarily attributable to revenue increases from Forest River, Brooks Sports, Duracell, and the apparel businesses, as well as the impact of inventory obsolescence allowances that were recorded in the first quarter of 2020. 35 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter Percentage 2021 2020 Change Revenues Service $ 3,605 $ 3,358 7.4 % Retailing 4,353 3,598 21.0 McLane Company 11,622 11,821 (1.7 ) $ 19,580 $ 18,777 Pre-tax earnings Service $ 590 $ 425 38.8 % Retailing 348 133 161.7 McLane Company 103 65 58.5 $ 1,041 $ 623 Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues Service 16.4 % 12.7 % Retailing 8.0 % 3.7 % McLane Company 0.9 % 0.5 % Service Our service business group offers shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI), franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen) and offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and the operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Service group revenues increased 7.4% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 and pre-tax earnings increased $165 million (38.8%) versus 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 16.4% in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 3.7 percentage points compared to 2020. Revenues of TTI increased 26.4% in the first quarter of 2021 versus 2020, reflecting higher demand across all significant markets within the electronic components industry as customers were restocking inventories in response to supply chain disruptions and international trade disputes. Revenues from aviation services (NetJets and FlightSafety) declined 1.3%, primarily due to lower commercial and corporate training hours at FlightSafety. Aggregate flight hours at NetJets were relatively unchanged. The comparative increase in earnings reflected increased earnings at several of the service businesses, with the most significant increases from TTI and the aviation services businesses. The increase in earnings from NetJets and FlightSafety was primarily attributable to improved operating margins from changes in business mix, lower fuel and travel costs, increased operating efficiencies and the effects of past restructuring efforts. TTI’s earnings increase was attributable to the increase in sales and improved operating cost leverage. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”), which consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA represented about 63% of our combined retailing revenues in 2021. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics and represented about 21% of the combined retailing revenues in 2021. Other retailing businesses also include three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories. 36 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) Retailing group revenues increased $755 million (21.0%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 and pre-tax earnings increased $215 million (161.7%). Operating results of nearly all of our retailing businesses were severely impacted by the pandemic beginning in March of 2020 and continuing through the second quarter of 2020. Over the second half of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, revenues and pre-tax earnings of these businesses increased, and in certain instances to levels exceeding those in pre-pandemic periods, despite ongoing supply chain disruptions. BHA’s revenues in the first quarter of 2021 increased 17.4% from 2020, primarily due to a 21% increase in new and pre-owned vehicle sales, mainly attributable to higher volumes. Home furnishings group revenues increased $157 million (21.0%) in the first quarter of 2021 over 2020, while aggregate revenues of our other retailing operations increased 36.9%. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased $67 million over 2020, primarily due to increases in vehicle gross sales margins and earnings from finance and service contract activities as well as from lower floorplan interest expense and operating cost control efforts. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $148 million compared to the first quarter of 2020. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales typically comprise about two-thirds of McLane’s consolidated sales with foodservice comprising much of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. The grocery and foodservice businesses, in particular, operate in an intensely competitive business environment. Revenues decreased $199 million (1.7%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. Revenues from the grocery business declined 5.3%, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 4.4% and 20.2%, respectively, compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2021 increased $38 million (58.5%) versus 2020. The increase in earnings was primarily due to increased earnings from the beverage business, ongoing cost management efforts and the effects of expected credit losses and inventory losses of $17 million recorded in the first quarter of 2020 attributable to the pandemic. Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains/losses follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2021 2020 Investment gains/losses $ 5,211 $ (68,882 ) Derivative gains/losses 489 (1,393 ) Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 5,700 (70,275 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,007 (14,658 ) Net gains/losses $ 4,693 $ (55,617 ) Effective income tax rate 18.8 % 20.8 % Investment gains/losses We are required to include the unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains/losses in the first quarter included net unrealized gains of $4.6 billion in 2021 and net unrealized losses of $68.5 billion in 2020 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold in the first quarter, which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $1.8 billion in 2021 and $1.2 billion in 2020. 37 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) Investment gains/losses (Continued) We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant due to the volatility of market prices in the underlying equity markets. As of March 31, 2021, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was $211 million and our recorded liability at fair value was $577 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under these contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). First Quarter 2021 2020 Equity method earnings $ 214 $ 256 Acquisition accounting expenses (180 ) (202 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (80 ) (96 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes 525 175 Other (6 ) 200 $ 473 $ 333 After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. Our after-tax earnings from Kraft Heinz for the first quarter were $135 million in 2021 and $99 million in 2020. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s outstanding Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce non-cash unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at March 31, 2021 was $448 billion, an increase of $4.8 billion since December 31, 2020. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders were $11.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021 and included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $4.3 billion. Changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities can produce volatility in our earnings. At March 31, 2021, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $138.1 billion, which included $115.3 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills, and is net of payables for unsettled purchases as of March 31. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $302.1 billion. 38 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition (Continued) Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at March 31, 2021 was $21.0 billion, a decrease of $1.7 billion since December 31, 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, Berkshire repaid €550 million and $1.0 billion of maturing senior notes and issued €600 million of 0.5% senior notes due in 2041. In April 2021, Berkshire issued ¥160 billion (approximately $1.5 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2041 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. Berkshire parent company debt maturities over the next twelve months are approximately $1.1 billion. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $18.6 billion at March 31, 2021, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $13.1 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In January 2021, BHFC repaid $750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $750 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2051. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of these two operations in the first quarter of 2021 were $1.9 billion and we currently forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $8.5 billion over the remainder of 2021. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $22.8 billion as of March 31, 2021, a decrease of $404 million from December 31, 2020. In April 2021, BNSF issued $925 million of 3.3% debentures due in 2051. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $52.2 billion at March 31, 2021, essentially unchanged since December 31, 2020. In April 2021, a BHE subsidiary issued $550 million of 3.4% term debt due in 2051. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $3.0 billion. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In the first quarter of 2021, Berkshire paid $6.6 billion to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future are not currently reflected in the financial statements, which will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events and the actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the first quarter 2021, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt. Such debt, in U.S. Dollars, approximated $1.5 billion in the aggregate. Principal and interest payments associated with these borrowings are expected as follows: in 2021 – $9.4 million; in 2022 through 2025 – $22.3 million per annum; and thereafter – $2.0 billion. In April 2021, Berkshire and certain subsidiaries issued term debt, which in U.S. Dollars aggregated $2.9 billion. Maturities for these issuances range from 2026 to 2051 and the debt has a weighted average interest rate of 1.925%. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2021 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in the “Contractual Obligations” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 39 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2021 includes estimated liabilities of $121.6 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2021 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.7 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2020. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. As of March 31, 2021, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently estimate and we may need to record additional goodwill or indefinite-lived asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units and judgments on goodwill impairments at this time are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on a reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations, the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. 40 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of March 31, 2021, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. 41 Part II Other Information Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the first quarter of 2021 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program January Class A common stock 1,534 $ 348,488.65 1,534 * Class B common stock 10,661,127 $ 231.68 10,661,127 * February Class A common stock 1,959 $ 362,748.29 1,959 * Class B common stock 5,341,489 $ 237.06 5,341,489 * March Class A common stock 1,113 $ 396,162.91 1,113 * Class B common stock 4,545,124 $ 251.40 4,545,124 * * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $20 billion.

General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Changes to those policies due to the adoption of new accounting standards are described in Note 2. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, changes in the fair values of certain derivative contract liabilities, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the magnitude of asset impairment charges can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread rapidly across the world in 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in March. COVID-19 has since adversely affected nearly all of our operations, although the effects are varying significantly. The duration and extent of the effects over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The risks and uncertainties resulting from the pandemic that may affect our future earnings, cash flows and financial condition include the time necessary to develop and produce a safe and effective vaccine that can be widely distributed throughout the world and the long-term effect on the demand for certain of our products and services. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Additionally, GEICO’s underwriting results will likely be negatively affected over the remainder of the year and in the first quarter of 2021, as the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback program (a program whereby all voluntary auto and motorcycle insurance policies renewed and newly issued during the period between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020 receive a 15 % premium rate reduction) will be reflected in earned premiums during these periods. Note 2. New accounting pronouncements We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January 1, 2020 . ASC 326 provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried at amortized cost based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses therefore include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. We elected to not measure an allowance for expected credit losses on accrued interest and instead reverse uncollectible accrued interest through interest income on a timely basis. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a charge to retained earnings of $ 388 million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses, which was primarily related to our manufactured housing loans. Expected credit losses for such financial assets are based on the net present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of expected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality indicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates, historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans, the historical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other matters. In addition, our estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 8 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2. New accounting pronouncements (Continued) Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables are primarily short-term in duration with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination. In establishing credit loss allowances for such receivables, we primarily utilize credit loss history. However, credit loss allowances may be adjusted as a result of current conditions and when we expect reasonable and supportable forecasts to deviate from historical experience. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables, we review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider credit ratings, right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement including, collateral, funds held arrangements, guarantees, as well as other publicly available information. We adopted ASU 2017-04 “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” as of January 1, 2020 . Under ASU 2017-04, the measurement of a goodwill impairment is represented by the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the reporting unit and is limited to the carrying value of goodwill. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts.” ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used to value policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs arising from long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts, with the effects of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount rate assumptions reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 3.

On August 8, 2019, Berkshire invested a total of $ 10 billion in Occidental Corporation (“Occidental”) newly issued Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $ 10 billion, and warrants to purchase up to 80 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $ 62.50 per share. In accordance with the terms of the warrants, on August 3, 2020, the number of shares of common stock that can be purchased was increased to 83.86 million shares and the exercise price was reduced to $ 59.62 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8 % per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, or mandatorily under certain specified capital return events. Dividends on the preferred stock may be paid in cash or, at Occidental’s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. Our investments in Occidental are included in the commercial, industrial and other category in the preceding tables. Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 325,442,152 shares of Kraft Heinz common stock representing 26.6 % of the outstanding shares. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $ 9.7 billion at September 30, 2020 and $ 10.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $ 13.1 billion at September 30, 2020 and $ 13.8 billion at December 31, 2019. 10 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5. Equity method investments (Continued) Berkshire’s equity method earnings from Kraft Heinz were $ 159 million in the third quarter of 2020. Equity method losses from Kraft Heinz were $ 180 million in the first nine months of 2020, which included approximately $ 850 million for our proportionate share of goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. As previously disclosed in Berkshire’s Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2019, Kraft Heinz’s financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2019 were not available until August 13, 2019 when Kraft Heinz filed financial statements for those periods with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Thus, Berkshire did not record equity method earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz for each of those periods until the third quarter of 2019. Berkshire’s equity method earnings in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 included $ 467 million with respect to Kraft Heinz’s results for the first nine months of 2019, of which $ 228 million was attributable to Kraft Heinz’s results for the first six months of 2019. Berkshire’s equity method share of the Kraft Heinz goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment charges for the first nine months of 2019 was $ 293 million. We received dividends on the common stock of $ 391 million in each of the first nine months of 2020 and 2019, which were recorded as reductions to the carrying value of our investment. As of September 30, 2020, the carrying value of our investment in Kraft Heinz exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by $ 3.4 billion ( 26 % of carrying value). In light of that fact, we evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. We utilize no bright-line tests in such evaluations. Based on the available facts and information regarding the operating results of Kraft Heinz, our ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery, the relative amount of the decline, and the length of time that fair value was less than carrying value, we concluded that recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required. However, we will continue to monitor this investment and it is possible that an impairment loss will be recorded in earnings in future periods based on changes in facts and circumstances or intentions. Summarized consolidated financial information of Kraft Heinz follows (in millions). September 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Assets $ 98,122 $ 101,450 Liabilities 48,783 49,701 Third Quarter First Nine Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Sales $ 6,441 $ 6,076 $ 19,246 $ 18,441 Net earnings (loss) attributable to Kraft Heinz common shareholders* 597 899 ( 676 ) 1,753 * Includes goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment charges of approximately $ 3.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020 and $ 1.1 billion in the first nine months of 2019. Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”) and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”). The carrying value of our investments in these entities was approximately $ 4.1 billion as of September 30, 2020 and $ 3.7 billion as of December 31, 2019. Our equity method earnings from these entities in the first nine months were $ 513 million in 2020 and $ 491 million in 2019. Additional information concerning these investments follows. We own a 50 % interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50 % interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through its issuance of commercial paper, which is currently limited to $ 1.5 billion. On September 30, 2020, Berkadia’s commercial paper outstanding was $ 1.47 billion. The commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. A Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company subsidiary owns a 50 % interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint. American Electric Power owns the other 50 % interest. In 2017, we acquired a 38.6 % interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North America, supplying more than 11 billion gallons of fuel per year via more than 950 retail locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces and through wholesale distribution. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1 % interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining 11.3 % interest. We also entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4 % interest in Pilot in 2023, with the Haslam family retaining a 20 % interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023. 11 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 6.

Goodwill and other intangible assets (Continued) Intangible asset amortization expense in the first nine months was $ 962 million in 2020 and $ 986 million in 2019. Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $ 18.3 billion as of September 30, 2020 and $ 19.0 billion as of December 31, 2019 and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. During the second quarter of 2020, we concluded it was necessary to reevaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of certain of our reporting units for impairment due to the disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. We believed that the most significant of these disruptions related to the air travel and commercial aerospace and supporting industries. We recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of approximately $ 10 billion and pre-tax indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $ 638 million in the second quarter of 2020. Approximately $ 10 billion of these charges related to Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), the largest business within Berkshire's manufacturing segment. The carrying value of PCC-related goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets prior to the impairment charges was approximately $ 31 billion. The amounts of the impairment charges were determined based on discounted cash flow methods and reflect our current assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with the aerospace industry. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results in the future may vary significantly from the forecasts. Disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic will likely continue to evolve and the effects on our businesses may differ from what we currently estimate. If the effects prove to be worse than is reflected in our current estimates, additional goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges could be required. Note 13. Derivative contracts We are party to derivative contracts through certain of our subsidiaries. The most significant derivative contracts consist of equity index put option contracts. The liabilities and related notional values of these contracts follow (in millions). Liabilities Notional Value September 30, 2020 $ 1,547 $ 12,472 December 31, 2019 968 14,385 The equity index put option contracts are European style options written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. Notional value in the preceding table represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming the value of each index is zero at each contract’s expiration date. Certain contracts are denominated in foreign currencies and the related notional amounts are based on the foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. These contracts produced pre-tax losses of $ 43 million in the third quarter and $ 640 million in the first nine months of 2020 and pre-tax gains of $ 234 million in the third quarter and $ 1,217 million in the first nine months of 2019. Substantially all open contracts as of September 30, 2020 will expire by February 2023 . The weighted average life of unexpired contracts at September 30, 2020 was approximately 1.25 years. Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike price at the contract expiration date. We received aggregate premiums of $ 2.1 billion on the contract inception dates with respect to unexpired contracts as of September 30, 2020 and we have no counterparty credit risk. The aggregate intrinsic value (the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date) was $ 1.2 billion at September 30, 2020 and $ 397 million at December 31, 2019. These contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the contract expiration dates and the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses will not be determined until the contract expiration dates. Our regulated utility subsidiaries are exposed to variations in the prices of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity purchased and sold and natural gas supplied for customers. We may use forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options to manage a portion of these price risks. Most of the net derivative contract assets or liabilities of our regulated utilities are probable of recovery through rates and are offset by regulatory liabilities or assets. 16 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 15), for each of the nine months ending September 30, 2020 and 2019 follows (in millions). 2020 2019 Balances at beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 73,019 $ 68,458 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 2,855 ) ( 3,060 ) Net liabilities 70,164 65,398 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events 31,777 31,179 Prior accident years’ events 69 ( 396 ) Total 31,846 30,783 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events ( 11,691 ) ( 13,144 ) Prior accident years’ events ( 15,259 ) ( 13,967 ) Total ( 26,950 ) ( 27,111 ) Foreign currency translation adjustment 124 ( 178 ) Balances at September 30: Net liabilities 75,184 68,892 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 2,857 3,105 Gross liabilities $ 78,041 $ 71,997 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). We recorded a net increase in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 69 million in the first nine months of 2020 and a net decrease of $ 396 million in the first nine months of 2019, which produced a corresponding increase and decrease in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. These changes in the ultimate liability estimates as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year were relatively insignificant. In the first nine months of 2020, we reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events for primary insurance by $ 273 million and increased estimates for reinsurance liabilities by $ 342 million. The net decrease for primary insurance was primarily attributable to lower than anticipated private passenger automobile, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims. The net increase related to reinsurance included increased claims estimates for legacy casualty exposures. In the first nine months of 2019, the net decrease in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years was primarily attributable to private passenger automobile, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims, partly offset by increased liabilities for legacy casualty exposures and other commercial insurance business. 17 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract inception date or, when applicable, once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the nine months ending September 30, 2020 and 2019 follow (in millions). 2020 2019 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Balances at beginning of year $ 42,441 $ ( 13,747 ) $ 41,834 $ ( 14,104 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current year contracts — — 175 ( 82 ) Prior years’ contracts 131 735 ( 2 ) 827 Total 131 735 173 745 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 786 ) — ( 643 ) — Balances at September 30 $ 41,786 $ ( 13,012 ) $ 41,364 $ ( 13,359 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 866 $ 918 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first nine months related to contracts written in prior years were $ 866 million in 2020 and $ 825 million in 2019. Such losses reflected the recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effects of changes in the estimated timing and amount of future loss payments. Berkshire’s subsidiary, National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), is party to a contract with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”), in which NICO’s ultimate liability is contractually limited to $ 20 billion. Our estimated ultimate claim liabilities with respect to the AIG contract at both September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were $ 18.2 billion. Deferred charge assets related to the AIG contract were approximately $ 5.8 billion at September 30, 2020 and $ 6.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Note 16. Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (dollars in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of September 30, 2020. Weighted Average Interest Rate September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Insurance and other: Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) In March 2020, Berkshire repaid € 1.0 billion of maturing senior notes and issued € 1.0 billion of 0.0 % senior notes due in 2025 . In April 2020, Berkshire issued ¥ 195.5 billion (approximately $ 1.8 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2060 and a weighted average interest rate of 1.07 %. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In the first nine months of 2020, BHFC repaid $ 350 million of maturing senior notes and issued $ 500 million of 1.85 % senior notes due in 2030 . In October 2020, BHFC repaid $ 550 million of maturing senior notes and issued $ 2.5 billion of senior notes consisting of $ 750 million of 1.45 % senior notes due in 2030 and $ 1.75 billion of 2.85 % senior notes due in 2050 . The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 6.85 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 625.5 billion par) reflect the applicable foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax losses of $ 549 million in the third quarter and $ 447 million in the first nine months of 2020 and pre-tax gains of $ 383 million in the third quarter and $ 447 million in the first nine months of 2019. In addition to BHFC borrowings, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $ 1.2 billion of other subsidiary borrowings at September 30, 2020. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. Weighted Average Interest Rate September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2021 - 2050 4.5 % $ 11,462 $ 8,581 Subsidiary and other debt due 2020 - 2064 4.3 % 31,693 30,772 Short-term borrowings 1.8 % 2,400 3,214 Burlington Northern Santa Fe and subsidiaries due 2020 - 2097 4.6 % 23,245 23,211 $ 68,800 $ 65,778 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. During the first nine months of 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new term debt of approximately $ 5.5 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2062 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.4 %. In the first nine months of 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries repaid $ 1.9 billion of debt and reduced short-term borrowings. On October 29, 2020, BHE issued $ 500 million of 1.65 % senior notes due in 2031 and $ 1.5 billion of 2.85 % senior notes due in 2051 . BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In April 2020, BNSF issued $ 575 million of 3.05 % senior unsecured debentures due in 2051 . During the first nine months of 2020, BNSF repaid $ 541 million of debt. As of September 30, 2020, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2020, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $ 9.5 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included approximately $ 7.8 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 19 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 17.

Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 follow (in millions). Gains (losses) included in: Balance at beginning of year Earnings Regulatory assets and liabilities Acquisitions, dispositions and settlements Balance at September 30 Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities: 2020 $ 10,407 $ ( 2,235 ) $ — $ ( 2 ) $ 8,170 2019 7 499 — 10,002 10,508 Net derivative contract liabilities: 2020 ( 857 ) ( 72 ) ( 36 ) ( 398 ) ( 1,363 ) 2019 ( 2,343 ) 1,528 ( 41 ) ( 282 ) ( 1,138 ) Quantitative information as of September 30, 2020 with respect to significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follows (dollars in millions).

See Note 4 for information regarding these investments. These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. In applying discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the Occidental Preferred, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the Occidental common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. 21 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 17. Fair value measurements (Continued) Our equity index put option derivative contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. We determine the fair value of the equity index put option contract liabilities based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. As described in Note 12, we recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in the second quarter of 2020. These charges reflected our estimates of fair values of the related reporting units for goodwill and of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, and the related measurements are considered Level 3 measurements. In estimating fair values of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we consider the available facts and circumstances concerning the reporting unit and the industries in which it operates. The key assumptions and inputs we generally use in such determinations include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as the selection of a discount rate and other inputs. These inputs also include our qualitative assessment of risks and uncertainties. We utilized discounted cash flow/earnings methods to develop our estimates of the fair values and we also considered other publicly available information. Estimates of the fair value of reporting units can be significantly affected by expectations of the severity, duration or long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict at this time. Consequently, fair value estimates in such instances may be subject to wide variations. We concluded it was appropriate to reflect the increased risks and uncertainties precipitated by the pandemic through a combination of increases in discount rates and reductions to operating and long-term growth assumptions. We also incorporated forecasted operating results that were reduced from what was used in estimating fair value in connection with the 2019 annual impairment test conducted during the fourth quarter. Note 18. Common stock Changes i n Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the first nine months of 2020 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Class A, $ 5 Par Value ( 1,650,000 shares authorized) Class B, $ 0.0033 Par Value ( 3,225,000,000 shares authorized) Issued Treasury Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding Balances at December 31, 2019 719,307 ( 17,337 ) 701,970 1,408,183,852 ( 23,702,319 ) 1,384,481,533 Conversions of Class A common stock to Class B common stock ( 39,694 ) — ( 39,694 ) 59,541,000 — 59,541,000 Treasury stock acquired — ( 11,330 ) ( 11,330 ) — ( 64,487,462 ) ( 64,487,462 ) Balances at September 30, 2020 679,613 ( 28,667 ) 650,946 1,467,724,852 ( 88,189,781 ) 1,379,535,071 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,570,636 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2020 and 1,624,958 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $ 20 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. 22 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were 19.8 % for the third quarter and 30.8 % for the first nine months of 2020 and 18.7 % for the third quarter and 20.2 % for the first nine months of 2019. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, the magnitude of gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities and of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. In July 2020, Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) reached a definitive agreement with Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) to acquire substantially all of Dominion’s natural gas transmission and storage business, which includes more than 7,700 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines, about 900 billion cubic feet of operated natural gas storage capacity and partial ownership of a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility. The agreement provided for an aggregate acquisition price of approximately $ 4.0 billion and that BHE would also assume approximately $ 5.7 billion of existing asset-related long-term debt. 23 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 22. Contingencies and commitments (Continued) On October 5, 2020 , BHE and Dominion agreed, as permitted under the acquisition agreement, to provide for the acquisition of all originally agreed upon businesses, except for certain pipeline assets (the “Excluded Assets”), for approximately $ 2.7 billion in cash and BHE’s assumption of approximately $ 5.3 billion of debt. This acquisition was completed on November 1, 2020 . In addition, on October 5, 2020 , BHE and Dominion entered into a second acquisition agreement providing for BHE’s acquisition of the Excluded Assets for approximately $ 1.3 billion in cash and BHE’s assumption of approximately $ 0.4 billion of debt. The closing of this acquisition is subject to receiving necessary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to occur in early 2021. Note 23. Revenues from contracts with customers We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 and 2019 (in millions). Other revenues included in consolidated revenues were primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. Revenues and earnings before income taxes by segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in millions).

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 24 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. As the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated beginning in the second half of March, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Revenues and earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter due to closures of facilities where crowds gather, such as retail stores, restaurants and entertainment venues, public travel restrictions and from closures of certain of our businesses. In the third quarter of 2020, several of these businesses experienced significant increases in revenues and earnings as compared to the second quarter. Our businesses that are deemed essential have continued to operate through the pandemic, including our railroad, utilities and energy, insurance and certain of our manufacturing, wholesale distribution and service businesses. In response to the effects of the pandemic, our businesses have implemented various business continuity plans to protect our employees and customers. Such plans include a variety of actions, such as temporarily closing certain retail stores, manufacturing facilities and service centers of businesses that were not subject to government mandated closure. Our businesses have also implemented practices to protect employees while at work. Such practices have included work-from-home, staggered or reduced work schedules, increased cleaning and sanitation of work spaces, providing employee health screenings, eliminating non-essential travel and face-to-face meetings and providing general health reminders intended to lower the risk of spreading COVID-19. We have taken actions in response to the economic losses from reductions in consumer demand for products and services we offer and our inability to produce goods and provide services at certain of our businesses. These actions have included employee furloughs, wage and salary reductions, capital spending reductions and other actions intended to help mitigate the economic losses and preserve capital and liquidity. Certain of our businesses are undertaking and will likely continue to undertake restructuring activities that will resize their operations to better fit expected customer demand. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at our numerous and diverse operations will normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. 27 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance underwriting produced after-tax losses of $213 million in the third quarter and after-tax earnings of $956 million in the first nine months of 2020. The effects of the premium rate reductions from the GEICO Giveback program contributed to a significant decline in underwriting earnings in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to the first two quarters of the year. The effects of the rate reductions under the program will continue over the remainder of 2020 and through the first quarter of 2021 as the reduced levels of premiums written are earned and included in our reported revenues. To the extent claims frequencies over this period revert to historical levels, GEICO may incur underwriting losses. Insurance underwriting results in 2020 also included after-tax losses from other primary insurance and from reinsurance activities. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2020 were lower in the third quarter and first nine months as compared to 2019, reflecting lower interest income primarily attributable to declines in interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. After-tax earnings of our railroad business decreased 8.1% in the third quarter and 9.6% in the first nine months of 2020 as compared to 2019. Earnings in 2020 reflected lower railroad operating revenues from lower shipping volumes, attributable to the negative effects of COVID-19, partly offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 18.4% in the third quarter and 8.3% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. The increases reflected increased tax benefits from renewable energy and increased earnings from the real estate brokerage business. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined 4.4% in the third quarter and 18.3% in the first nine months of 2020 versus 2019. The economic effects of COVID-19 are varying among our manufacturing businesses. Investment and derivative gains/losses in 2020 and 2019 included significant gains and losses on equity securities, including unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Other earnings in the first nine months of 2020 included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $11.0 billion, including our equity method share of impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Substantially all of these charges were recorded in the second quarter. Approximately $9.8 billion of these charges are attributable to impairments of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held strategy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance businesses. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider pre-tax losses in excess of $100 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $120 billion as of September 30, 2020. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Underwriting results in 2020 of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses were negatively affected by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including estimated provisions for claims and uncollectible premiums and incremental operating costs to maintain customer service levels at certain underwriting units. The potential effects of the pandemic may be further affected by future judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims that we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. Our underwriting results for the remainder of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 for certain business may be adversely affected from lower premiums attributable to credits granted to policyholders and where premiums are a function of the insured’s payroll. 28 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss): GEICO $ 276 $ 376 $ 3,320 $ 1,539 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (126 ) 153 (63 ) 290 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (441 ) 52 (2,033 ) (305 ) Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) (291 ) 581 1,224 1,524 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (78 ) 141 268 342 Net underwriting earnings (loss) $ (213 ) $ 440 $ 956 $ 1,182 Effective income tax rate 26.6 % 24.1 % 21.9 % 23.0 % GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 8,446 $ 9,412 $ 26,217 $ 27,378 Premiums earned $ 8,540 100.0 $ 8,996 100.0 $ 26,689 100.0 $ 26,487 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 6,858 80.3 7,344 81.6 19,238 72.1 21,176 80.0 Underwriting expenses 1,406 16.5 1,276 14.2 4,131 15.5 3,772 14.2 Total losses and expenses 8,264 96.8 8,620 95.8 23,369 87.6 24,948 94.2 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 276 $ 376 $ 3,320 $ 1,539 GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first nine months of 2020 reflected significant declines in losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to lower claims frequencies from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the effects of the GEICO Giveback program (see following paragraph) on earned premiums will continue through the fourth quarter, GEICO could experience pre-tax underwriting losses if claims frequencies increase over the same period, offsetting a portion of the pre-tax underwriting earnings generated in the first nine months of 2020. Premiums written decreased 10.3% in the third quarter and 4.2% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. The GEICO Giveback program provides for a 15% premium credit to all voluntary auto and motorcycle policies renewing between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020, as well as to any new policies written during the same period. The GEICO Giveback program reduced premiums written in the first nine months of 2020 by approximately $2.8 billion. Premiums earned decreased 5.1% in the third quarter and were relatively unchanged in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019, which included reductions of approximately $1.0 billion in the third quarter and $1.3 billion in the first nine months attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. Premiums earned will very likely decline in the fourth quarter even if policies-in-force and exposures increase. Voluntary auto policies-in-force grew 5.4% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. The increase resulted from a 9.1% decrease in lost policies and a 3.4% decrease in new business sales. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, GEICO paused cancellations of insurance policies for non-payment through the end of May 2020. During the third quarter, policy cancellations for non-payment resumed leading to an 18.3% increase in lost policies for the third quarter as compared to 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $486 million (6.6%) in the third quarter and $1.9 billion (9.2%) in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) decreased 1.3 percentage points in the third quarter and 7.9 percentage points in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. The decreases in the loss ratio reflected declines in claims frequencies, partly offset by increases in claims severities and the impact of lower premiums earned attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. 29 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Claims frequencies in the first nine months of 2020 were lower for property damage, bodily injury and personal injury protection coverages (twenty-nine to thirty-one percent range) and collision coverage (twenty-four to twenty-six percent range) compared to 2019. Average claims severities in the first nine months of 2020 were higher for property damage coverage (ten to twelve percent range), collision coverage (seven to nine percent range) and bodily injury coverage (ten to twelve percent range). GEICO’s loss and loss adjustment expenses in the first nine months of 2020 and 2019 included relatively insignificant reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior year’s loss events. Underwriting expenses in the first nine months of 2020 increased $359 million (9.5%) compared to 2019. GEICO’s expense ratio in the first nine months of 2020 (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) increased 1.3 percentage points compared to 2019, of which 0.7 percentage points was attributable to the decline in earned premiums from the GEICO Giveback program. The increase in underwriting expenses reflected higher employee-related and technology costs partly offset by lower premium and state taxes. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), and National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 3,003 $ 2,824 $ 7,607 $ 7,535 Premiums earned $ 2,490 100.0 $ 2,387 100.0 $ 7,103 100.0 $ 6,825 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 1,976 79.4 1,583 66.3 5,369 75.6 4,721 69.2 Underwriting expenses 640 25.7 651 27.3 1,797 25.3 1,814 26.6 Total losses and expenses 2,616 105.1 2,234 93.6 7,166 100.9 6,535 95.8 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ (126 ) $ 153 $ (63 ) $ 290 Premiums written increased $179 million (6.3%) in the third quarter and $72 million (1.0%) in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The increases reflected volume increases from BH Specialty in non-U.S. property and casualty and U.S. casualty business and from MedPro Group across several product categories. These increases were partly offset by lower workers’ compensation business (BHHC and GUARD) in the third quarter and first nine months and by lower commercial auto business (BHHC and NICO Primary) over the first half of the year. The declines in workers’ compensation and commercial auto business written reflected the effects of reduced exposures and premium refunds related to the COVID-19 pandemic, volume reductions attributable to increased price competition in the market and the effect of the divestiture of Applied Underwriters in 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2020 included an increase in estimated losses of approximately $400 million attributable to the pandemic (primarily in the first six months) and to Hurricanes Laura and Sally in the third quarter. In addition, losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first nine months were reduced $190 million in 2020 and $274 million in 2019 for changes in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of liability insurance and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs are generally subject to longer claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher than expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings, regulatory actions and other factors not currently anticipated. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and General Re Life Corporation (“General Re”). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN. 30 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment.

The increases were primarily attributable to a few new property and liability contracts and increased participations on renewals. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $885 million (53.3%) in the third quarter and $2.4 billion (48.1%) in the first nine months of 2020 over the same periods in 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2020 included estimated losses of $113 million in the third quarter and $688 million in the first nine months attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and $308 million from Hurricanes Laura and Sally in the third quarter. Losses incurred in the third quarter of 2019 included $281 million from Typhoon Faxai. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first nine months also included a net increase in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $342 million in 2020 compared to a net decrease of $75 million in 2019. The increase in 2020 was primarily attributable to legacy environmental, asbestos and other latent injury claims. Underwriting expenses in the first nine months of 2020 increased 23.8% over 2019, primarily due to increased commissions expense on the increased premium volume. 31 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 1,383 $ 1,095 $ 4,153 $ 3,207 Premiums earned $ 1,378 100.0 $ 1,093 100.0 $ 4,147 100.0 $ 3,199 100.0 Life and health insurance benefits 1,142 82.9 836 76.5 3,328 80.3 2,345 73.3 Underwriting expenses 219 15.9 220 20.1 756 18.2 627 19.6 Total benefits and expenses 1,361 98.8 1,056 96.6 4,084 98.5 2,972 92.9 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 17 $ 37 $ 63 $ 227 Life/health premiums written increased $288 million (26.3%) in the third quarter and $946 million (29.5%) in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the corresponding 2019 periods. The increases were primarily attributable to a new reinsurance contract covering U.S. health insurance risks (approximately $500 million for the first nine months) and from volume growth in the Asian and European life reinsurance markets. The increase in the first nine months was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Life/health underwriting results in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 were negatively affected by increased life benefits from COVID-19-related claim estimates ($68 million in the third quarter and $172 million in the first nine months) and increases in liabilities from changes in underlying assumptions in estimating disability benefit liabilities in Australia. Underwriting results in the first nine months of 2019 included a one-time pre-tax gain of $163 million attributable to a yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract amendment, partially offset by an increase in estimated disability benefit liabilities in Australia. Retroactive reinsurance There were no significant retroactive reinsurance contracts written in the first nine months of 2020 and 2019. Pre-tax underwriting losses in 2020 and 2019 derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments, as well as from foreign currency gains/losses arising from the periodic remeasurement of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities related to contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries. In the first nine months, these contracts had pre-tax foreign currency remeasurement losses of $22 million in 2020 compared to pre-tax gains of $73 million in 2019. Before foreign currency gains/losses, these contracts produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $874 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared to $824 million in the first nine months of 2019. Unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $41.8 billion as of September 30, 2020 and $42.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were $13.0 billion as of September 30, 2020 and $13.7 billion as of December 31, 2019. Deferred charge assets will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned decreased $243 million (37.3%) in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. The periodic payment annuity market is price sensitive. The volume of business written can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments and the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion on annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include the effects of mortality and interest rate changes and remeasurement gains and losses related to foreign currency denominated liabilities of certain contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax foreign currency remeasurement gains in the first nine months were $38 million in 2020 and $70 million in 2019. Excluding foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses were $449 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared to $406 million in the first nine months of 2019. Discounted periodic payment annuity liabilities were $14.0 billion as of September 30, 2020 and $13.5 billion as of December 31, 2019. The weighted average discount rate of these liabilities was 4.0% as of September 30, 2020. 32 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $46 million in the third quarter and pre-tax losses of $83 million in the first nine months of 2020 and pre-tax losses of $18 million in the third quarter and pre-tax earnings of $83 million in the first nine months of 2019. Periodic underwriting results from this business reflect changes in remaining liabilities for underlying guaranteed benefits reinsured, which are affected by changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting results from these contracts can be volatile, reflecting the volatility of securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our recorded liabilities associated with these contracts were approximately $1.6 billion at September 30, 2020. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Interest and other investment income $ 196 $ 556 $ 870 $ 1,646 Dividend income 1,024 1,226 3,610 3,270 Investment income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,220 1,782 4,480 4,916 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 205 298 711 829 Net investment income $ 1,015 $ 1,484 $ 3,769 $ 4,087 Effective income tax rate 16.9 % 16.6 % 15.9 % 16.7 % Interest and other investment income declined $360 million (64.7%) in the third quarter and $776 million (47.1%) in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. The declines were primarily due to lower income from short-term investments. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. Short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and continued to decline through the first half of 2020. The decline in rates resulted in significantly lower interest income in the third quarter of 2020. We expect such rates, which are historically low, to remain low and that our earnings from such investments in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be substantially lower than in 2019. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Dividend income decreased $202 million (16.5%) in the third quarter and increased $340 million (10.4%) in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in the first nine months was primarily attributable to the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% cumulative preferred stock of Occidental on August 8, 2019, partly offset by lower dividends from common stock investments. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, less insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float was approximately $135 billion on September 30, 2020 and $129 billion on December 31, 2019. Our average cost of float was negative for the first nine months of 2020 as our underwriting operations generated pre-tax earnings of $1.2 billion. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 follows (in millions).

Approximately 98% of corporate bond investments were considered investment-grade by the major rating agencies. Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major railroad business groups by type of product shipped which includes consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Railroad operating revenues $ 5,001 $ 5,822 $ 14,698 $ 17,081 Railroad operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 1,105 1,318 3,306 4,011 Fuel 394 725 1,335 2,211 Purchased services 479 518 1,429 1,586 Depreciation and amortization 616 598 1,836 1,778 Equipment rents, materials and other 393 485 1,219 1,537 Total 2,987 3,644 9,125 11,123 Railroad operating earnings 2,014 2,178 5,573 5,958 Other revenues (expenses): Other revenues 175 199 497 595 Other expenses, net (155 ) (165 ) (436 ) (368 ) Interest expense (257 ) (271 ) (779 ) (806 ) Pre-tax earnings 1,777 1,941 4,855 5,379 Income taxes 430 475 1,187 1,322 Net earnings $ 1,347 $ 1,466 $ 3,668 $ 4,057 Effective income tax rate 24.2 % 24.5 % 24.5 % 24.6 % Railroad operating revenues were $5.0 billion in the third quarter and $14.7 billion in the first nine months of 2020, representing decreases of approximately $0.8 billion (14.1%) and $2.4 billion (14.0%), respectively, versus the corresponding periods in 2019. Railroad operating revenues in 2020 reflected lower volumes of 8.3% in the third quarter and 10.5% in the first nine months, as well as a 4.0% year-to-date decrease in average revenue per car/unit resulting from business mix changes and lower fuel surcharge revenue driven by lower fuel prices. Volume in the first nine months of 2020 was 6.88 million cars/units compared to 7.68 million cars/units in 2019. The overall volume decrease was primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted volumes through the first half of the year. While monthly volumes improved sequentially in the third quarter of 2020, volumes continued to be negatively affected by the pandemic. 34 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Pre-tax earnings were $1.8 billion and $4.9 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, decreases of 8.4% and 9.7%, respectively, compared to 2019. The decreases principally resulted from the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on volumes. In addition, pre-tax earnings in the first nine months of 2019 included an operating revenue increase related to the favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing and a retirement plan curtailment gain that is included in other expenses, net in the preceding table. These effects were partially offset by significant improvements in 2020 in service, velocity and cost performance compared to 2019, along with lower costs related to severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network which negatively affected expenses and service levels in 2019. Operating revenues from consumer products were $1.9 billion in the third quarter and $5.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, decreases of 4.5% and 11.2%, respectively, from 2019. The decreases reflected lower average revenue per car/unit for both periods. Volumes increased 0.5% in the third quarter and decreased 6.2% in the first nine months of 2020. Increased retail sales and inventory replenishments by retailers, along with increased e-commerce activity in the third quarter resulted in higher domestic intermodal volumes for the first nine months of 2020. International intermodal volumes and automotive shipments remained low primarily attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.2 billion in the third quarter and $3.8 billion in the first nine months of 2020, decreases of 25.1% and 17.7%, respectively, from 2019. The decreases were attributable to lower volumes of 23.0% in the third quarter and 17.4% in the first nine months of 2020, along with lower average revenue per car/unit in both periods. The volume decreases were primarily driven by a decline in U.S. industrial production due to the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced demand in the energy sector, which drove lower sand and petroleum products volume. Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.2 billion in the third quarter and $3.4 billion in the first nine months of 2020, an increase of 1.7% and decrease of 2.8%, respectively, from 2019. The revenue changes reflected a volume increase of 3.9% in the third quarter and about equal volume in the first nine months of 2020 as compared to 2019, along with lower revenue per car/unit for both periods. The adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on volumes, primarily for ethanol and sweeteners shipments, along with lower soybean exports, were substantially offset by higher grain and meal exports. Operating revenues from coal were $651 million in the third quarter and $2.0 billion in the first nine months of 2020, decreases of 34.6% and 28.7%, respectively, compared to 2019. The decreases reflected lower average revenue per car/unit and lower volume of 25.3% in the third quarter and 22.6% in the first nine months. The volume declines were primarily attributable to lower electricity demand driven by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and mild winter weather in the first quarter, low natural gas prices and utility coal plant retirements. Railroad operating expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 were $3.0 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively, decreases of $0.7 billion (18.0%) and $2.0 billion (18.0%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased 2.9 percentage points to 59.7% in the third quarter and 3.0 percentage points to 62.1% in the first nine months of 2020 versus the 2019 periods. Railroad operating expenses in 2020 reflected lower volume-related costs, productivity improvements, the effects of cost control initiatives and the effects of improved weather conditions compared to 2019. Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $213 million (16.2%) in the third quarter and $705 million (17.6%) in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. The decreases were primarily due to lower employee counts associated with lower volume and improved workforce productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $331 million (45.7%) in the third quarter and $876 million (39.6%) in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. The decreases were primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased service expenses decreased $39 million (7.5%) in the third quarter and $157 million (9.9%) in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower volume, improved productivity and insurance recoveries in the first half of 2020 related to the network flooding in 2019. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses decreased $92 million (19.0%) in the third quarter and $318 million (20.7%) in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019, as a result of lower volume-related costs, the effects of cost controls and lower personal injury expense. BNSF is an important component of the national and global supply chain and, as an essential business, has continued to operate throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant economic disruptions that adversely affected the demand for transportation services. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and the full extent to which it may impact BNSF's business, operating results, financial condition, or liquidity will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. We believe BNSF's fundamental business remains strong and it has ample liquidity to continue business operations during this volatile period. 35 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We currently own 91.1% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. On November 1, 2020, BHE acquired certain natural gas transmission and storage businesses of Dominion Energy, Inc. See Note 22 to accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 4,451 $ 4,337 $ 11,504 $ 11,729 Real estate operating revenue 1,742 1,307 3,828 3,419 Other income (loss) 33 76 60 214 Total revenue 6,226 5,720 15,392 15,362 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 1,169 1,230 3,095 3,471 Energy operating expense 1,952 1,783 5,301 5,115 Real estate operating costs and expense 1,503 1,194 3,492 3,210 Interest expense 480 452 1,430 1,372 Total costs and expense 5,104 4,659 13,318 13,168 Pre-tax earnings 1,122 1,061 2,074 2,194 Income tax expense (benefit)* (412 ) (241 ) (778 ) (451 ) Net earnings after income taxes 1,534 1,302 2,852 2,645 Noncontrolling interests 4 8 11 15 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway Energy 1,530 1,294 2,841 2,630 Noncontrolling interests 135 116 252 240 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 1,395 $ 1,178 $ 2,589 $ 2,390 Effective income tax rate (36.7 )% (22.7 )% (37.5 )% (20.6 )% * Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) PacifiCorp PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. After-tax earnings increased $8 million (2.9%) in the third quarter and $3 million (0.5%) in the first nine months of 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019. The increases reflected higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales), increased production tax credit benefits driven by repowered wind projects placed in-service and higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction, partially offset by higher operating expenses and interest expense. The increases in operating expenses were largely due to costs associated with a settlement agreement and wildfires. Utility margin was $980 million in the third quarter and $2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2020, increases of $77 million and $50 million, respectively, compared to 2019. The increases reflected higher wholesale revenue and lower coal-fueled and natural gas-fueled generation costs, partially offset by lower retail revenue derived from a 1.8% year-to-date decline in customer volumes due to the impacts of COVID-19, partly offset by an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of weather. MidAmerican Energy Company MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased $58 million (20.8%) in the third quarter and $73 million (11.7%) in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. The increases reflected increased income tax benefits, primarily from production tax credits driven primarily by repowered and new wind projects placed in-service, and from higher electric utility margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses, excluding energy efficiency program costs (substantially offset in revenues), and lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction. The increases in operating expenses were largely due to increased storm restoration costs in 2020 and wind projects placed in-service in 2019. Electric utility margin, excluding energy efficiency program revenue, increased $11 million to $603 million in the third quarter and $7 million to $1.4 billion in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. The year-to-date electric utility margin increase was attributable to higher operating revenue from a 1.1% increase in retail customer volumes and lower generation and purchased power costs, partially offset by lower wholesale revenue and price impacts from changes in sales mix. The increase in year-to-date electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to increased usage by certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of COVID-19. NV Energy NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings increased $43 million (20.9%) in the third quarter and $51 million (16.1%) in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the corresponding 2019 periods. The increases reflected higher electric utility margin, higher other income (year-to-date only) and lower income tax expense from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increases in operating expenses were mainly due to higher earnings sharing accruals at Nevada Power Company and higher depreciation expense from additional plant placed in-service. Electric utility margin increased $68 million to $660 million in the third quarter and $80 million to $1.4 billion in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. These increases were primarily due to higher operating revenue from a 0.4% year-to-date increase in electric retail customer volumes, including distribution-only service customers, and price impacts from changes in sales mix. The increase in year-to-date electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather, partially offset by the impacts of COVID-19. Northern Powergrid After-tax earnings decreased $11 million (29.7%) in the third quarter and $9 million (5.0%) in the first nine months of 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decreases reflected higher income tax expense, in large part from a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate, and higher distribution-related operating expenses, partially offset by higher other income. The year-to-date decrease was also partially offset by lower interest expense. Natural gas pipelines After-tax earnings increased $12 million (18.2%) in the third quarter and $26 million (8.8%) in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. These increases were primarily due to higher transportation revenue and the favorable impact of a rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in the first nine months was further offset by increased depreciation, lower storage revenue and higher interest expense. 37 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) Other energy businesses After-tax earnings in the third quarter of 2020 declined $12 million (5.5%) compared to 2019. The decrease reflected the effects of favorable regulatory decisions received in 2019 at AltaLink, L.P. as well as lower operating revenue and higher operating expenses from renewable energy projects in 2020. The decreases were partially offset by increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation. After-tax earnings in the first nine months of 2020 increased $59 million (12.6%) compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to the aforementioned income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, partially offset by lower operating revenue and higher operating expenses from renewable energy projects. Real estate brokerage After-tax earnings increased $95 million in the third quarter and $96 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. The increases reflected significantly higher earnings from mortgage services and brokerage services in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to 2019. The increase in earnings from mortgage services was attributable to higher refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment and the earnings increase from brokerage services was due to a comparative increase in closed units of 12.9% in the third quarter. The year-to-date earnings increase was partially offset by an unfavorable contingent earn-out remeasurement on a previous business acquisition. Corporate interest and other After-tax earnings increased $43 million (33.9%) in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher federal income tax credits recognized, partially offset by higher operating expenses and interest expense. After-tax earnings decreased $88 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to state income tax benefits recognized in 2019, higher interest expense, higher operating expenses and lower cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies, partially offset by higher federal income tax credits recognized. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months Revenues Earnings * Revenues Earnings * 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Manufacturing $ 15,170 $ 15,897 $ 2,255 $ 2,484 $ 43,238 $ 47,173 $ 5,765 $ 7,205 Service and retailing 19,319 19,982 875 689 55,351 59,079 1,950 2,225 $ 34,489 $ 35,879 $ 98,589 $ 106,252 Pre-tax earnings 3,130 3,173 7,715 9,430 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 784 718 1,882 2,288 $ 2,346 $ 2,455 $ 5,833 $ 7,142 Effective income tax rate 24.4 % 22.1 % 24.0 % 23.7 % * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which were primarily from the amortization of identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings in the preceding table were $195 million in the third quarter and $593 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared to $201 million in the third quarter and $581 million in the first nine months of 2019. In the first nine months of 2020, such expenses also exclude after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $10.4 billion. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page 27 and in the “Other” earnings section on page 44. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. The industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (“CTB”)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (“LSPI”)). Marmon includes UTLX Company (“UTLX”), which provides various products and services (including equipment leasing) for the rail and mobile crane industries. 38 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Manufacturing (Continued) The building products group includes homebuilding and manufactured housing finance (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months Revenues Pre-tax earnings Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Industrial products $ 6,173 $ 7,716 $ 940 $ 1,458 $ 19,320 $ 23,280 $ 2,781 $ 4,441 Building products 5,672 5,281 825 696 15,497 15,212 2,088 1,904 Consumer products 3,325 2,900 490 330 8,421 8,681 896 860 $ 15,170 $ 15,897 $ 2,255 $ 2,484 $ 43,238 $ 47,173 $ 5,765 $ 7,205 Industrial products Revenues of the industrial products group were $6.2 billion in the third quarter and $19.3 billion in the first nine months of 2020, decreases of 20.0% in the third quarter and 17.0% in the first nine months from comparable 2019 periods. Pre-tax earnings of the group were $940 million in the third quarter and $2.8 billion in the first nine months of 2020, declines of 35.6% in the third quarter and 37.4% in the first nine months compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 14.4% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 19.1% in 2019. Revenues and earnings were generally lower across each of our industrial products businesses. PCC’s revenues were $1.5 billion in the third quarter and $5.7 billion in the first nine months of 2020, decreases of 41.4% from the third quarter and 26.7% from the first nine months of 2019. Since March of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and aircraft production. Airlines responded to the pandemic by delaying delivery of aircraft orders or, in some cases, cancelling aircraft orders, resulting in significant reductions in build rates by aircraft manufacturers and significant inventory reduction initiatives being implemented by PCC’s customers. Further, Boeing’s ongoing 737 MAX aircraft production issues have contributed to the declines in aerospace product sales in 2020. These factors resulted in significant declines in demand for PCC’s aerospace products in 2020. PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 declined 80% in the third quarter and 70% in the first nine months as compared to 2019. These decreases reflected the declines in aerospace products sales, which contributed to reduced manufacturing efficiencies. PCC management continues to undertake aggressive restructuring actions to resize operations in response to reduced expected volumes in aerospace markets. During the first nine months of 2020, PCC significantly reduced its worldwide workforce and expects that by the end of 2020, its workforce will be about 40% lower than at the end of 2019. PCC recorded charges for restructuring and inventory and fixed asset write-downs of approximately $300 million in the first nine months of 2020. Although earnings as a percentage of revenues are expected to continue to be negatively impacted through 2020 due to inefficiencies associated with aligning operations to reduced aircraft build rates, management expects the actions being taken will ultimately improve operations and increase operating margins from the current depressed levels. Lubrizol’s revenues were $1.5 billion in the third quarter and $4.4 billion in the first nine months of 2020, decreases of 8.7% from the third quarter and 12.5% from the first nine months of 2019. The declines were primarily attributable to lower volumes resulting from the worldwide economic impacts of COVID-19 and the effects of a fire at an additives manufacturing, blending and storage facility in Rouen, France at the end of the third quarter of 2019. While the Rouen operations were well below historical levels through the first nine months of 2020, production capacities are now substantially restored. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume declined 8.3% in the third quarter and 13.0% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting declines in the Additives and Engineered Materials product lines, partly offset by higher volumes in Life Science products. 39 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings increased 11.2% in the third quarter and decreased 14.7% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The comparative increase in the third quarter reflected the effects of lower raw material costs and operating expenses more than offsetting lower sales volumes and average selling prices, as the negative effects from the Rouen fire were largely offset by insurance recoveries. The decline for the first nine months was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes, the impact of the Rouen fire, lower average selling prices and effects from foreign currency translation. These negative impacts were partially offset by lower average raw material costs and lower operating expenses. Marmon’s revenues were $2.0 billion in the third quarter and $5.7 billion in the first nine months of 2020, decreases of 6.2% from the third quarter and 9.4% from the first nine months of 2019. In the third quarter of 2020, excluding acquisitions, revenues decreased in almost all of Marmon’s sectors due to lower volumes, primarily attributable to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the largest effects experienced in the Transportation Products and Foodservice Technologies sectors. Additionally, revenues in the first nine months of 2020 decreased due to lower metal prices in the Electrical, Metals Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration sectors and the effect of 2019 divestitures. The drastic declines in oil prices in 2020 also adversely affected volumes and revenues in the Crane, Electrical, Water and Rail & Leasing sectors. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings decreased 19.3% in the third quarter and 18.1% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The decreases reflected the declines in revenues, increased restructuring charges and lower interest income. We expect additional restructuring initiatives through the end of 2020 in response to the lower product demand, particularly in the sectors most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. IMC’s revenues were $699 million in the third quarter and $2.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, decreases of 17.8% from the third quarter and 16.3% from the first nine months of 2019. The revenue declines were attributable to the negative economic effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects in the first half of 2020, partly offset by the effects of business acquisitions over the past year. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 32.3% in the third quarter and 35.9% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The earnings declines were primarily due to the declines in sales and changes in sales mix. Building products Revenues of the building products group were $5.7 billion in the third quarter and $15.5 billion in the first nine months of 2020, increases of $391 million (7.4%) from the third quarter and $285 million (1.9%) from the first nine months of 2019. Pre-tax earnings of the group were $825 million in the third quarter and $2.1 billion in the first nine months of 2020, increases of 18.5% from the third quarter and 9.7% from the first nine months of 2019. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.5% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 12.5% in the first nine months of 2019. Clayton Homes’ revenues were $2.3 billion in the third quarter and $6.1 billion in the first nine months of 2020, increases of 22.4% over the third quarter and 14.7% over the first nine months of 2019. The comparative increases were primarily due to increases in home sales of 24.6% in the third quarter and 15.5% in the first nine months, reflecting a net increase in units sold and changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 29% in the first nine months of 2020, while manufactured home unit sales increased 1%. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 15.7% in the third quarter and 12.5% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were $16.4 billion as of September 30, 2020 compared to $15.9 billion as of December 31, 2019. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $339 million in the third quarter and $859 million in the first nine months of 2020, increases of 24.7% in the third quarter and 11.7% in the first nine months compared to the same periods in 2019. The earnings increases reflected higher earnings from home building, increased interest income, lower interest expense and higher earnings from mortgage services, partly offset by increased provisions for credit losses and insurance losses. Although loan delinquency rates at the end of September 2020 were below those at the end of September 2019, the credit loss provisions in 2020 reflect expected credit losses, including the estimated impacts on the economy and unemployment rates arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were $3.4 billion in the third quarter and $9.4 billion in the first nine months of 2020, decreases of 1.0% in the third quarter and 5.1% in the first nine months compared to the same periods in 2019. The revenue decreases reflected lower volumes in certain commercial and industrial markets attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by increased paint and coatings volumes from a new agreement with Ace Hardware Stores and increased volumes in the residential markets. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were $486 million in the third quarter and $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, increases of 14.8% from the third quarter and 8.3% from the first nine months of 2019. The earnings increases reflected the effects of lower average input costs, operating cost containment efforts and lower facilities closure costs. 40 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Consumer products Consumer products revenues were $3.3 billion in the third quarter and $8.4 billion in the first nine months of 2020, an increase of 14.7% in the third quarter and a decrease of 3.0% in the first nine months compared to the same periods in 2019. Forest River sales increased 38.5% in the third quarter and 2.4% in the first nine months of 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019. The increase in the third quarter was attributable to a significant increase in recreational vehicle unit sales and changes in sales mix. Apparel and footwear sales in the third quarter of 2020 were relatively unchanged from the third quarter of 2019 and decreased 10.9% in the first nine months as compared to 2019. Sales volumes in the first half of 2020, particularly in the second quarter, reflected the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which included retail store closures, reduced or cancelled orders and pandemic-related disruptions at certain of our manufacturing facilities. Apparel and footwear sales in the third quarter of 2020 exceeded the second quarter of 2020 by 59%, attributable to a higher consumer demand and from retail customers restocking their inventories. Brooks Sports year-to-date revenues in 2020 were higher, partly attributable to the effect of lower sales in the first nine months of 2019 caused by product shipping delays at a new distribution facility. Revenues from Duracell in the first nine months of 2020 also increased over 2019. Consumer products pre-tax earnings were $490 million in the third quarter and $896 million in the first nine months of 2020, increases of 48.5% in the third quarter and 4.2% in the first nine months compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the first nine months were 10.6% in 2020 and 9.9% in 2019. The increase in pre-tax earnings for the third quarter was primarily attributable to Forest River and Duracell, and to a lesser extent from apparel and footwear. Earnings in the first nine months of 2020 included lower earnings from apparel and footwear products and increased earnings from Duracell. Earnings from Forest River were relatively unchanged in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months Revenues Pre-tax earnings Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Service $ 3,068 $ 3,341 $ 470 $ 451 $ 9,093 $ 10,195 $ 1,155 $ 1,425 Retailing 4,211 4,037 309 188 11,179 11,670 590 580 McLane Company 12,040 12,604 96 50 35,079 37,214 205 220 $ 19,319 $ 19,982 $ 875 $ 689 $ 55,351 $ 59,079 $ 1,950 $ 2,225 Service Our service business group offers fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and professional aviation training services and flight simulation products (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI), franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen) and offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG) and until the time of their sale on March 16, 2020, the publishing of newspapers. Service group revenues were $3.1 billion in the third quarter and $9.1 billion in the first nine months of 2020, decreases of 8.2% in the third quarter and 10.8% in the first nine months as compared to 2019. The aggregate revenues of NetJets and FlightSafety declined 10.8% in the third quarter and 14.3% for the first nine months of 2020, reflecting lower demand for aviation services as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, TTI’s revenues increased 2.4% in the third quarter and decreased 1.2% in the first nine months of 2020 as compared with 2019. The comparative revenue declines in 2020 also included a year-to-date decline of 29.2% at CORT, as well as the effects of the disposition of the newspaper operations in March. Pre-tax earnings of the service group were $470 million in the third quarter and $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, an increase of $19 million (4.2%) in the third quarter and a decrease of $270 million (18.9%) in the first nine months compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 12.7% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 14.0% in 2019. The decline in earnings for the first nine months of 2020 was primarily attributable to FlightSafety, NetJets, TTI and CORT. TTI’s earnings decline reflected lower average gross margin rates, attributable to sluggish sales volumes in certain markets and sales price pressures deriving from ample inventory availability within the industry. The declines at NetJets, FlightSafety and CORT were due to lower customer demand for services and increased asset impairment and restructuring charges in the aviation services businesses. 41 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”), which consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products, and represented about 65% of our combined retailing revenues in 2020. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Other retailing businesses include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics and represented about 20% of the combined retailing revenues in 2020. Other retailing businesses also include three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories. Retailing group revenues were $4.2 billion in the third quarter and $11.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, an increase of 4.3% in the third quarter and a decrease of 4.2% in the first nine months compared to 2019. The spread of COVID-19 throughout the U.S. resulted in the temporary closures or restricted operations at some of our retail store operations during 2020 and significantly lower sales in the first half of the year. The severity and duration of the effects on our operations from the pandemic have varied widely. Sales volumes increased and operating results improved beginning in the latter part of the second quarter as our operations slowly reopened. BHA’s revenues decreased 2.5% in the third quarter and 4.9% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. BHA’s revenues in 2020 reflected decreases in new and pre-owned vehicle sales of 2.4% in the third quarter and 5.0% in the first nine months as well as lower vehicle service and repair revenues. Home furnishings group revenues in 2020 increased 8.5% in the third quarter versus 2019, reflecting stronger consumer demand. Home furnishings revenues decreased 4.9% in the first nine months of 2020 as compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings of the retail group were $309 million in the third quarter and $590 million in the first nine months of 2020, increases of 64.4% in the third quarter and 1.7% in the first nine months from 2019. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 50.3% in the third quarter and 30.8% in the first nine months of 2020, primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower floorplan interest expense and from higher gross margin rates. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $66 million in the third quarter and decreased $82 million in the first nine months of 2020 as compared to 2019. Certain of our smaller operations, including Pampered Chef and Louis experienced significant earnings increases in 2020, while others, including See’s Candy and Oriental Trading Company, experienced significant declines. Also, we incurred charges in the first nine months of 2020 attributable to asset impairments, restructurings and credit losses. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised about 2/3 of McLane’s consolidated sales in the first nine months of 2020 with foodservice comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues were $12.0 billion in the third quarter and $35.1 billion in the first nine months of 2020, decreases of 4.5% in the third quarter and 5.7% in the first nine months compared to 2019. Revenues in the third quarter of 2020 decreased 4.7% in the grocery business (5.4% year-to-date) and 5.2% in the foodservice business (7.7% year-to-date) as compared to 2019. The declines were attributable to COVID-19 related restaurant closures (particularly in the casual dining category) in the foodservice business and lower sales in certain product categories within the grocery business. Pre-tax earnings increased $46 million (92.0%) in the third quarter and decreased $15 million (6.8%) in the first nine months of 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings increase in the third quarter reflected ongoing operating expense management efforts and a slight increase in the overall gross margin rate, partly offset by the effects of lower sales. The earnings decrease in the first nine months of 2020 included charges of $23 million for credit and inventory losses in the foodservice operations and the impact of lower sales. McLane continues to operate in an intensely competitive business environment, which is negatively affecting its current operating results. 42 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains/losses follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Investment gains/losses $ 31,625 $ 10,692 $ 2,032 $ 40,079 Derivative gains/losses (43 ) 234 (640 ) 1,217 Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 31,582 10,926 1,392 41,296 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 6,845 2,260 627 8,590 Net gains/losses $ 24,737 $ 8,666 $ 765 $ 32,706 Effective income tax rate 21.3 % 20.8 % 35.1 % 20.8 % Investment gains/losses We are required to include the unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains/losses in 2020 included net unrealized gains of $30.8 billion in the third quarter and $16.5 billion in the first nine months on securities we owned on September 30. Net unrealized gains in 2019 on securities owned on September 30, 2019 were $10.5 billion in the third quarter and $39.5 billion in the first nine months. Investment losses from market value changes in the first nine months of 2020 on equity securities sold in 2020 were $13.9 billion. In 2020, taxable investment gains on equity securities sold, which is the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $3.9 billion in the third quarter and $0.7 billion in the first nine months. In 2019, taxable investment gains on equity securities sold were $0.6 billion in the third quarter and $2.0 billion in the first nine months. Investment gains/losses from periodic changes in securities prices will continue to cause significant volatility in our consolidated earnings. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe that the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. Substantially all remaining contracts will expire by February 2023. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant due to the volatility of market prices in the underlying equity markets. As of September 30, 2020, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was approximately $1.2 billion and our recorded liability at fair value was $1.5 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. 43 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Equity method earnings $ 244 $ 515 $ 346 $ 812 Acquisition accounting expenses (195 ) (201 ) (593 ) (581 ) Goodwill and intangible asset impairments (19 ) — (10,369 ) — Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (80 ) (63 ) (252 ) (209 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes (412 ) 308 (329 ) 355 Income tax expense adjustments (60 ) — (60 ) (377 ) Other, principally corporate investment income 32 276 363 694 Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ (490 ) $ 835 $ (10,894 ) $ 694 After-tax equity method earnings include Berkshire’s share of earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. Our Kraft Heinz investment produced after-tax earnings of $142 million for the third quarter and an after-tax loss of $56 million for the first nine months of 2020. The after-tax loss in the first nine months included $611 million attributable to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz (primarily in the second quarter). As discussed in Note 5 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, financial results of Kraft Heinz for the first and second quarters of 2019 were not available to us until the third quarter. Accordingly, our consolidated statements of earnings for the third quarter of 2019 included our share of Kraft Heinz’s earnings for the first nine months, or $377 million, which included $214 million attributable to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the first nine months of 2020 included charges of $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets that were recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. See Critical Accounting Policies on page 46 for additional details. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and BHFC. As of September 30, 2020, outstanding borrowings included senior notes of €6.85 billion par, ¥625.5 billion par and £1.75 billion par. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce non-cash unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The income tax expense adjustments relate to investments that we made between 2015 and 2018 in certain tax equity investment funds, which aggregated approximately $340 million. In December 2018 and during the first quarter of 2019, we learned of allegations by federal authorities of fraudulent income conduct by the sponsor of these funds and in January 2020, the principals involved in creating the investment funds plead guilty to criminal charges related to the sale of the investments. In the first quarter of 2019, we concluded it was more likely than not that the income tax benefits that we recognized prior to 2019 were not valid. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2020 was $415.2 billion, a decrease of $9.6 billion since December 31, 2019 and an increase of $21.7 billion since June 30, 2020. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders were $30.1 billion in the third quarter and $6.7 billion in the first nine months of 2020. Earnings included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $24.8 billion in the third quarter and $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2020. Changes in the market prices for our investments in equity securities since December 31, 2019 have produced exceptional volatility in our earnings. Our results in 2020 also included after-tax goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $11.0 billion. At September 30, 2020, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills (net of amounts payable as of September 30 for purchases that were settled in October) of $135.2 billion, which included $114.1 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $264.8 billion. 44 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition (Continued) Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at September 30, 2020 was $22.2 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion since December 31, 2019. In the first nine months of 2020, Berkshire repaid maturing senior notes of €1.0 billion and issued €1.0 billion of 0.0% senior notes due in 2025 and ¥195.5 billion of senior notes (approximately $1.8 billion), which has a weighted average interest rate of 1.07% and maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2060. In the first quarter of 2021, senior notes of $1.6 billion will mature. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $16.7 billion at September 30, 2020, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $11.0 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our UTLX railcar leasing business. In the first nine months of 2020, BHFC repaid $350 million of maturing senior notes and issued $500 million of 1.85% senior notes due in 2030. In October 2020, BHFC repaid $550 million of maturing senior notes and issued $2.5 billion of senior notes, consisting of $750 million of 1.45% senior notes due in 2030 and $1.75 billion of 2.85% senior notes due in 2050. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. In the first quarter of 2021, approximately $750 million of BHFC senior notes will mature. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of these two operations in the first nine months of 2020 were $7.1 billion and we currently forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $3 billion over the remainder of 2020. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.2 billion as of September 30, 2020, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2019. In April 2020, BNSF issued $575 million of 3.05% senior unsecured debentures due in 2051. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $45.6 billion at September 30, 2020, an increase of approximately $3.0 billion since December 31, 2019. In the first nine months of 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new term debt aggregating $5.5 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2062, repaid approximately $1.9 billion of debt and reduced short-term borrowings. Over the remainder of 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries will repay debt of approximately $640 million. On October 29, 2020, BHE issued $500 million of 1.65% senior notes due in 2031 and $1.5 billion of 2.85% senior notes due in 2051. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. In July 2020, BHE reached a definitive agreement with Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) to acquire substantially all of Dominion’s natural gas transmission and storage businesses. As discussed in Note 22 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, on November 1, 2020, BHE acquired certain of the Dominion businesses for $2.7 billion in cash and assumed $5.3 billion of Dominion debt. The acquisition of the remainder of the Dominion businesses is expected to close in early 2021. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program was amended on July 17, 2018, permitting Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In the first nine months of 2020, Berkshire paid $15.7 billion, including $9.0 billion in the third quarter, to repurchase shares of Class A and B common stock. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future are not currently reflected in the financial statements, which will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the first nine months of 2020, Berkshire and its subsidiaries issued new term debt. Principal and interest payments associated with these new term borrowings are expected as follows: in 2020 – $82 million; in 2021 and 2022 – $472 million; in 2023 and 2024 – $1.0 billion; and thereafter – $12.2 billion. In October 2020, Berkshire subsidiaries issued new term debt aggregating $4.5 billion with maturities ranging from 2030 to 2051. 45 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations (Continued) Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2020 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in the “Contractual Obligations” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2020 includes estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts of $119.8 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2020 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $71.9 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2019. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. In response to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we considered whether goodwill needed to be reevaluated for impairment. As of June 30, 2020, we determined it was necessary to quantitively reevaluate goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and most significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million in the second quarter of 2020, of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC. Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of our goodwill in PCC was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets in PCC was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of these amounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. We believe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers is particularly severe. We considered a number of factors in our reevaluation, including but not limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand, employment levels and aircraft orders, announcements by manufactures on reduced aircraft production, and the actions we are taking or may take to restructure our operations to fit lower expected demand. In our judgment, the timing and extent of the recovery in the commercial airline and aerospace industries may be dependent on the development and wide-scale distribution of medicines or vaccines that effectively treat the virus. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase the discount rates and reduce our prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing for impairments. The amounts of these adjustments were based on qualitative assessments by Berkshire. As of September 30, 2020, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units and judgments on goodwill impairments at this time are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on the reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could prove to be worse than we currently estimate for our reporting units, including reporting units where we recorded impairment charges during the first nine months of 2020, and could lead us to record additional goodwill or indefinite-lived asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2020. 46 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations, the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of September 30, 2020, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 47 Part II Other Information Item 1A. Risk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 to which reference is made herein. T hese risk factors are supplemented for the items described below . The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses. The outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks may adversely affect, our operations, including our equity securities portfolio. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses. Unfavorable general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital markets at a reasonable cost. Our operating businesses are subject to economic conditions affecting the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate. To the extent that economic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide are depressed by the effects of COVID-19 or otherwise, one or more of our significant operations could be materially harmed. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures, and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the third quarter of 2020 follows.

General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Changes to those policies due to the adoption of new accounting standards are described in Note 2. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, changes in the fair values of certain derivative contract liabilities, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the magnitude of asset impairment charges can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread rapidly across the world in the first quarter of 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in March and adversely affected nearly all of our operations in the second quarter, although such effects vary significantly. The duration and extent of the effects over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The risks and uncertainties resulting from the pandemic that may affect our future earnings, cash flows and financial condition include the nature and duration of the curtailment or closure of our various facilities and the long-term effect on the demand for our products and services. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Additionally, GEICO’s underwriting results will likely be negatively affected over the remainder of the year and in the first quarter of 2021 as the full impact of the GEICO Giveback program (a program whereby auto insurance policies renewed and newly issued during the period between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020 receive a 15 % premium rate reduction) will be reflected in earned premiums during these periods. Note 2. New accounting pronouncements We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January 1, 2020 . ASC 326 provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried at amortized cost based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses therefore include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. We elected to not measure an allowance for expected credit losses on accrued interest and instead reverse uncollectible accrued interest through interest income on a timely basis. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a charge to retained earnings of $ 388 million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses, which was primarily related to our manufactured housing loans. Expected credit losses for such financial assets are based on the net present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of expected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality indicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates, historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans, the historical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other matters. In addition, our estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 7 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2. New accounting pronouncements (Continued) Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables are primarily short-term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination. In establishing credit loss allowances for such receivables, we primarily utilize credit loss history. However, credit loss allowances may be adjusted as a result of current conditions and when we expect reasonable and supportable forecasts to deviate from historical experience. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses, we review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider credit ratings, right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement including, collateral, funds held arrangements, guarantees and other publicly available information. We adopted ASU 2017-04 “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” as of January 1, 2020 . Under ASU 2017-04, the measurement of a goodwill impairment is represented by the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the reporting unit and is limited to the carrying value of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after its adoption date. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts.” ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used to value policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs arising from long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts, with the effects of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount rate assumptions reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 3.

Investments in equity securities Investments in equity securities as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are summarized based on the primary industry of the investee in the tables below (in millions). Cost Basis Net Unrealized Gains Fair Value June 30, 2020* Banks, insurance and finance $ 31,164 $ 28,081 $ 59,245 Consumer products 38,706 73,990 112,696 Commercial, industrial and other 26,193 9,320 35,513 $ 96,063 $ 111,391 $ 207,454 * Approximately 71 % of the aggregate fair value was concentrated in four companies (American Express Company – $ 14.4 billion; Apple Inc. – $ 91.5 billion; Bank of America Corporation – $ 22.6 billion and The Coca-Cola Company – $ 17.9 billion).

On August 8, 2019, Berkshire invested a total of $ 10 billion in Occidental Corporation (“Occidental”) newly issued Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $ 10 billion, and warrants to purchase up to 80 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $ 62.50 per share. In accordance with the terms of the warrants, on August 3, 2020, the number of shares of common stock that can be purchased was increased to 83.86 million shares and the exercise price was reduced to $ 59.62 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8 % per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing on the tenth anniversary of issuance at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, or mandatorily under certain specified capital return events. Dividends on the preferred stock may be paid in cash or, at Occidental’s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. Our investments in Occidental are included in the commercial, industrial and other category in the preceding tables. Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 325,442,152 shares of Kraft Heinz common stock representing 26.6 % of the outstanding shares. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $ 10.4 billion at June 30, 2020 and $ 10.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $ 13.1 billion at June 30, 2020 and $ 13.8 billion at December 31, 2019. As disclosed in Berkshire’s Form 10-Qs for the first three quarters of 2019, Kraft Heinz’s financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2019 were not available until August 13, 2019 when Kraft Heinz filed financial statements for those periods with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Thus, Berkshire did not record equity method earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz for each of those periods until the third quarter of 2019. Our equity method losses for the second quarter and first six months of 2020 were $ 440 million and $ 339 million, respectively, which included approximately $ 750 million representing our proportionate share of the goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz in the second quarter. We received dividends on the common stock of $ 260 million in each of the first six months of 2020 and 2019, which were recorded as reductions to the carrying value of our investment. 9 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5. Equity method investments (Continued) As of June 30, 2020, the carrying value of our investment in Kraft Heinz exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by $ 2.7 billion ( 20.6 %). In light of that fact, we evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. We utilize no bright-line tests in such evaluations. Based on the available facts and information regarding the operating results of Kraft Heinz, our ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery, the relative amount of the decline, and the length of time that fair value was less than carrying value, we concluded that recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required. However, we will continue to monitor this investment and it is possible that an impairment loss will be recorded in earnings in future periods based on changes in facts and circumstances or intentions. Summarized consolidated financial information of Kraft Heinz follows (in millions). June 27, 2020 December 28, 2019 Assets $ 98,306 $ 101,450 Liabilities 49,141 49,701 Second Quarter First Six Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Sales $ 6,648 $ 6,406 $ 12,805 $ 12,365 Net earnings (loss) attributable to Kraft Heinz common shareholders* ( 1,651 ) 449 ( 1,273 ) 854 * Includes goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment charges of approximately $ 2.6 billion and $ 500 million during the second quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 2.8 billion and $ 1.1 billion during the first six months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”) and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”). The carrying value of our investments in these entities was approximately $ 4.0 billion as of June 30, 2020 and $ 3.7 billion as of December 31, 2019. Our equity method earnings from these entities in the first six months were $ 382 million in 2020 and $ 314 million in 2019. Additional information concerning these investments follows. We own a 50 % interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50 % interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through its issuance of commercial paper, which is currently limited to $ 1.5 billion. On June 30, 2020, Berkadia’s commercial paper outstanding was $ 1.47 billion. The commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. In addition, a Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company subsidiary owns a 50 % interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint. American Electric Power owns the other 50 % interest. In 2017, we acquired a 38.6 % interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North America, supplying more than 11 billion gallons of fuel per year via more than 950 retail locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces and through wholesale distribution. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1 % interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining 11.3 % interest. We also entered into an agreement to acquire in 2023 an additional 41.4 % interest in Pilot with the Haslam family retaining a 20 % interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023. 10 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 6. Investment gains/losses Investment gains/losses in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows (in millions).

In the first six months of 2020 and 2019, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $ 15.7 billion and $ 4.5 billion, respectively, from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains/losses on equity securities sold reflect the difference between proceeds from sales and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable quarterly or annual period or the purchase date, if later. The losses on securities sold in the first six months of 2020 ($ 11.2 billion) include losses of $ 10.7 billion from market value changes in the first quarter on securities that were sold in the second quarter. Our taxable gains/losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Taxable losses were $ 4.5 billion and $ 3.3 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2020, respectively, and taxable gains were $ 832 million and $ 1.35 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively.

The outstanding loan under the facility was approximately $ 1.6 billion as of both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and is secured by mortgages on real estate properties. In the first quarter of 2020, we provided a loan of $ 576 million to Lee Enterprises, Inc. in connection with its acquisition of our newspaper operations and the repayment of its then outstanding credit facilities. We are the sole lender to each of these entities and each of these loans is current as to payment status. Note 8.

Goodwill and other intangible assets (Continued) Intangible asset amortization expense in the first six months was $ 647 million in 2020 and $ 658 million in 2019. Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $ 18.3 billion as of June 30, 2020 and $ 19.0 billion as of December 31, 2019 and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. During the second quarter of 2020, we concluded it was necessary to reevaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of certain of our reporting units for impairment due to the disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe the most significant of these disruptions relate to the air travel and commercial aerospace and supporting industries. We recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of approximately $ 10 billion and pre-tax indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $ 638 million in the second quarter of 2020. Approximately $ 10 billion of these charges related to Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), the largest business within Berkshire's manufacturing segment. The carrying value of PCC-related goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets prior to the impairment charges was approximately $ 31 billion. The amounts of the impairment charges were determined based on discounted cash flow methods and reflect our current assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with the aerospace industry. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results in the future may vary significantly from the forecasts. The COVID-19 pandemic events will continue to evolve and the effects on our businesses may differ from what we currently estimate. If the effects prove to be worse than is reflected in our current estimates, additional goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges could be required. Note 13. Derivative contracts We are party to derivative contracts through certain of our subsidiaries. The most significant derivative contracts consist of equity index put option contracts. The liabilities and related notional values of these contracts follow (in millions). Liabilities Notional Value June 30, 2020 $ 1,565 $ 14,348 December 31, 2019 968 14,385 The equity index put option contracts are European style options written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. Notional value in the preceding table represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming the value of each index is zero at each contract’s expiration date. Certain contracts are denominated in foreign currencies and the related notional amounts are based on the foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. These contracts generated pre-tax gains of $ 796 million in the second quarter and pre-tax losses of $ 597 million in the first six months of 2020. Equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax gains of $ 213 million and $ 983 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively. The losses in the first six months of 2020 reflected declines in index values between December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2020. Substantially all open contracts as of June 30, 2020 will expire by February 2023 . The weighted average life of unexpired contracts at June 30, 2020 was approximately 1.3 years. Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike price at the expiration date. We received aggregate premiums of $ 2.5 billion on the contract inception dates with respect to unexpired contracts as of June 30, 2020 and we have no counterparty credit risk. The aggregate intrinsic value (the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date) was $ 1.2 billion at June 30, 2020 and $ 397 million at December 31, 2019. These contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the expiration dates and the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses will not be determined until the contract expiration dates. Our regulated utility subsidiaries are exposed to variations in the prices of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity purchased and sold and natural gas supplied for customers. We may use forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options to manage a portion of these price risks. Most of the net derivative contract assets or liabilities of our regulated utilities are probable of recovery through rates and are offset by regulatory liabilities or assets. 15 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 15), for each of the six months ending June 30, 2020 and 2019 follows (in millions). 2020 2019 Balances – beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 73,019 $ 68,458 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 2,855 ) ( 3,060 ) Net liabilities 70,164 65,398 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events 20,278 20,127 Prior accident years’ events 189 71 Total incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 20,467 20,198 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events ( 6,638 ) ( 7,724 ) Prior accident years’ events ( 11,155 ) ( 10,243 ) Total payments ( 17,793 ) ( 17,967 ) Foreign currency translation adjustment ( 78 ) 3 Balances – June 30: Net liabilities 72,760 67,632 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 2,909 3,149 Gross liabilities $ 75,669 $ 70,781 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the preceding table were recorded in earnings in each period and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). In the first six months, we recorded net increases in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 189 million in 2020 compared to $ 71 million in 2019, which produced corresponding increases in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. These increases, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 0.3 % in 2020 and 0.1 % in 2019. In the first six months of 2020 and 2019, we reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events for primary insurance by $ 250 million and $ 198 million, respectively. The decreases were primarily attributable to lower than anticipated private passenger automobile, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims. The decrease in 2019 was partially offset by increased liabilities for legacy casualty exposures and other commercial insurance business. We increased estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to reinsurance assumed by $ 439 million and $ 269 million in the first six months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in 2020 included increased liabilities for legacy casualty exposures. 16 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract inception date or, when applicable, once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the six months ending June 30, 2020 and 2019 follow (in millions). 2020 2019 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Balances – beginning of year $ 42,441 $ ( 13,747 ) $ 41,834 $ ( 14,104 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current year contracts — — 175 ( 82 ) Prior years’ contracts 24 554 — 552 Total 24 554 175 470 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 628 ) — ( 460 ) — Balances – June 30 $ 41,837 $ ( 13,193 ) $ 41,549 $ ( 13,634 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 578 $ 645 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months related to contracts written in prior years were $ 578 million in 2020 and $ 552 million in 2019. Such losses reflected the recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effects of changes in the timing and amount of projected future loss payments. Berkshire’s subsidiary, National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), is party to a contract with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”), in which NICO’s ultimate liability is contractually limited to $ 20 billion. Our estimated ultimate claim liabilities with respect to the AIG contract at both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were $ 18.2 billion. Deferred charge assets related to the AIG contract were approximately $ 6.0 billion at June 30, 2020 and $ 6.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Note 16. Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (dollars in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of June 30, 2020. Weighted Average Interest Rate June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Insurance and other: Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) In March 2020, Berkshire repaid € 1.0 billion of maturing senior notes and issued € 1.0 billion of 0.0 % senior notes due in 2025 . In the first quarter of 2021, $ 1.6 billion of senior notes will mature. In April 2020, Berkshire issued ¥ 195.5 billion (approximately $ 1.8 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2060 and a weighted average interest rate of 1.07 %. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In January 2020, BHFC repaid $ 350 million of maturing senior notes and in March 2020 issued $ 500 million of 1.85 % senior notes due in 2030 . The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 6.85 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 625.5 billion par) reflect the applicable foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $ 102 million in the first six months of 2020 and $ 64 million in the first six months of 2019. In addition to BHFC borrowings, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $ 1.2 billion of other subsidiary borrowings at June 30, 2020. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. Weighted Average Interest Rate June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2021 - 2050 4.5 % $ 11,461 $ 8,581 Subsidiary and other debt due 2020 - 2064 4.3 % 31,444 30,772 Short-term borrowings 1.6 % 2,289 3,214 Burlington Northern Santa Fe and subsidiaries due 2020 - 2097 4.6 % 23,252 23,211 $ 68,446 $ 65,778 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. During the first six months of 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new term debt of approximately $ 5.3 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2062 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.5 %. In the first six months of 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries repaid $ 1.8 billion of debt and reduced short-term borrowings by $ 920 million. BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In April 2020, BNSF issued $ 575 million of 3.05 % senior unsecured debentures due in 2051 . During the first six months of 2020, BNSF repaid $ 531 million of debt. As of June 30, 2020, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2020, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $ 9.3 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included approximately $ 7.4 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 18 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 17. Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, other receivables and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of their fair values.

Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 follow (in millions). Gains (losses) included in: Balance – beginning of year Earnings Other comprehensive income Regulatory assets and liabilities Acquisitions, dispositions and settlements Balance – June 30 Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities: 2020 $ 10,407 $ ( 2,469 ) $ — $ — $ — $ 7,938 2019 7 — — — ( 2 ) 5 Net derivative contract liabilities: 2020 ( 857 ) ( 265 ) — ( 56 ) ( 265 ) ( 1,443 ) 2019 ( 2,343 ) 1,134 ( 1 ) ( 23 ) ( 128 ) ( 1,361 ) Quantitative information as of June 30, 2020 with respect to significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follows (dollars in millions). Fair Value Principal Valuation Techniques Unobservable Inputs Weighted Average Investments in equity securities: Preferred stock $ 7,878 Discounted cash flow Expected duration 9 years Discount for transferability restrictions and subordination 375 basis points Common stock warrants 57 Warrant pricing model Expected duration 9 years Volatility 28 % Derivative contract liabilities 1,565 Option pricing model Volatility 21 % As described in Note 4, our investments in Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Occidental Preferred”) and Occidental common stock warrants were acquired at an aggregate cost of $ 10 billion. Investments in equity securities in the preceding table include our investments in Occidental Preferred and Occidental common stock warrants. These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. In applying discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the Occidental Preferred, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. The Occidental Preferred is redeemable at Occidental’s option beginning in 2029 . In valuing the Occidental common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. The Occidental common stock warrants expire on the one-year anniversary on which no Occidental Preferred remains outstanding . 20 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 17. Fair value measurements (Continued) Our equity index put option derivative contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. We determine the fair value of the equity index put option contract liabilities based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. As described in Note 12, we recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in the second quarter of 2020. These charges reflected our estimates of fair values of the related reporting units for goodwill and of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, and the related measurements are considered level three measurements. In estimating fair values of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we consider the available facts and circumstances concerning the reporting unit and the industries in which it operates. The key assumptions and inputs we generally use in such determinations include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as the selection of a discount rate and other inputs. These inputs also include our qualitative assessment of risks and uncertainties. We utilized discounted cash flow/earnings methods to develop our estimates of the fair values and we also considered other publicly available information. Estimates of the fair value of reporting units can be significantly affected by expectations of the severity, duration or long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict at this time. Consequently, fair value estimates in such instances may be subject to wide variations. We concluded it was appropriate to reflect the increased risks and uncertainties precipitated by the pandemic through a combination of increases in discount rates and reductions to operating and long-term growth assumptions. We also incorporated forecasted operating results that were reduced from what was used in estimating fair value in connection with the 2019 annual impairment test conducted during the fourth quarter. Note 18. Common stock Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the first six months of 2020 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Class A, $ 5 Par Value ( 1,650,000 shares authorized) Class B, $ 0.0033 Par Value ( 3,225,000,000 shares authorized) Issued Treasury Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding Balance December 31, 2019 719,307 ( 17,337 ) 701,970 1,408,183,852 ( 23,702,319 ) 1,384,481,533 Conversions of Class A common stock to Class B common stock ( 27,607 ) — ( 27,607 ) 41,410,500 — 41,410,500 Treasury stock acquired — ( 3,164 ) ( 3,164 ) — ( 31,731,259 ) ( 31,731,259 ) Balance at June 30, 2020 691,700 ( 20,501 ) 671,199 1,449,594,352 ( 55,433,578 ) 1,394,160,774 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,600,640 shares outstanding as of June 30, 2020 and 1,624,958 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $ 20 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. 21 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates for the second quarter and first six months of 2020 were 25.4 % and 15.7 %, respectively, and 20.2 % and 20.9 % in the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, the magnitude of gains or losses included in earnings with respect to our investments in equity securities and of non-deductible expenses, and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. Note 20.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. In July 2020, Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) reached a definitive agreement with Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) to acquire substantially all of Dominion’s natural gas transmission and storage business, which includes more than 7,700 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines, about 900 billion cubic feet of operated natural gas storage capacity and partial ownership of a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility. The acquisition price will be approximately $ 4.0 billion. BHE will also assume approximately $ 5.7 billion of existing asset-related long-term debt. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2020. 22 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 23. Revenues from contracts with customers We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the second quarter and first six months of 2020 and 2019 (in millions). Other revenues included in consolidated revenues were primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. Revenues and earnings before income taxes by segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in millions).

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 24 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Prior to the middle of March, many of our operating businesses were experiencing comparative revenue and earnings increases over 2019. As efforts to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated in the second half of March and continued through the second quarter, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Several of our businesses deemed essential have continued to operate, including our railroad, utilities and energy, insurance and certain of our manufacturing, distribution and service businesses. Revenues and earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter due to closures of facilities where crowds can gather, such as retail stores, restaurants and entertainment venues and closures of certain of our businesses. In response to the effects of the pandemic, we have implemented various business continuity plans to protect our employees and customers. Such plans include a variety of actions, such as temporarily closing certain retail stores, manufacturing facilities and service centers of businesses that were not subject to government mandated closure. Our businesses have implemented practices to protect employees while at work. Such practices have included work-from-home, staggered or reduced work schedules, increased cleaning and sanitation of work spaces, providing employee health screenings, eliminating non-essential travel and face-to-face meetings and providing general health reminders intended to lower the risk of spreading COVID-19. We have also taken actions in response to the economic losses from reductions in consumer demand for products and services we offer and our inability to produce goods and provide services at certain of our businesses. These actions have included employee furloughs, wage and salary reductions, capital spending reductions and other actions intended to help mitigate the economic losses and preserve capital and liquidity. While we believe that certain of these necessary actions are temporary, certain of our businesses are undertaking and will likely continue to undertake restructuring activities that will resize the operations to better fit expected customer demand. We cannot reliably predict when business activities at our numerous and diverse operations will normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $806 million in the second quarter and $1.2 billion in the first six months of 2020, which was largely attributable to unusually high earnings from GEICO due to lower claims frequencies. These results are likely to be temporary, as the full effects of the reductions in premiums from the GEICO Giveback program in underwriting earnings will occur over the remainder of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 when the reduced levels of premiums written under the program are earned and included in our reported revenues. To the extent claims frequencies over this period revert to historical levels, GEICO may incur underwriting losses. Insurance underwriting results in 2020 also included earnings from other primary insurance and losses from reinsurance. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income were relatively unchanged in the second quarter and increased 5.8% in the first six months of 2020 as compared to 2019, reflecting higher dividend income and lower interest income due to significant declines in interest rates and interest earned on our substantial short-term investment balances. 26 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (Continued) After-tax earnings of our railroad business decreased 15.5% in the second quarter and 10.4% in the first six months of 2020 as compared to 2019. Earnings in 2020 reflected the effects on revenues from lower shipping volumes, including the negative effects of COVID-19, partly offset by productivity improvements which lowered operating costs. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 4.3% in the second quarter and decreased 1.5% in the first six months of 2020 compared to 2019. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined 41.7% in the second quarter and 25.6% in the first six months of 2020 versus 2019. Earnings of these businesses were generally lower in 2020 attributable to the effects of COVID-19, although such effects varied among our businesses. Investment and derivative gains/losses in 2020 and 2019 included significant gains and losses, including significant unrealized gains and losses from market price changes on our holdings of equity securities. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Other earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $10.9 billion, including our equity method share of impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as a component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held strategy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance operations. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider pre-tax catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million from a current year event as significant. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $118 billion as of June 30, 2020. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, underwriting results in 2020 of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses were negatively affected by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including estimated provisions for claims and uncollectible premiums and incremental operating costs to maintain customer service levels at certain underwriting units. The potential effects of the pandemic may be further affected by future judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims that we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. We also anticipate our underwriting results for the remainder of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 will be adversely affected from lower premiums for certain business attributable to premium credits granted to policyholders and when premiums are a function of the insured’s payroll. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss): GEICO $ 2,060 $ 393 $ 3,044 $ 1,163 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 96 167 63 137 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (1,103 ) (104 ) (1,592 ) (357 ) Pre-tax underwriting earnings 1,053 456 1,515 943 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 247 103 346 201 Net underwriting earnings $ 806 $ 353 $ 1,169 $ 742 Effective income tax rate 23.4 % 22.1 % 22.8 % 22.3 % 27 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 8,090 $ 8,703 $ 17,771 $ 17,966 Premiums earned $ 9,040 100.0 $ 8,869 100.0 $ 18,149 100.0 $ 17,491 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 5,614 62.1 7,276 82.0 12,380 68.2 13,832 79.1 Underwriting expenses 1,366 15.1 1,200 13.6 2,725 15.0 2,496 14.3 Total losses and expenses 6,980 77.2 8,476 95.6 15,105 83.2 16,328 93.4 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 2,060 $ 393 $ 3,044 $ 1,163 GEICO generated pre-tax underwriting earnings of $2.1 billion in the second quarter and $3.0 billion in the first six months, reflecting significant declines in losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to lower claims frequencies from the effects of less driving by policyholders in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. As policyholder driving increases, claims frequencies are expected to increase and as the effects of the GEICO Giveback program (see following paragraph) on earned premiums increase, GEICO could experience pre-tax underwriting losses over the second half of 2020, which would offset a portion of the pre-tax underwriting earnings generated in the first half. Premiums written decreased 7.0% in the second quarter and 1.1% in the first six months of 2020 compared to 2019. The GEICO Giveback program was implemented on April 8, 2020, providing a 15% premium credit to all voluntary auto and motorcycle policies renewing between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020, as well as to any new policies purchased during the same period. The GEICO Giveback program reduced premiums written in the second quarter of 2020 by approximately $1.3 billion. Because premiums are earned over the policy terms, the effect of the GEICO Giveback program on underwriting results is delayed. Premiums earned increased 1.9% in the second quarter and 3.8% in the first six months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019, which included a reduction of $293 million attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. It is estimated that during the period between April 8, 2020 and April 7, 2021, earned premiums will be reduced by approximately $2.5 billion as a result of the GEICO Giveback program. Premiums earned will very likely decline in the third and fourth quarters even if policies-in-force and exposures increase. Over the past twelve months, voluntary auto policies-in -force grew 8.3% and premiums per auto policy decreased approximately 2.3%. The increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force resulted from a 24.2% decrease in lost policies partially offset by a 1.7% decrease in new business sales. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 930,000 during the first six months of 2020. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, GEICO paused cancellations of insurance policies for non-payment, which contributed to the increase in policies-in-force in the first half of 2020. Consequently, as policy cancellations for non-payment resume, policies-in-force growth is expected to slow considerably over the second half of 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the second quarter of 2020 were approximately $5.6 billion, a decrease of $1.7 billion (22.8%) and in the first six months of 2020 were approximately $12.4 billion, a decrease of $1.5 billion (10.5%) compared to 2019. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 was 62.1% and 68.2%, respectively, decreases of 19.9 and 10.9 percentage points compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively. The decreases in the loss ratio reflect significant declines in claims frequencies and increases in claims severities. Claims frequencies in the first six months of 2020 were lower for property damage, bodily injury and personal injury protection coverages (twenty-seven to thirty percent range) and collision coverage (twenty-four to twenty-six percent range) compared to 2019. Average claims severities in the first six months of 2020 were higher for property damage coverage (nine to eleven percent range), collision coverage (seven to nine percent range) and bodily injury coverage (ten to twelve percent range). The low point in claims frequencies was reached in April. Frequencies in May and June increased significantly from April, although they were well below historical levels. GEICO’s loss and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months of 2020 also included reductions in the ultimate claims loss estimates for prior years’ loss events of $166 million in 2020 and $54 million in 2019. 28 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Underwriting expenses in the first six months of 2020 were approximately $2.7 billion, an increase of $229 million (9.2%) over 2019. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in the first six months of 2020 was 15.0%, an increase of 0.7 percentage points compared to 2019. The underwriting expense increase was primarily attributable to higher employee-related costs, technology costs and increased allowances for uncollectible premiums, partially offset by lower premium and state taxes. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), and National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 2,149 $ 2,370 $ 4,604 $ 4,711 Premiums earned $ 2,244 100.0 $ 2,287 100.0 $ 4,613 100.0 $ 4,438 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 1,582 70.5 1,568 68.6 3,393 73.6 3,138 70.7 Underwriting expenses 566 25.2 552 24.1 1,157 25.0 1,163 26.2 Total losses and expenses 2,148 95.7 2,120 92.7 4,550 98.6 4,301 96.9 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 96 $ 167 $ 63 $ 137 Premiums written in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 decreased $221 million (9.3%) and $107 million (2.3%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The decreases were primarily attributable to lower workers’ compensation and commercial auto business, partly offset by increases from BH Specialty in property and casualty business. The declines in workers’ compensation and commercial auto premiums written reflected the effects of reduced exposures and premium refunds related to COVID-19, increased price competition in the market and the effect of the Applied Underwriters divestiture in 2019. Premiums earned in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 decreased $43 million (1.9%) and increased $175 million (3.9%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. BH Primary insurers generated pre-tax underwriting earnings of $96 million in the second quarter and $63 million in the first six months of 2020 compared to $167 million in the second quarter and $137 million in the first six months of 2019. Underwriting results in the first six months of 2020 included estimated claim losses and allowances for credit losses attributable to the pandemic, partly offset by lower other underwriting expenses. Loss ratios for the first six months were 73.6% in 2020 and 70.7% in 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred included reductions for prior years’ loss events of $84 million in the first six months of 2020 and $144 million in 2019. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of liability insurance and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs are generally subject to longer claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher than expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings, regulatory actions and other factors not currently anticipated. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and General Re Life Corporation (“General Re”). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN. 29 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (in millions).

The increases in premiums written were primarily attributable to new property contracts, partially offset by the unfavorable foreign currency effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 increased $1.1 billion (77.1%) and $1.5 billion (45.5%) over the same periods in 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected estimated COVID-19 related claims of approximately $350 million in the second quarter and $575 million in the first six months of 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months included a net increase in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $439 million in 2020 and $269 million in 2019. The increase in 2020 is primarily attributable to legacy environmental, asbestos and other latent injury claims. We incurred no significant losses from property catastrophe events in the first six months of 2020 and 2019. Underwriting results in the first six months included approximately $39 million related to allowances for credit losses attributable to the pandemic in 2020. 30 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

The increases included $198 million in the second quarter and $366 million in the first six months from a single reinsurance contract that incepted in the fourth quarter of 2019 covering health insurance risks. The increases in premiums written also reflected volume growth in Asia and Europe, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar. The life/health business produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $41 million in the second quarter and $46 million in the first six months of 2020 compared to pre-tax losses of $1 million in the second quarter and pre-tax earnings of $190 million in the first six months of 2019. Life/health underwriting results in the first quarter of 2019 included a one-time pre-tax gain of $163 million attributable to a yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract amendment, which effectively eliminated our future exposures under the contract. In the second quarter of 2019, underwriting results also reflected an increase in disability benefit liabilities in Australia, attributable to higher claims experience and changes to various underlying assumptions. Retroactive reinsurance There were no significant retroactive reinsurance contracts written in the first six months of 2020 and 2019. Pre-tax underwriting losses in 2020 and 2019 derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amount of future claim payments, as well as from foreign currency gains/losses arising from the periodic remeasurement of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities related to contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency remeasurement losses of $115 million in the second quarter and gains of $90 million in the first six months of 2020 compared to gains of $41 million in the second quarter and losses of $11 million in the first six months of 2019. Retroactive reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses of $345 million in the second quarter and $592 million in the first six months of 2020 compared to $279 million in the second quarter and $550 million in the first six months of 2019. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were $41.8 billion and $42.4 billion, respectively. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were $13.2 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively. Deferred charge assets will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 were $182 million and $341 million, respectively, compared to $229 million and $423 million, respectively, in 2019. The periodic payment annuity market is price sensitive. The volumes written can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments and the level of competition. 31 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Periodic payment annuity (Continued) Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include the effects of mortality and interest rate changes and remeasurement gains and losses related to foreign currency denominated liabilities of certain contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries. During the second quarter and first six months of 2020, pre-tax underwriting results included remeasurement gains of $6 million and $111 million, respectively. Remeasurement gains were $37 million in the second quarter and $9 million in the first six months of 2019. Excluding foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses were $152 million in the second quarter and $313 million in the first six months of 2020 compared to $112 million in the second quarter and $254 million in the first six months of 2019. Discounted periodic payment annuity liabilities as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were $13.9 billion and $13.5 billion, respectively. The weighted average discount rate of these liabilities was 4.0% as of June 30, 2020. Variable annuity Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $105 million in the second quarter and pre-tax losses of $129 million in the first six months of 2020 compared to pre-tax earnings of $12 million in the second quarter and $101 million in the first six months of 2019. Periodic underwriting results from this business reflect changes in remaining liabilities for underlying guaranteed benefits reinsured, which are affected by changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting results from these contracts can be volatile, reflecting the volatility of securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Interest and other investment income $ 270 $ 577 $ 674 $ 1,090 Dividend income 1,343 1,072 2,586 2,044 Investment income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,613 1,649 3,260 3,134 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 245 283 506 531 Net investment income $ 1,368 $ 1,366 $ 2,754 $ 2,603 Effective income tax rate 15.1 % 17.0 % 15.5 % 16.8 % Interest and other investment income declined $307 million (53.2%) in the second quarter and $416 million (38.2%) in the first six months of 2020 compared to 2019. The declines were primarily due to lower income from short-term investments. Dividend income increased $271 million (25.3%) in the second quarter and $542 million (26.5%) in the first six months of 2020 compared to 2019. The increases were primarily attributable to the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% cumulative preferred stock of Occidental on August 8, 2019 and higher dividend rates on certain common stock investments. We reduced our overall investments in equity securities in the second quarter of 2020, and dividend income over the second half of 2020 may decline from the first half. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. Short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and continued to decline through the first half of 2020. We expect such rates, which are historically low, to remain low and that our earnings from such investments over the remainder of 2020 will be substantially lower than in 2019. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, less insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float was approximately $131 billion on June 30, 2020 and $129 billion on December 31, 2019. Our average cost of float was negative for the first six months of 2020 as our underwriting operations generated pre-tax earnings of $1.5 billion. 32 Item 2.

Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped which includes consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Revenues $ 4,602 $ 5,893 $ 10,019 $ 11,655 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 993 1,334 2,237 2,734 Fuel 327 775 941 1,486 Purchased services 560 687 1,226 1,400 Depreciation and amortization 612 595 1,227 1,186 Equipment rents, materials and other 356 462 788 876 Total operating expenses 2,848 3,853 6,419 7,682 Interest expense 260 267 522 535 3,108 4,120 6,941 8,217 Pre-tax earnings 1,494 1,773 3,078 3,438 Income taxes 363 435 757 847 Net earnings $ 1,131 $ 1,338 $ 2,321 $ 2,591 Effective income tax rate 24.3 % 24.5 % 24.6 % 24.6 % 33 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) BNSF’s revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 were $4.6 billion and $10.0 billion, respectively, representing decreases of approximately $1.3 billion (21.9%) and $1.6 billion (14.0%) versus the corresponding periods in 2019. BNSF’s revenues in 2020 reflected lower volumes of 17.9% in the second quarter and 11.7% in the first six months, as well as a 2.7% year-to-date decrease in average revenue per car/unit. Volume in the first six months of 2020 was 4.44 million cars/units compared to 5.03 million cars/units in 2019. Pre-tax earnings were $1.5 billion and $3.1 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2020, respectively, decreases of 15.7% and 10.5%, respectively, compared to 2019. The decreases principally resulted from the negative impacts on volumes of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effects on earnings in 2019 of a revenue increase related to the favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing and a reduction to expense from a retirement plan curtailment gain arising from a plan amendment. These effects were partially offset by significant improvements in 2020 in service, velocity and cost performance compared to the first six months of 2019 when severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network negatively affected expenses and service levels. Revenues from consumer products were $1.6 billion in the second quarter and $3.3 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 17.4% and 14.6%, respectively, from 2019. The decreases reflected lower average revenue per car/unit for both periods and volume decreases of 12.1% in the second quarter and 9.7% in the first six months of 2020. The volume decreases were due to lower intermodal and automotive shipments attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenues from industrial products were $1.2 billion in the second quarter and $2.6 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 26.4% and 13.9%, respectively, from 2019. The decreases were attributable to lower volumes of 25.9% in the second quarter and 14.4% in the first six months of 2020. Average revenue per car/unit was lower in the second quarter and higher in the first six months. The volume decreases were primarily driven by a decline in U.S. industrial production due to the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced demand in the energy sector, which drove lower sand and petroleum products volume. Revenues from agricultural products were $1.1 billion in the second quarter and $2.2 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 12.2% and 5.1%, respectively, from 2019. The decreases reflected lower revenue per car/unit for both periods and volume decreases of 7.0% in the second quarter and 2.1% in the first six months of 2020 as compared to 2019. The volume decreases were due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily impacting ethanol and related commodities, as well as lower net exports. Revenues from coal were $541 million in the second quarter and $1.3 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 38.7% and 25.4%, respectively, compared to 2019. The decreases reflected lower average revenue per car/unit and lower volume of 33.6% in the second quarter and 21.0% in the first six months. Volumes were primarily impacted by lower electricity demand driven by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and mild winter weather, low natural gas prices and plant retirements. Operating expenses in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 were $2.8 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, decreases of $1.0 billion (26.1%) and $1.3 billion (16.4%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The ratio of operating expenses to revenues decreased 3.5 percentage points to 61.9% in the second quarter and 1.8 percentage points to 64.1% in the first six months of 2020 versus the 2019 periods. BNSF's expenses in 2020 reflected lower volume-related costs, productivity improvements, the effects of cost control initiatives and improved weather conditions compared to the first six months of 2019. Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $341 million (25.6%) in the second quarter and $497 million (18.2%) in the first six months of 2020 compared to 2019. The decreases were primarily due to lower employee counts associated with lower volume and due to improved productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $448 million (57.8%) in the second quarter and $545 million (36.7%) in the first six months of 2020 compared to 2019. The decreases were primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved efficiency. Purchased service expenses decreased $127 million (18.5%) in the second quarter and $174 million (12.4%) in the first six months of 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower volume, improved productivity and insurance recoveries in 2020 related to flooding in 2019. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses decreased $106 million (22.9%) in the second quarter and $88 million (10.0%) in the first six months of 2020 compared to 2019, as a result of lower volume-related costs, the effects of cost controls and lower personal injury expense in 2020, partially offset by a pension plan curtailment gain in the first quarter of 2019. BNSF is an important part of the national and global supply chain and, as an essential business, has continued to operate throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant economic slowdown that has adversely affected the demand for transportation services. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and the full extent to which it may impact BNSF’s business, operating results, financial condition, or liquidity will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. We believe BNSF’s fundamental business remains strong and it has ample liquidity to continue business operations during this volatile period. 34 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We currently own 91.1% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are largely based on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 3,419 $ 3,567 $ 7,053 $ 7,392 Real estate operating revenue 1,193 1,327 2,086 2,112 Other income (loss) 47 76 27 138 Total revenue 4,659 4,970 9,166 9,642 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 888 1,027 1,926 2,241 Energy operating expense 1,638 1,681 3,349 3,332 Real estate operating costs and expense 1,116 1,210 1,989 2,016 Interest expense 484 459 950 920 Total costs and expense 4,126 4,377 8,214 8,509 Pre-tax earnings 533 593 952 1,133 Income tax expense (benefit)* (165 ) (80 ) (366 ) (210 ) Net earnings after income taxes 698 673 1,318 1,343 Noncontrolling interests 4 4 7 7 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway Energy 694 669 1,311 1,336 Noncontrolling interests 61 62 117 124 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 633 $ 607 $ 1,194 $ 1,212 Effective income tax rate (31.0 )% (13.5 )% (38.4 )% (18.5 )% * Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) PacifiCorp PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. After-tax earnings were $167 million and $343 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2020, respectively, decreases of $1 million (0.6%) and $5 million (1.4%), respectively, compared to 2019. The declines reflected lower utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower operating expenses, increased allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction and increased income tax benefits from production tax credits from repowering certain wind-powered generating facilities. Utility margin was $761 million in the second quarter and $1.6 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of $22 million and $27 million, respectively, compared to 2019, primarily attributable to lower operating revenue from a 2.9% year-to-date decline in retail customer volumes, partially offset by price impacts from changes in sales mix. The decrease in retail customer volumes was primarily due to impacts of COVID-19, partly offset by the favorable impacts of weather and an increase in the average number of customers. MidAmerican Energy Company MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings were $208 million in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of $55 million (35.9%) as compared to 2019. After-tax earnings were $358 million in the first six months of 2020, an increase of $15 million (4.4%) compared to 2019. The increases were primarily due to increased income tax benefits from production tax credits driven by repowering existing facilities and new wind projects placed in-service and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction and higher interest expense. Electric utility margin, excluding energy efficiency program revenue, in the second quarter of 2020 was $439 million, an increase of $14 million compared to 2019. The increase reflected a 1.8% net increase in electric retail customer volumes due largely to weather and increased usage from certain industrial customers, partially offset by impacts of COVID-19 on retail volumes and lower generation and purchased power costs. The electric utility margin increase was partially offset by the effects of lower wholesale revenue. Electric utility margin was $838 million in the first six months of 2020, a decrease of $37 million compared to 2019. The decline was primarily due to lower wholesale revenue and retail price impacts from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower generation and purchased power costs and a 0.5% increase in retail customer volumes. Natural gas utility margin decreased 15% year-to-date, reflecting a 12.9% reduction in retail customer volumes, primarily due to weather. NV Energy NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings were $98 million in the second quarter and $118 million in the first six months of 2020, increases of $17 million (21.0%) and $8 million (7.3%), respectively, compared to 2019, primarily due to higher electric utility margin, higher other income (second quarter only) and lower income tax expense from the favorable impacts of ratemaking. The year-to-date increase was partially offset by higher depreciation expense. Electric utility margin was $406 million in the second quarter and $728 million in the first six months of 2020, increases of $11 million and $12 million, respectively, compared to 2019, primarily due to price impacts from changes in sales mix, partially offset by a 0.9% year-to-date decrease in retail customer volumes, including distribution-only service customers, primarily due to impacts of COVID-19. Northern Powergrid After-tax earnings in the second quarter of 2020 decreased $5 million (7.8%) compared to 2019. The decrease reflected lower distribution revenues of $11 million as a result of 12.8% lower units distributed, largely due to impacts of COVID-19, partly offset by higher tariff rates. After-tax earnings increased 1.4% in the first six months of 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower interest expense, partially offset by lower distribution revenues of $3 million as a result of 7.0% lower units distributed, largely due to impacts of COVID-19, offset by increased tariff rates. Natural gas pipelines After-tax earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 increased $16 million (33.3%) and $14 million (6.1%), respectively, compared to 2019, primarily due to higher transportation revenue and the favorable impact of a rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas. The year-to-date increase was partially offset by increased depreciation, higher interest expense and lower storage revenue. Other energy businesses After-tax earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 were $184 million and $320 million, respectively, increases of $26 million (16.5%) and $71 million (28.5%), respectively, compared to 2019. The increases were primarily due to income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation. 36 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) Real estate brokerage After-tax earnings in the second quarter of 2020 decreased $31 million compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to an unfavorable contingent earn-out remeasurement and lower after-tax earnings from brokerage services due to a 21% decrease in closed units, in large part from impacts of COVID-19, partially offset by higher earnings from mortgage services, primarily due to higher refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment. After-tax earnings increased 1.5% in the first six months of 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher after-tax earnings from mortgage services, primarily due to higher refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment and partially offset by an unfavorable contingent earn-out remeasurement and lower after-tax earnings from brokerage services due to an 11% decrease in closed units, offset by lower operating expenses. Corporate interest and other After-tax earnings decreased $52 million and $131 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2020, respectively, compared to 2019, primarily due to lower federal income tax credits recognized, state income tax benefits recognized in 2019 and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher after-tax earnings from non-regulated energy services. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months Revenues Earnings * Revenues Earnings * 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Manufacturing $ 13,033 $ 16,206 $ 1,399 $ 2,527 $ 28,068 $ 31,276 $ 3,510 $ 4,721 Service and retailing 17,255 19,873 452 804 36,032 39,097 1,075 1,536 $ 30,288 $ 36,079 $ 64,100 $ 70,373 Pre-tax earnings 1,851 3,331 4,585 6,257 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 402 844 1,098 1,570 $ 1,449 $ 2,487 $ 3,487 $ 4,687 Effective income tax rate 21.5 % 24.7 % 23.6 % 24.6 % * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which were primarily from the amortization of identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings in the preceding table were $196 million in the second quarter and $398 million in the first six months of 2020, compared to $188 million in the second quarter and $380 million in the first six months of 2019. In the second quarter and first six months of 2020, such expenses also exclude goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset after-tax impairment charges of $10.35 billion. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page 26 and in the “Other” earnings section on page 43. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. The industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (“CTB”)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (“LSPI”)). Marmon includes UTLX Company (“UTLX”), which provides various products and services (including equipment leasing) for the rail and mobile crane industries. 37 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Manufacturing (Continued) The building products group includes homebuilding and manufactured housing finance (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months Revenues Pre-tax earnings Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Industrial products $ 5,789 $ 7,887 $ 535 $ 1,552 $ 13,147 $ 15,564 $ 1,841 $ 2,983 Building products 4,968 5,369 696 726 9,825 9,931 1,263 1,208 Consumer products 2,276 2,950 168 249 5,096 5,781 406 530 $ 13,033 $ 16,206 $ 1,399 $ 2,527 $ 28,068 $ 31,276 $ 3,510 $ 4,721 Industrial products Revenues of the industrial products group were $5.8 billion in the second quarter and $13.1 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 26.6% and 15.5%, respectively, from comparable 2019 periods. Pre-tax earnings of the group were $535 million in the second quarter and $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2020, declines of 65.5% and 38.3% compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 14.0% in the first six months of 2020 compared to 19.2% in 2019. PCC’s revenues were $1.8 billion in the second quarter and $4.2 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 32.5% from the second quarter and 19.5% from the first six months of 2019. In the second quarter and first six months of 2020, PCC experienced significant declines in aerospace markets. The COVID-19 pandemic produced material declines in commercial air travel during the second quarter. Airlines responded by reducing and/or cancelling aircraft orders, which is resulting in significant reductions in build rates by aircraft manufacturers and significant inventory reduction initiatives being implemented by PCC’s customers. Further, Boeing’s ongoing 737 MAX aircraft production issues have contributed to the declines in aerospace product sales in the second quarter and first six months of 2020. PCC incurred a pre-tax loss of $78 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to pre-tax earnings of $481 million in the second quarter of 2019. The earnings decrease reflected the decline in aerospace products sales, which contributed to reduced manufacturing efficiencies and lower gross sales margin rates. In addition, PCC management is undertaking aggressive restructuring actions to resize operations in response to reduced expected volumes in aerospace markets. During the first six months of 2020, PCC reduced its workforce by approximately 10,000 employees representing about 30% of its total workforce at year end 2019. Restructuring costs and inventory and fixed asset write-downs in the second quarter of 2020 were approximately $250 million. Earnings as a percentage of revenues are expected to continue to be negatively impacted through 2020 due to inefficiencies associated with aligning operations to reduced aircraft build rates. We believe the duration and severity of the pandemic and the long-term effects on commercial air travel and aerospace industries remains unclear. Lubrizol’s revenues were $1.3 billion in the second quarter and $2.9 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 24.1% from the second quarter and 14.3% from the first six months of 2019. The declines reflected lower volumes, attributable to the worldwide economic impacts of COVID-19 and the impact of a fire at an additives manufacturing, blending and storage facility in Rouen, France at the end of the third quarter of 2019. While the Rouen operations were partially restarted in December 2019, volumes at the facility continued to be below historical levels through the first half of 2020. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume declined 26% in the second quarter and 15% in the first six months of 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting declines in the Additives and Engineered Materials product lines, partly offset by higher volumes in Life Science products. 38 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings decreased 41.3% in the second quarter and 25.6% in the first six months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily attributable to lower sales volumes, the impact of the Rouen fire, lower average selling prices and unfavorable effects from foreign currency translation. These negative impacts were partially offset by lower average raw material costs and lower operating expenses. Marmon’s revenues were $1.7 billion in the second quarter and $3.7 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 21.1% from the second quarter and 11.0% from the first six months of 2019. In the second quarter of 2020, excluding acquisitions, revenues decreased in almost all of Marmon’s sectors due to lower volumes, primarily attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the largest effects experienced in the Transportation Products, Retail Solutions, Food Service Technologies and Metal Services sectors. Additionally, revenues in 2020 decreased due to lower metal prices in the Electrical, Plumbing & Refrigeration and Metal Services sectors, the effect of 2019 divestitures and unfavorable foreign currency translation. The drastic declines in oil prices in 2020 also adversely affected volumes and revenues in the Crane, Electrical, Water, Industrial and Rail & Leasing sectors. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings decreased 33.4% in the second quarter and 17.4% in the first six months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The decreases reflected the declines in revenues, increased restructuring charges and lower interest income. We expect additional restructuring initiatives will take place over the remainder of 2020 in response to the reduced product demand, particularly in the sectors most affected by the pandemic. IMC’s revenues were $637 million in the second quarter and $1.5 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 26.5% from the second quarter and 15.6% from the first six months of 2019. The revenue declines were attributable to the negative effects of COVID-19 and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by the effects of business acquisitions over the past year. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 53.4% in the second quarter and 37.4% in the first six months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019, as a result of the sales declines and changes in sales mix. Building products Revenues of the building products group were $5.0 billion in the second quarter and $9.8 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of $401 million (7.5%) and $106 million (1.1%), respectively, compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2019. Pre-tax earnings of the group were $696 million in the second quarter and $1.3 billion in the first six months of 2020, a decrease of 4.1% from the second quarter and an increase of 4.6% from the first six months of 2019. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 12.9% and 12.2% in the first six months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Clayton Homes’ revenues were $2.0 billion in the second quarter and $3.8 billion in the first six months of 2020, increases of 8.2% and 10.5% over the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively. The comparative increases were primarily due to increases in home sales of 6.7% in the second quarter and 10.5% in the first six months, reflecting a net increase in units sold and changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 22% in the first six months of 2020, while manufactured home unit sales were relatively unchanged. Interest income from lending activities in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 increased 5.8% and 6.1%, respectively, as compared to 2019. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were $16.0 billion as of June 30, 2020 compared to $15.9 billion as of December 31, 2019. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $319 million in the second quarter and $520 million in the first six months of 2020, increases of 13.2% and 4.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The earnings increases reflected higher earnings from home building activities and increased interest income, net of interest expense, partly offset by increased provisions for credit losses. The increases in credit loss provisions were driven by expected losses attributable to the impact on the economy and unemployment rates resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were $2.9 billion in the second quarter and $6.0 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 16.0% and 7.2%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. The decreases were primarily attributable to lower volumes associated with the pandemic, partly offset by increased paint and coatings volumes from a new agreement with Ace Hardware Stores. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were $377 million in the second quarter and $743 million in the first six months of 2020, a decrease of 15.4% from the second quarter and an increase of 4.5% from the first six months of 2019. Earnings in the second quarter of 2020 reflected the reductions in sales volumes, partially offset by the effects of lower average material costs and expense containment efforts. Results for the first six months of 2020 also benefitted from lower facilities closure costs and higher sales volumes in the first quarter. 39 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Consumer products Consumer products revenues were $2.3 billion in the second quarter and $5.1 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 22.8% and 11.8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. Apparel and footwear sales declined 28.9% in the second quarter of 2020, reflecting lower sales volumes from the effects of COVID-19 related retail store closures and reduced or cancelled orders, partly offset by an increase at Brooks Sports. The increase at Brooks Sports was partly attributable to the effect of a significant reduction in sales in the second quarter of 2019 caused by product shipping delays at a new distribution facility. In the second quarter of 2020, Forest River sales declined 26.1%, attributable to lower volumes, while Duracell revenues increased 16.4%. Consumer products pre-tax earnings were $168 million in the second quarter and $406 million in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 32.5% and 23.4%, respectively, compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the first six months were 8.0% in 2020 and 9.2% in 2019. The decreases in pre-tax earnings reflected comparative declines in earnings from apparel and footwear of 76.8% in the second quarter and 48.7% in the first six months of 2020, which included various incremental costs and charges related to COVID-19. In addition, pre-tax earnings of Forest River declined 37.8% in the second quarter and 27.1% in the first six months of 2020 as compared to 2019. The sales and earnings declines in the second quarter at these businesses lessened significantly in the month of June, as the local economies reopened from the shutdowns. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months Revenues Pre-tax earnings Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Service $ 2,667 $ 3,436 $ 260 $ 502 $ 6,025 $ 6,854 $ 685 $ 974 Retailing 3,370 4,026 148 243 6,968 7,633 281 392 McLane Company 11,218 12,411 44 59 23,039 24,610 109 170 $ 17,255 $ 19,873 $ 452 $ 804 $ 36,032 $ 39,097 $ 1,075 $ 1,536 Service Our service business group offers fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI), franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen) and offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG) and until the time of their sale on March 16, 2020, the publishing of newspapers. Service group revenues were $2.7 billion in the second quarter and $6.0 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 22.4% and 12.1%, respectively, compared to 2019. The comparative revenue declines included declines of 31.2% in the second quarter and 16.1% for the first six months from NetJets and FlightSafety, which were primarily attributable to lower demand for aviation services as a consequence of the pandemic. In addition, the declines reflected year-to-date revenue declines of 3.0% at TTI and 24.3% at CORT, as well as the effects of the disposition of the newspaper operations. Pre-tax earnings of the service group were $260 million in the second quarter and $685 million in the first six months of 2020, decreases of $242 million (48.2%) and $289 million (29.7%), respectively, compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 11.4% in the first six months of 2020 compared to 14.2% in 2019. The comparative earnings declines were primarily attributable to lower earnings from FlightSafety, NetJets and TTI, and to a lesser extent, XTRA and CORT. TTI’s earnings decline reflected lower gross margin rates. The declines at NetJets and FlightSafety were due to lower demand for services and increased asset impairment and restructuring charges. 40 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”), which consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Other retailing businesses include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. Other retailing businesses also include three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories. Retailing group revenues were $3.4 billion in the second quarter and $7.0 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 16.3% and 8.7%, respectively, compared to 2019. BHA’s revenues, which represented about 2/3 of our combined retailing revenues in 2020, decreased 11.1% in the second quarter and 6.2% in the first six months compared to the same periods in 2019. BHA’s comparative revenue decreases reflected decreases in new and pre-owned vehicle sales of 11% in the second quarter and 6% in the first six months and lower vehicle service and repair revenues in the second quarter, which were attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Home furnishings group revenues, which represented about 20% of the aggregate retailing group revenues for the first six months of 2020, decreased 24.7% in the second quarter and 12.1% in the first six months of 2020 as compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings of the retail group were $148 million in the second quarter and $281 million in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 39.1% and 28.3%, respectively, from 2019. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 35.6% in the second quarter and 19.9% in the first six months of 2020, primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses and lower floorplan interest expense. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined $129 million in the second quarter and $148 million in the first six months as compared to 2019. The spread of COVID-19 throughout the U.S. resulted in the temporary closures or restricted operations at our retail store operations during 2020 and significantly lower sales. Sales volumes increased and operating results improved over the latter part of the second quarter as these operations were slowly reopened. Also, we incurred additional charges in the second quarter attributable to asset impairment charges and credit losses. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised about 2/3 of McLane’s consolidated sales in the first six months of 2020 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues were $11.2 billion in the second quarter and $23.0 billion in the first six months of 2020, decreases of 9.6% and 6.4%, respectively, compared to 2019. Revenues in the second quarter of 2020 decreased 9.4% in the grocery business (5.8% year-to date) and 11.6% in the foodservice business (8.9% year-to-date) as compared to 2019. The declines were attributable to COVID-19 related restaurant closures (particularly for casual dining restaurant customers) and lower sales in certain product categories within the grocery business. Pre-tax earnings decreased $15 million (25.4%) in the second quarter and $61 million (35.9%) in the first six months of 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease in the first six months of 2020 included charges of $23 million for credit losses and inventory losses in the foodservice operations and the impact of lower sales. McLane continues to operate in an intensely competitive business environment, which is negatively affecting its current operating results. 41 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains/losses follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Investment gains (losses) $ 39,289 $ 9,835 $ (29,593 ) $ 29,387 Derivative gains (losses) 796 213 (597 ) 983 Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 40,085 10,048 (30,190 ) 30,370 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 8,440 2,114 (6,218 ) 6,330 Net gains (losses) $ 31,645 $ 7,934 $ (23,972 ) $ 24,040 Effective income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 20.7 % 20.8 % Investment gains/losses As a result of a change to GAAP effective in 2018, we are required to include the unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities in our reported earnings. While this accounting standard does not change the effect on our consolidated shareholders’ equity or total comprehensive income, it has significantly increased the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains/losses in 2020 included net unrealized gains of $39.4 billion in the second quarter and net unrealized losses of $18.4 billion in the first six months and in 2019 included net unrealized gains of $9.8 billion in the second quarter and $29.2 billion in the first six months attributable to equity securities we still held at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Investment losses on equity securities sold in the first six months of 2020 were $11.2 billion, which included losses of $10.7 billion from market value changes in the first quarter on securities that were sold in the second quarter. Taxable investment losses on equity securities sold, which is the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $4.5 billion in the second quarter and $3.3 billion in the first six months of 2020. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold were $0.8 billion in the second quarter and $1.4 billion in the first six months of 2019. Investment gains/losses from periodic changes in securities prices will continue to cause significant volatility in our consolidated earnings. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe that the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. Substantially all remaining contracts will expire by February 2023. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant due to the volatility of market prices in the underlying equity markets. As of June 30, 2020, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was approximately $1.2 billion and our recorded liability at fair value was $1.6 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. Equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax gains of $796 million in the second quarter and pre-tax losses of $597 million in the first six months of 2020, primarily due to changes in equity index values. Equity index put option contracts generated pre-tax gains of $213 million in the second quarter and $983 million in the first six months of 2019. 42 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2020 2019 2020 2019 Equity method earnings (loss) $ (154 ) $ 131 $ 102 $ 297 Acquisition accounting expenses (196 ) (188 ) (398 ) (380 ) Goodwill and intangible asset impairments (10,350 ) — (10,350 ) — Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (76 ) (72 ) (172 ) (146 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes (92 ) (87 ) 83 47 Income tax expense adjustment — — — (377 ) Other, principally corporate investment income 131 204 331 418 Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ (10,737 ) $ (12 ) $ (10,404 ) $ (141 ) After-tax equity method earnings (loss) includes Berkshire’s share of earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. Our Kraft Heinz investment produced after-tax losses of $297 million for the second quarter and $198 million for the first six months of 2020 and included $513 million in the second quarter and $552 million in the first six months associated with goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. As discussed in Note 5 to the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, financial results of Kraft Heinz for the first and second quarters of 2019 were not made available to us until the third quarter of 2019. Accordingly, our consolidated statements of earnings for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 do not include our share of Kraft Heinz’s earnings for those periods. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible asset impairments include $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. See Critical Accounting Policies on page 45 for additional details. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and BHFC. As of June 30, 2020, outstanding borrowings included senior notes of €6.85 billion par, ¥625.5 billion par and £1.75 billion par. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce non-cash unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The income tax expense adjustment in the first six months of 2019 relates to investments that we made between 2015 and 2018 in certain tax equity investment funds, which aggregated approximately $340 million. In December 2018 and during the first quarter of 2019, we learned of allegations by federal authorities of fraudulent income conduct by the sponsor of these funds and in January 2020, the principals involved in creating the investment funds plead guilty to criminal charges related to the sale of the investments. In the first quarter of 2019, we concluded it was more likely than not that the income tax benefits that we recognized prior to 2019 were not valid. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at June 30, 2020 was $393.5 billion, a decrease of $31.3 billion since December 31, 2019. Net loss attributable to Berkshire shareholders in the first six months of 2020 was approximately $23.5 billion. Earnings in 2020 included after-tax losses on our investments of approximately $23.5 billion, which were primarily due to declines in the market prices of our investments in equity securities since December 31, 2019. Our results in 2020 also included after-tax goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $10.9 billion. Our operating business groups are preparing for reduced cash flows from reduced revenues and economic activity as a result of COVID-19. We are taking measures to reduce costs as appropriate through the measures previously described in this Report. We currently believe our liquidity and capital strength, which is extremely strong, to be more than adequate. 43 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition (Continued) At June 30, 2020, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $142.8 billion, which included $120.8 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $226.7 billion. During the second quarter we received approximately $12.8 billion from the sales of equity securities, net of the costs of equity securities purchased. The proceeds from these activities have been primarily reinvested in U.S. Treasury Bills. Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at June 30, 2020 was $21.7 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion since December 31, 2019. In March 2020, Berkshire repaid maturing senior notes of €1.0 billion and issued €1.0 billion of 0.0% senior notes due in 2025. In April 2020, Berkshire issued ¥195.5 billion of senior notes (approximately $1.8 billion), which has a weighted average interest rate of 1.07% and maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2060. In the first quarter of 2021, senior notes of $1.6 billion will mature. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $16.5 billion at June 30, 2020, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $11.0 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our UTLX railcar leasing business. In January 2020, BHFC repaid $350 million of maturing senior notes and in March 2020, issued $500 million of 1.85% senior notes due in 2030. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. Over the next twelve months, approximately $1.3 billion of BHFC senior notes will mature. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of these two operations in the first six months of 2020 were $4.5 billion and we currently forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $5.7 billion over the remainder of 2020. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.3 billion as of June 30, 2020, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2019. In April 2020, BNSF issued $575 million of 3.05% senior unsecured debentures due in 2051. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $45.2 billion at June 30, 2020, an increase of approximately $2.6 billion since December 31, 2019. In the first six months of 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new term debt aggregating $5.3 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2062, repaid approximately $1.8 billion of debt and reduced short-term borrowings by approximately $920 million. Over the remainder of 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries will repay debt of approximately $800 million. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. In July 2020, BHE reached a definitive agreement with Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) to acquire substantially all of Dominion’s natural gas transmission and storage business, which includes more than 7,700 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines, about 900 billion cubic feet of operated natural gas storage capacity and partial ownership of a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility. The acquisition price will be approximately $4.0 billion, which will be funded with cash provided by the Berkshire parent company. BHE will also assume approximately $5.7 billion of existing asset-related long-term debt. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2020. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program was amended on July 17, 2018, permitting Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In the first six months of 2020, Berkshire paid $6.7 billion to repurchase shares of Class A and B common stock. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future are not currently reflected in the financial statements, which will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 44 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations (Continued) In the first six months of 2020, Berkshire and its subsidiaries issued new term debt. Principal and interest payments associated with these new term borrowings are expected as follows: in 2020 – $136 million; in 2021 and 2022 – $466 million; in 2023 and 2024 – $982 million; and thereafter – $11.9 billion. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2020 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in the “Contractual Obligations” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2020 includes estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts of $117.5 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude will result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2020 included goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $71.8 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2019. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. In response to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we considered whether goodwill needed to be reevaluated for impairment as of June 30, 2020. While we estimated the fair values of certain reporting units had likely declined since the fourth quarter of 2019, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill for these units was not impaired as of June 30, 2020. However, we also determined it was necessary to quantitively reevaluate goodwill for impairment as of June 30 for other reporting units, and most significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million, of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC. Prior to carrying out the reevaluation, the carrying value of our goodwill in PCC was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets in PCC was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of these amounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. We believe the effects of the pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers continues to be particularly severe. We considered a number of factors in our evaluation, including but not limited to: the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand, employment levels and aircraft orders; announcements by manufactures on reduced aircraft production and the actions we are taking or may take to restructure our operations to fit lower expected demand. Further, in our judgment, the timing and extent of the recovery in the commercial airline and aerospace industries may be dependent on the development and wide-scale distribution of medicines or vaccines that effectively treat the virus. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase the discount rates and reduce our prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing for impairments. The amounts of these adjustments were based on qualitative assessments by Berkshire. 45 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units at this time are significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on the reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict at this time. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could prove to be worse than we currently estimate for these and our other reporting units and could lead us to record goodwill or indefinite-lived asset impairment charges over the second half of 2020. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations, the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of June 30, 2020, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 46 Part II Other Information Item 1A. Risk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 to which reference is made herein. T hese risk factors are supplemented for the items described below . The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses. The outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks may adversely affect, our operations, including our equity securities portfolio. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses. Unfavorable general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital markets at a reasonable cost. Our operating businesses are subject to economic conditions affecting the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate. To the extent that economic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide are depressed by the effects of COVID-19 or otherwise, one or more of our significant operations could be materially harmed. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures, and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the second quarter of 2020 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program May: Class A common stock 540 $ 262,967.67 540 * Class B common stock 18,828,006 $ 174.58 18,828,006 * June: Class A common stock 1,282 $ 268,815.58 1,282 * Class B common stock 7,514,590 $ 178.59 7,514,590 * * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $20 billion. 47 Part II Other Information Item 3.

General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Changes to those policies due to the adoption of new accounting standards are described in Note 2. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, changes in the fair values of certain derivative contract liabilities and gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread rapidly across the world in the first quarter of 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in March and will likely adversely affect nearly all of our operations in the second quarter, although such effects may vary significantly. The duration and extent of the effects over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The risks and uncertainties resulting from the pandemic that may affect our future earnings, cash flows and financial condition include the nature and duration of the curtailment or closure of our various facilities and the long-term effect on the demand for our products and services. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January 1, 2020. ASC 326 provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried at amortized cost based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses therefore include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. We elected to not measure an allowance for expected credit losses on accrued interest and instead reverse uncollectible accrued interest through interest income on a timely basis. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a charge to retained earnings of $ 388 million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses, which was primarily related to our manufactured housing loans. Expected credit losses for such financial assets are based on the net present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of expected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are non-performing or in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality indicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates, historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans, the historical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other matters. In addition, our estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 7 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements (Continued) Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables are primarily short-term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination. In establishing credit loss allowances for such receivables, we primarily utilize credit loss history. However, credit loss allowances may be adjusted as a result of current conditions and when we expect reasonable and supportable forecasts to deviate from historical experience. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses, we review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider credit ratings, right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement including, collateral, funds held arrangements, guarantees and other publicly available information. We adopted ASU 2017-04 “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” as of January 1, 2020. Under ASU 2017-04, the measurement of a goodwill impairment is represented by the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the reporting unit and is limited to the carrying value of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after its adoption date. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts.” ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used to value policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs arising from the issuance of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts, with the effects of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount rate assumptions reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 3. Investments in fixed maturity securities Investments in fixed maturity securities as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are summarized by type below (in millions).

As of March 31, 2020, approximately 88 % of our foreign government holdings were rated AA or higher by at least one of the major rating agencies. The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities at March 31, 2020 are summarized below by contractual maturity dates (in millions). Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to early call or prepayment rights held by issuers.

On August 8, 2019, Berkshire invested a total of $ 10 billion in Occidental Corporation (“Occidental”) newly issued Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $ 10 billion, and warrants to purchase up to 80 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $ 62.50 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8 % per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing on the tenth anniversary of issuance at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, or mandatorily under certain specified capital return events. Dividends on the preferred stock may be paid in cash or, at Occidental’s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. Our investments in Occidental are included in the commercial, industrial and other category in the preceding tables. Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 325,442,152 shares of Kraft Heinz common stock representing 26.6 % of the outstanding shares. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $ 8.1 billion at March 31, 2020 and $ 10.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $ 13.6 billion at March 31, 2020 and $ 13.8 billion at December 31, 2019. As disclosed in Berkshire’s Form 10-Qs for the first three quarters of 2019, Kraft Heinz’s financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2019 were not available until August 13, 2019 when Kraft Heinz filed financial statements for those periods with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Thus, Berkshire did not record equity method earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz for each of those periods until our third quarter of 2019. Our equity method earnings for the first quarter of 2020 were $ 101 million. We received dividends on the common stock of $ 130 million in each of the first quarters of 2020 and 2019, which were recorded as reductions to the carrying value of our investment. 9 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5. Equity method investments (Continued) As of March 31, 2020, the carrying value of our investment in Kraft Heinz exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by $ 5.5 billion ( 40.4 %). In light of that fact, we evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. We utilize no bright-line tests in such evaluations. Based on the available facts and information regarding the operating results of Kraft Heinz, our ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery, the relative amount of the decline, and the length of time that fair value was less than carrying value, we concluded that recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required. However, we will continue to monitor this investment and it is possible that an impairment loss will be recorded in earnings in future periods based on changes in facts and circumstances or intentions. Summarized consolidated financial information of Kraft Heinz follows (in millions). March 28, 2020 December 28, 2019 Assets $ 104,073 $ 101,450 Liabilities 52,949 49,701 First Quarter 2020 2019 Sales $ 6,157 $ 5,959 Net earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz common shareholders 378 405 Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”), and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”). The carrying value of our investments in these entities was approximately $ 3.9 billion as of March 31, 2020 and $ 3.7 billion as of December 31, 2019. Our equity method earnings from these entities in the first quarter were $ 199 million in 2020 and $ 167 million in 2019. Additional information concerning these investments follows. We own a 50 % interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50 % interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through its issuance of commercial paper, which is currently limited to $ 1.5 billion. On March 31, 2020, Berkadia’s commercial paper outstanding was $ 1.47 billion. The commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. In addition, a Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company subsidiary owns a 50 % interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint. American Electric Power owns the other 50 % interest. In 2017, we acquired a 38.6 % interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is one of the largest operators of travel centers in North America, supplying more than 11 billion gallons of fuel per year via more than 900 retail and fueling locations across 44 U.S. states and 6 Canadian provinces. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1 % interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining 11.3 % interest. We also entered into an agreement to acquire in 2023 an additional 41.4 % interest in Pilot with the Haslam family retaining a 20 % interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023. 10 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 6. Investment gains/losses Investment gains/losses in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows (in millions). First Quarter 2020 2019 Equity securities: Unrealized investment gains (losses) on securities held at the end of the period $ ( 68,482 ) $ 19,393 Investment gains (losses) during the period ( 410 ) 161 ( 68,892 ) 19,554 Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains 16 5 Gross realized losses ( 6 ) ( 10 ) Other — 3 $ ( 68,882 ) $ 19,552 Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own. The investment losses in the first quarter of 2020 were predominantly related to a significant decline in equity securities prices on securities we held at March 31, 2020. In the first three months of 2020 and 2019, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $ 2.2 billion and $ 2.1 billion, respectively, from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains/losses on equity securities sold in each period reflect the difference between proceeds from sales and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Our taxable gains on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Taxable gains in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 were $ 1,211 million and $ 518 million, respectively. Note 7.

Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $ 19.0 billion as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. Note 13. Derivative contracts We are party to derivative contracts through certain of our subsidiaries. The most significant derivative contracts consist of equity index put option contracts. The liabilities and related notional values of these contracts follows (in millions). Liabilities Notional Value March 31, 2020 $ 2,361 $ 14,171 December 31, 2019 968 14,385 14 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13. Derivative contracts (Continued) The equity index put option contracts are European style options written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. Notional value in the preceding table represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming the value of each index is zero at each contract’s expiration date. Certain contracts are denominated in foreign currencies and the related notional amounts are based on the foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. We recorded pre-tax losses on these contracts of $ 1,393 million in the first quarter of 2020 and pre-tax gains of $ 770 million in the first quarter of 2019. The losses in the first quarter of 2020 reflected declines of 20 % to 25 % in index values between December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020, with the declines concentrated in the last six weeks of the quarter. Substantially all open contracts as of March 31, 2020 will expire by February 2023 . The weighted average life of unexpired contracts at March 31, 2020 was approximately 1.5 years. Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike price at the expiration date. We received aggregate premiums of $ 2.5 billion on the contract inception dates with respect to unexpired contracts as of March 31, 2020 and we have no counterparty credit risk. The aggregate intrinsic value (the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date) was $ 2.0 billion at March 31, 2020 and $ 397 million at December 31, 2019. These contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the expiration dates and the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses on these contracts will not be determined until the contract expiration dates. Our regulated utility subsidiaries are exposed to variations in the prices of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity purchased and sold and natural gas supplied for customers. We may use forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options to manage a portion of these price risks. Most of the net derivative contract assets or liabilities of our regulated utilities are probable of recovery through rates and are offset by regulatory liabilities or assets. Note 14. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 15), for each of the three months ending March 31, 2020 and 2019 follows (in millions). 2020 2019 Balances – beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 73,019 $ 68,458 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 2,855 ) ( 3,060 ) Net liabilities 70,164 65,398 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events 10,896 9,787 Prior accident years’ events ( 200 ) 112 Total incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 10,696 9,899 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events ( 3,175 ) ( 3,123 ) Prior accident years’ events ( 6,841 ) ( 5,884 ) Total payments ( 10,016 ) ( 9,007 ) Foreign currency translation adjustment ( 372 ) 81 Balances – March 31: Net liabilities 70,472 66,371 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 2,890 3,164 Gross liabilities $ 73,362 $ 69,535 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the preceding table were recorded in earnings in each period and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). We recorded a net reduction of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 200 million in 2020 compared to a net increase of $ 112 million in 2019 which produced a corresponding reduction and increase, respectively, in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. These reductions/increases, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 0.3 % in 2020 and 0.2 % in 2019. 15 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to primary insurance were reduced by $ 172 million in 2020 and $ 100 million in 2019. The decrease in 2020 was primarily attributable to lower than anticipated private passenger automobile and medical professional liability claims. The decrease in 2019 primarily derived from private passenger automobile, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims partially offset by higher other liability losses. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to property and casualty reinsurance were reduced by $ 28 million in 2020 and increased by $ 212 million in 2019. Note 15. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract inception date or, when applicable, once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the three months ending March 31, 2020 and 2019 follows (in millions). 2020 2019 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Balances – beginning of year: $ 42,441 $ ( 13,747 ) $ 41,834 $ ( 14,104 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses Current year contracts — — — — Prior years’ contracts 24 259 2 273 Total 24 259 2 273 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 196 ) — ( 203 ) — Balances – March 31: $ 42,269 $ ( 13,488 ) $ 41,633 $ ( 13,831 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 283 $ 275 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter related to contracts written in prior years were $ 283 million in 2020 and $ 275 million in 2019. Such losses reflected the recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effects of changes in the timing and amount of projected future loss payments. Berkshire’s subsidiary, National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), is party to a contract with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”), in which NICO’s ultimate liability is contractually limited to $ 20 billion. Our estimated ultimate claim liabilities with respect to the AIG contract at both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were $ 18.2 billion. Deferred charge assets related to the AIG contract were approximately $ 6.1 billion at March 31, 2020 and $ 6.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Note 16. Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of March 31, 2020. Weighted Average Interest Rate March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Insurance and other: Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”): U.S. Dollar denominated due 2020 - 2047 3.2 % $ 8,328 $ 8,324 Euro denominated due 2021 - 2035 1.0 % 7,513 7,641 Japanese Yen denominated due 2024 - 2049 0.5 % 3,978 3,938 Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”): U.S. Dollar denominated due 2020 - 2049 4.1 % 8,828 8,679 Great Britain Pound denominated due 2039 - 2059 2.5 % 2,131 2,274 Other subsidiary borrowings due 2020 - 2045 4.1 % 5,241 5,262 Subsidiary short-term borrowings 3.0 % 1,467 1,472 $ 37,486 $ 37,590 16 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16. Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) In March 2020, Berkshire repaid € 1.0 billion of maturing senior notes and issued € 1.0 billion of 0.0 % senior notes due in 2025 . Over the remainder of 2020, there are no other senior note maturities and in the first quarter of 2021, $ 1.6 billion of senior notes will mature. In April 2020, Berkshire issued ¥ 195.5 billion (approximately $ 1.8 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2060 and a weighted average interest rate of 1.07 %. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In January 2020, BHFC repaid $ 350 million of maturing senior notes and in March 2020 issued $ 500 million of 1.85 % senior notes due in 2030 . Over the remainder of 2020, $ 550 million of BHFC senior notes will mature and in the first quarter of 2021, an additional $ 750 million of senior notes will mature. The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 6.85 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 430 billion par) reflect the applicable foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $ 228 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $ 170 million in the first quarter of 2019. In addition to BHFC borrowings, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $ 1.2 billion of other subsidiary borrowings at March 31, 2020. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. Weighted Average Interest Rate March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2021 - 2050 4.5 % $ 11,459 $ 8,581 Subsidiary and other debt due 2020 - 2064 4.5 % 30,035 30,772 Short-term borrowings 2.4 % 2,088 3,214 Burlington Northern Santa Fe and subsidiaries due 2020 - 2097 4.6 % 23,165 23,211 $ 66,747 $ 65,778 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. During the first quarter of 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new term debt of approximately $ 4.0 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2050 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.75 %. In April 2020, a BHE subsidiary issued $ 1.0 billion of term debt consisting of $ 400 million of 2.7 % bonds due in 2030 and $ 600 million of 3.3 % bonds due in 2051 . In the first three months of 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries repaid $ 1.7 billion of debt and reduced short-term borrowings by approximately $ 1.1 billion. BHE subsidiary term debt maturities over the remainder of 2020 approximate $ 800 million. BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In April 2020, BNSF issued $ 575 million of 3.05 % senior unsecured debentures due in 2051 . Over the remainder of 2020, approximately $ 450 million of senior unsecured debentures will mature. As of March 31, 2020, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2020, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $ 8.2 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included approximately $ 6.8 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 17 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 17. Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, other receivables and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of their fair values.

Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 follow (in millions).

Fair Value Principal Valuation Techniques Unobservable Inputs Weighted Average Investments in equity securities: Preferred stock $ 5,540 Discounted cash flow Expected duration 9 years Discount for transferability restrictions and subordination 375 basis points Common stock warrants 2 Warrant pricing model Expected duration 9 years Volatility 27 % Derivative contract liabilities 2,361 Option pricing model Volatility 25 % As described in Note 4, our investments in Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Occidental Preferred”) and Occidental common stock warrants were acquired at an aggregate cost of $ 10 billion. Investments in equity securities in the preceding table include our investments in Occidental Preferred and Occidental common stock warrants. These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. In applying discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the Occidental Preferred, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. The Occidental Preferred is redeemable at Occidental’s option beginning in 2029 . In valuing the Occidental common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. The Occidental common stock warrants expire on the one-year anniversary on which no Occidental Preferred remains outstanding . 19 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 17. Fair value measurements (Continued) Our equity index put option derivative contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. We determine the fair value of the equity index put option contract liabilities based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Note 18. Common stock Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the first quarter of 2020 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Class A, $ 5 Par Value ( 1,650,000 shares authorized) Class B, $ 0.0033 Par Value ( 3,225,000,000 shares authorized) Issued Treasury Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding Balance December 31, 2019 719,307 ( 17,337 ) 701,970 1,408,183,852 ( 23,702,319 ) 1,384,481,533 Conversions of Class A common stock to Class B common stock ( 4,290 ) — ( 4,290 ) 6,435,000 — 6,435,000 Treasury stock acquired — ( 1,342 ) ( 1,342 ) — ( 5,388,663 ) ( 5,388,663 ) Balance at March 31, 2020 715,017 ( 18,679 ) 696,338 1,414,618,852 ( 29,090,982 ) 1,385,527,870 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,620,023 shares outstanding as of March 31, 2020 and 1,624,958 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $ 20 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note 19. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 21.2 % in 2020 and 21.4 % in 2019. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, the magnitude of gains or losses included in earnings with respect to our investments in equity securities, and underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. 20 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 20.

Contingencies and Commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 21 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 23. Revenues from contracts with customers We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 (in millions). Other revenues included in consolidated revenues were primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. Revenues and earnings before income taxes by segment for the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in millions).

We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 24 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Prior to the middle of March, many of our operating businesses were experiencing comparative revenue and earnings increases over 2019. As efforts to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated in the second half of March and continued through April, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Several of our businesses deemed essential have continued to operate, including our railroad, utilities and energy, insurance and certain of our manufacturing, distribution and service businesses. However, revenues of these businesses have slowed considerably in April. Other businesses, including several of our retailing businesses and certain manufacturing and service businesses are being severely impacted due to closures of facilities where crowds can gather, such as retail stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. In response to the effects of the pandemic, we have implemented various business continuity plans to protect our employees and customers. Such plans include a variety of actions, such as temporarily closing certain retail stores, manufacturing facilities and service centers of businesses that were not subject to government mandated closure. In addition, many of our businesses have implemented practices to protect employees while at work. Such practices have included work-from-home, staggered or reduced work schedules, increased cleaning and sanitation of work spaces, providing employee health screening, eliminating non-essential travel and face-to-face meetings and providing general health reminders intended to help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19. We have also taken actions in response to the economic losses from reductions in consumer demand for products and services we offer and our inability to produce goods and provide services at certain of our businesses. These actions have included employee furloughs, wage and salary reductions, capital spending reductions and other actions intended to help mitigate the economic losses and preserve capital and liquidity. While we believe that these necessary actions are temporary, we cannot reliably predict when business activities at our numerous and diverse operations will normalize. We also cannot predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $363 million in the first quarter of 2020. Insurance underwriting results in 2020 included earnings from primary insurance and losses from reinsurance, which were net of gains from foreign currency remeasurement applicable to certain reinsurance liabilities. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased 12.0% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, attributable to higher dividend income. After-tax earnings of our railroad business in the first quarter of 2020 decreased 5.0% compared to 2019. Earnings in 2020 reflected the effects of lower shipping volumes, offset by productivity improvements which lowered operating costs. Revenues and earnings in the first quarter of 2020 were negatively affected by COVID-19. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business decreased 7.3% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses decreased 7.4% in the first quarter of 2020 versus 2019. Earnings of these businesses were generally lower in 2020 attributable to the effects of COVID-19, although such effects varied among our businesses. 24 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment and derivative gains/losses in the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 included significant unrealized losses in 2020 and significant unrealized gains in 2019 from market price changes on our holdings of equity securities. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as a component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held strategy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance operations. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider pre-tax catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million from a current year event as significant. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $116 billion as of March 31, 2020. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, our underwriting results for the first quarter of 2020 were negatively affected by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including estimated provisions for claims and uncollectible premiums and incremental operating costs to maintain customer service levels. The potential effects of the pandemic may be further affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims that we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. We also anticipate our underwriting results in 2020 will be affected from lower premiums for certain business attributable to premium credits granted to policyholders and when premiums are a function of the insured’s payroll. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2020 2019 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss): GEICO $ 984 $ 770 Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (33 ) (30 ) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (489 ) (253 ) Pre-tax underwriting earnings 462 487 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 99 98 Net underwriting earnings $ 363 $ 389 Effective income tax rate 21.5 % 22.5 % GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 9,681 $ 9,263 Premiums earned $ 9,109 100.0 $ 8,622 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 6,766 74.3 6,556 76.1 Underwriting expenses 1,359 14.9 1,296 15.0 Total losses and expenses 8,125 89.2 7,852 91.1 Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 984 $ 770 25 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Premiums written and earned in the first quarter of 2020 increased 4.5% and 5.6%, respectively, compared to 2019. The premium increases were primarily attributable to voluntary auto policies-in-force growth of 6.5% over the past twelve months, partially offset by a decrease in average premiums per auto policy due to coverage changes. The increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force primarily resulted from new business sales and a decrease in the number of policies not renewed. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 380,000 during the first quarter of 2020. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter of 2020 increased $210 million (3.2%) compared to 2019. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to earnings in the first quarter of 2020 was 74.3%, a decrease of 1.8 percentage points from 2019, which reflected declines in claims frequencies and increases in claims severities. Claims frequencies in the first quarter of 2020 were lower for property damage and collision coverages (twelve to fourteen percent range), personal injury coverage (nine to eleven percent range) and bodily injury coverage (six to eight percent range). The declines were attributable to lower policyholder driving as a result of shelter in place actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Average claims severities in the first quarter of 2020 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (seven to nine percent range) and bodily injury coverage (four to six percent range). GEICO’s losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter included reductions in the ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events of $148 million in 2020 and $83 million in 2019. Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2020 were $1.4 billion, an increase of $63 million (4.9%) over 2019. GEICO’s underwriting expense to premiums earned ratio in the first quarter of 2020 was 14.9% compared to 15.0% in 2019. The underwriting expense increase was primarily attributable to higher employee-related costs and increased allowances for uncollectible premiums. In response to the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on policyholders, in March, GEICO implemented a country-wide moratorium on the cancellation of coverage due to non-payment and policy expiration through May 31, 2020. The moratorium will continue on a state-by-state basis determined by individual state mandates. On April 8th, GEICO announced the “GEICO Giveback” credit. The GEICO Giveback will provide a 15 percent premium credit to all voluntary auto and motorcycle policies renewing between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020, as well as to any new policies purchased during the same period. The credits are expected to average $150 per auto policy and $30 per motorcycle policy for an estimated total premium credits of $2.5 billion. The premium credit is in recognition of COVID-19’s economic impact on policyholders as well as the lower loss frequencies due to various local and state shelter in place orders. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), and National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 2,455 $ 2,341 Premiums earned $ 2,369 100.0 $ 2,151 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 1,811 76.4 1,570 73.0 Underwriting expenses 591 25.0 611 28.4 Total losses and expenses 2,402 101.4 2,181 101.4 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ (33 ) $ (30 ) Premiums written and earned in the first quarter of 2020 increased 4.9% and 10.1%, respectively, compared to 2019. The increase in premiums written reflected increases from BH Specialty, GUARD and MedPro Group, which were partly offset by decreases from NICO Primary and BHHC. Premiums from workers’ compensation business declined in the first quarter of 2020, reflecting the effects of increased price competition in the market, lower insured payroll levels from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the divestiture of Applied Underwriters in October 2019. 26 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) BH Primary generated pre-tax underwriting losses of $33 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $30 million in the first quarter of 2019. Underwriting results in the first quarter of 2020 included claim cost estimates and allowances for credit losses attributable to the pandemic, partly offset by lower other underwriting expenses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred also included reductions for prior years’ loss events of $24 million in 2020 and $17 million in 2019, which was net of an increase in estimated ultimate claim liabilities for legacy casualty exposures. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to higher severity and longer claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher than expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings, regulatory actions and other factors not currently anticipated. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and General Re Life Corporation (“General Re”). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN. Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter Premiums earned Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Property/casualty $ 2,723 $ 2,322 $ (162 ) $ (40 ) Life/health 1,354 1,027 (229 ) 280 Retroactive reinsurance 34 3 (42 ) (323 ) Periodic payment annuity 159 194 (56 ) (170 ) $ 4,270 $ 3,546 $ (489 ) $ (253 ) Property/casualty A summary of property/casualty reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

The increase in premiums written was primarily attributable to new business which included $525 million from a property quota-share contract effective in 2020, partially offset by non-renewals and the unfavorable foreign currency effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar. 27 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Property/casualty (Continued) Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter of 2020 increased $346 million (19.5%) over 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected estimated COVID-19 related claims of approximately $230 million in 2020 and relatively insignificant losses from changes in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2019 included no significant losses from catastrophe events and a net increase in estimated ultimate claim liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $212 million. Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 1,355 $ 1,027 Premiums earned $ 1,354 100.0 $ 1,027 100.0 Life and health insurance benefits 1,098 81.1 598 58.2 Underwriting expenses 485 35.8 149 14.5 Total benefits and expenses 1,583 116.9 747 72.7 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ (229 ) $ 280 Life/health premiums earned were $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $327 million (31.8%) compared to 2019. The increase in life/health premiums earned reflected $168 million from a single reinsurance contract covering health insurance risks beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 and volume growth in several international life markets and in U.S. individual life and health business, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar. The life/health business produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $229 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to pre-tax earnings of $280 million in 2019. We incurred pre-tax losses of $234 million in the first quarter of 2020 from the run-off of variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts compared to pre-tax earnings of $89 million in the first quarter of 2019. Underwriting results from this business reflect changes in estimated liabilities for guaranteed benefits, which derive from changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Life/health underwriting results in the first quarter of 2019 included a one-time pre-tax gain of $163 million attributable to the yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract amendment, which effectively eliminated our future exposures under the contract. Underwriting results in the first quarter of 2020 also reflected lower pre-tax earnings from international life business, partially offset by lower pre-tax losses from the run-off of U.S. long-term care business. Retroactive reinsurance There were no significant retroactive reinsurance contracts written in the first quarters of 2020 and 2019. Pre-tax underwriting losses in 2020 and 2019 derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amount of future claim payments, as well as from foreign currency gains/losses arising from the periodic remeasurement of liabilities related to contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies. Pre-tax underwriting results include foreign currency remeasurement gains of $205 million in the first quarter of 2020 and losses of $52 million in 2019. Retroactive reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses of $247 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $271 million in 2019. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $42.3 billion at March 31, 2020 and $42.4 billion at December 31, 2019. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were $13.5 billion at March 31, 2020 and $13.7 billion at December 31, 2019. Deferred charge assets will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization. 28 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums written in the first quarter of 2020 were $159 million, a decrease of $35 million (18.0%) compared to 2019. Periodic payment business is price sensitive. The volumes written can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments and the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include the effects of mortality and interest rate changes and remeasurement gains and losses related to foreign currency denominated liabilities of certain contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries. During the first quarter, pre-tax underwriting results included remeasurement gains of $105 million in 2020 and losses of $28 million in 2019. Excluding foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $161 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $142 million in the first quarter of 2019. Discounted periodic payment annuity liabilities were $13.7 billion at March 31, 2020 and $13.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The weighted average discount rate of these liabilities was 4.0% at March 31, 2020. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2020 2019 Interest and other investment income $ 404 $ 513 Dividend income 1,243 972 Investment income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,647 1,485 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 261 248 Net investment income $ 1,386 $ 1,237 Effective income tax rate 15.8 % 16.6 % Interest and other investment income decreased $109 million (21.2%) in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments. Dividend income in the first quarter of 2020 increased $271 million (27.9%) compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% cumulative preferred stock of Occidental on August 8, 2019 and higher dividend rates on certain common stock investments. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. Short-term interest yields in the U.S. were higher in the first half of 2019. However, those rates declined over the second half of 2019 and continued to decline through the first quarter of 2020. We expect such rates will remain low over the remainder of 2020 and that our earnings from such investments over the remainder of 2020 will be lower than in 2019. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, less insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float was approximately $130 billion on March 31, 2020 and $129 billion on December 31, 2019. Our average cost of float was negative in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 as our underwriting operations generated pre-tax earnings in each period. 29 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 follows (in millions).

Approximately 88% of all foreign government obligations were rated AA or higher. Foreign government securities include obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by national or provincial government entities. Approximately 98% of corporate bond investments were considered investment-grade by the major rating agencies as of March 31, 2020. Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped which includes consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2020 2019 Revenues $ 5,417 $ 5,762 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 1,244 1,400 Fuel 614 711 Purchased services 666 713 Depreciation and amortization 615 591 Equipment rents, materials and other 432 414 Total operating expenses 3,571 3,829 Interest expense 262 268 3,833 4,097 Pre-tax earnings 1,584 1,665 Income taxes 394 412 Net earnings $ 1,190 $ 1,253 Effective income tax rate 24.9 % 24.7 % 30 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) BNSF’s revenues were $5.4 billion in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of $345 million (6.0%) versus 2019. During the first quarter of 2020, BNSF’s revenues reflected a 5.2% decrease in volume and a 0.6% comparative decrease in average revenue per car/unit. Volume in the first quarter of 2020 was 2.34 million cars/units compared to 2.46 million in 2019. Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2020 were approximately $1.6 billion, a decrease of 4.9% compared to 2019. The decrease is principally a result of the negative impact on volumes of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, as well as the effects in the first quarter of 2019 of a revenue increase related to the favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing and a reduction to expense from a retirement plan curtailment gain arising from a plan amendment. BNSF’s service, velocity and cost performance improved significantly in 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019 when severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network negatively affected revenues, expenses and service levels. Revenues from consumer products were $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 11.8% compared to 2019, reflecting lower average revenue per car/unit and volume decreases of 7.2%. The volume decreases were driven by lower international intermodal volumes as the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to lower U.S. West Coast imports. Volumes further decelerated late in the quarter in the domestic intermodal and automotive segments as the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact to U.S. consumers intensified. Revenues from industrial products were $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 0.5% from 2019. The decrease was attributable to a volume decrease of 2.3%, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower sand volumes driven by increased competition from locally-sourced (“in-basin”) sand and due to lower liquefied petroleum gas volume attributable to increased pipeline takeaway capacity. These decreases were partially offset by higher demand for petroleum products. Revenues from agricultural products were $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 2.8% compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher volumes of 3.3%, primarily due to higher domestic grain and soybean meal shipments, partially offset by lower grain exports. Revenues from coal were $766 million in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 11.9% compared to 2019. This decrease reflected lower average revenue per car/unit and lower volumes of 7.7%. Volumes decreased primarily due to the effects of low natural gas prices, mild winter weather and plant retirements. Operating expenses were $3.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of $258 million (6.7%) compared to 2019. The ratio of operating expenses to revenues decreased 0.6 percentage points to 65.9% in the first quarter of 2020 versus 2019. BNSF's expenses in 2020 reflected lower volume-related costs, productivity improvements and improved weather conditions compared to the first quarter of 2019, offset by a reduction to expense in the first quarter of 2019 from the pension plan curtailment gain. Compensation and benefits expense decreased $156 million (11.1%) for the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to lower employee counts associated with lower volume and improved productivity. Purchased service expenses decreased $47 million (6.6%) in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to insurance recoveries in 2020 related to the flooding in 2019. Fuel expenses decreased $97 million (13.6%) in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to improved efficiency, lower volumes and lower average fuel prices. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $18 million (4.3%) in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, due to the effects of the pension plan curtailment gain in the first quarter of 2019, offset by lower volume-related costs, personal injury expense, casualty-related costs, miscellaneous taxes and the effects of cost controls in 2020. BNSF is an important part of the national and global supply chain, and as an essential business it has continued to operate throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the pandemic is expected to cause an economic slowdown that could be significant and, therefore, could adversely affect the demand for BNSF’s services. The pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, and the extent to which it may impact BNSF’s business, operating results, financial condition or liquidity will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. We believe BNSF has sufficient liquidity to continue business operations during this volatile period. Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We currently own 91.1% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. 31 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are largely based on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2020 2019 Revenues: Energy operating revenue $ 3,634 $ 3,825 Real estate operating revenue 893 785 Other income (loss) (20 ) 62 Total revenue 4,507 4,672 Costs and expense: Energy cost of sales 1,038 1,214 Energy operating expense 1,711 1,651 Real estate operating costs and expense 873 806 Interest expense 466 461 Total costs and expense 4,088 4,132 Pre-tax earnings 419 540 Income tax expense (benefit)* (201 ) (130 ) Net earnings after income taxes 620 670 Noncontrolling interests 3 3 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway Energy 617 667 Noncontrolling interests 56 62 Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 561 $ 605 Effective income tax rate (48.0 )% (24.1 )% * Includes significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation. The discussion of BHE’s operating results that follows is based on after-tax earnings, reflecting how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated. A summary of net earnings attributable to BHE follows (in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) PacifiCorp PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. After-tax earnings were $176 million in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of $4 million (2.2%) compared to 2019. The decline reflected lower utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales), lower other income and higher interest expense, partly offset by increased allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction and increased income tax benefits from production tax credits from repowering certain existing wind-powered generating facilities. Utility margin was $789 million in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of $5 million compared to 2019, mainly attributable to lower operating revenue from lower average rates and volumes, which declined 1.7%, due in part to the impacts of weather. The lower operating revenue was largely offset by lower coal-fueled and natural gas-fueled generation costs. MidAmerican Energy Company MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings were $150 million in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of $40 million (21.1%) as compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower electric and natural gas utility margins and lower other income, partially offset by increased income tax benefits from higher production tax credits driven by repowering existing facilities and new wind projects placed in-service. Electric utility margin in the first quarter of 2020 declined 9% to $391 million, primarily due to lower average retail rates from business mix changes, decreased wholesale revenue from lower volumes and prices and unfavorable retail customer volumes of 0.7%, as lower residential volumes from the impacts of weather were largely offset by a 7.7% increase in industrial volumes. The electric utility margin decrease was partially offset by lower generation and purchased power costs. Natural gas utility margin declined 21% due to a 16.2% reduction in retail customer volumes, primarily due to milder weather conditions in 2020. NV Energy NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings were $20 million in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of $9 million (31.0%) compared to 2019. The decrease reflected lower other income and higher depreciation and amortization expense, partly offset by lower interest expense. Electric utility margin in the first quarter of 2020 was $323 million, relatively unchanged versus 2019, as retail customer volumes, including distribution only customers, increased 0.2%, primarily attributable to an increase in the average number of customers. Northern Powergrid After-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2020 increased 8.8% as compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher distribution revenues of $8 million, attributable to higher tariff rates, partly offset by a 1.8% decline in distributed units. Natural gas pipelines After-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2020 decreased $2 million (1.1%) compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to increased operating expenses and higher net interest expense, partially offset by higher transportation revenues from expansion projects. Other energy businesses After-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2020 were $136 million, an increase of $45 million (49.5%) compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation. Real estate brokerage After-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2020 increased $32 million compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher after-tax earnings from mortgage, brokerage and settlement services in large part attributable to a more favorable interest rate environment, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Corporate interest and other After-tax earnings decreased $79 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to state income tax benefits recognized in 2019 and lower other income in 2020. 33 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter Revenues Earnings * 2020 2019 2020 2019 Manufacturing $ 15,035 $ 15,070 $ 2,111 $ 2,194 Service and retailing 18,777 19,224 623 732 $ 33,812 $ 34,294 Pre-tax earnings 2,734 2,926 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 696 726 $ 2,038 $ 2,200 Effective income tax rate 25.1 % 24.5 % * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which were primarily from the amortization of identified intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings in the preceding table were $202 million in 2020 and $192 million in 2019. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page 24 and in the “Other” earnings section on page 38. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. The industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (“CTB”)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (“LSPI”)). Marmon includes UTLX Company (“UTLX”), which provides various products and services (including equipment leasing) for the rail and mobile crane industries. The building products group includes homebuilding and manufactured housing finance (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2020 2019 2020 2019 Industrial products $ 7,358 $ 7,677 $ 1,306 $ 1,431 Building products 4,857 4,562 567 482 Consumer products 2,820 2,831 238 281 $ 15,035 $ 15,070 $ 2,111 $ 2,194 Industrial products Revenues of the industrial products group were $7.4 billion in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 4.2% from 2019. Pre-tax earnings of the group were $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2020, a decline of 8.7% compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 17.7% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 18.6% in 2019. PCC’s revenues were $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of $173 million (6.6%) compared to 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, PCC experienced lower sales across all of its major markets. The decline in aerospace sales was primarily attributable to volume reductions in new programs, such as LEAP, associated with Boeing’s decision to temporarily suspend production of the 737 MAX aircraft, lower market share within the aerostructures business and reduced shipments to customers affected by COVID-19 across the world. 34 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products (Continued) PCC’s pre-tax earnings decreased 7.3% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. The earnings decrease reflected the decline in sales of aerospace products and higher than normal production costs associated with meeting required customer deliveries on new and legacy programs. The increased production costs were due to manufacturing inefficiencies primarily attributable to COVID-19. Lubrizol’s revenues were $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of $72 million (4.3%) compared to 2019. The decline reflected lower volumes. A fire at Lubrizol’s Rouen, France manufacturing, blending and storage facility at the end of the third quarter of 2019 resulted in the suspension of operations. Although these operations were partially restarted in December 2019, volumes continued to be negatively affected in 2020. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume in the first quarter of 2020 declined 4% from 2019, primarily due to a volume decline of 5% in the Additives product lines. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings decreased 9.3% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Earnings in the first quarter of 2020 continue to be negatively impacted by costs and lost business associated with the Rouen fire and lower selling prices. These negative impacts were partially offset by lower average raw material costs and favorable product mix. Marmon’s revenues were $2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2020, substantially unchanged from 2019. Revenues decreased due to lower volumes in the Transportation Products, Retail Solutions, Metal Services, and Foodservice Technology sectors, lower metal prices in the Electrical and Metal Services sectors, the effect of 2019 divestitures and unfavorable foreign currency translation. These decreases were offset by the effect of the 2019 acquisition of Colson Medical Companies, other acquisitions in the Rail & Leasing, Transportation Products and Crane sectors, higher volumes in the Electrical and Plumbing & Refrigeration sectors, and increased revenues in the Rail & Leasing sector on higher railcar equipment sales and railcar fleet utilization. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2020 increased $2 million (0.7%) compared to 2019. The increase reflected the effects of business acquisitions and higher earnings in the Rail & Leasing sector and increased other income, offset by lower earnings in the Transportation Products and Crane Services sectors, and increases in restructuring charges and interest expense. IMC’s revenues were $842 million in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 5.1% compared to 2019. The revenue decline was attributable to the negative effects of COVID-19 in Asia during the first quarter and in other regions of the world in the latter part of March, and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by the effects of business acquisitions over the past year. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 22.3% in the first quarter of 2020 versus 2019, as a result of the impact of the sales decline and changes in sales mix. Building products Revenues of the building products group were approximately $4.9 billion in the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $295 million (6.5%) compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings of the group were $567 million in the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 17.6% over 2019. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 11.7% and 10.6% in the first quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $208 million (13.4%) over 2019. The comparative increase was primarily due to an increase in home sales of $173 million (15.3%), reflecting a net increase in units sold and changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 24% in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to business acquisitions. Manufactured home unit sales increased 12%, primarily attributable to increased wholesale sales. Interest income from lending activities in the first quarter of 2020 increased 6.3% compared to 2019. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $15.5 billion as of March 31, 2020 compared to $15.9 billion as of December 31, 2019. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $201 million in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of $14 million (6.7%) compared to 2019. The earnings decline reflected increased provisions for expected credit losses, partly offset by comparatively higher earnings from home building activities and increased interest income, net of interest expense. The increase in credit loss provisions was primarily related to COVID-19. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $3.1 billion in the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 2.9% versus 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher paint and coatings volumes (including volumes with Ace Hardware Stores), increased roofing and insulation system volumes and product mix changes. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were $366 million in the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 37.8% over 2019. Earnings in the first quarter of 2020 benefitted from a combination of lower facilities closure costs, higher average gross margins for flooring products, the effects of the aforementioned increases in sales volumes and operating cost control initiatives. 35 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Consumer products Consumer products revenues were $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 0.4% versus 2019. Footwear and apparel sales declined 6.1% in the first quarter of 2020 and were substantially offset by revenue increases by Forest River (3.8%) and Duracell (5.7%). Our apparel and footwear businesses experienced lower sales volumes, reflecting the effects of COVID-19 that prompted temporary retail store closures and reduced or cancelled orders and from the ongoing shift by certain major retailers towards private label products. Consumer products pre-tax earnings were $238 million in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 15.3% compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the first quarter were 8.4% in 2020 and 9.9% in 2019. The decrease in pre-tax earnings reflected a 34% decline in earnings from footwear and apparel, which included inventory obsolescence allowances related to COVID-19. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (in millions). First Quarter Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2020 2019 2020 2019 Service $ 3,358 $ 3,418 $ 425 $ 472 Retailing 3,598 3,607 133 149 McLane Company 11,821 12,199 65 111 $ 18,777 $ 19,224 $ 623 $ 732 Service Our service business group offers fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI), franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen) and offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG) and until the time of their sale on March 16, 2020, the publishing of newspapers. Service group revenues were approximately $3.4 billion in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 1.8% compared to 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, revenues of TTI were relatively unchanged from 2019, while FlightSafety’s revenues increased slightly and NetJets revenues decreased slightly from 2019. The decrease in NetJets revenues in the first quarter of 2020 reflected lower flight hours, partly offset by an increase in the number of aircraft on lease. Pre-tax earnings of the service group were $425 million in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of $47 million (10.0%) compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 12.7% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 13.8% in 2019. The comparative decline in earnings reflected lower earnings from TTI, FlightSafety, XTRA and CORT. TTI’s earnings decline was attributable to lower gross margin rates. Earnings from NetJets increased in the first quarter of 2020, primarily attributable to improved fleet and operating efficiencies, which improved operating margins over the first two months of 2020. However, the spread of COVID-19 had a significant impact on NetJets’ and FlightSafety’s operations during March and April. Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”), which consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Other retailing businesses include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. Other retailing businesses also include three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories. 36 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing (Continued) Retailing group revenues were $3.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, relatively unchanged compared to 2019. BHA’s revenues in the first quarter of 2020, which represented approximately 65% of our combined retailing revenues, decreased 0.9% from 2019. BHA’s revenue decrease reflected a 1.5% decrease in new and pre-owned vehicle sales, partly offset by increased vehicle finance and service contract revenue and vehicle service revenue as compared to 2019. Home furnishings group revenues, which represented about 21% of the aggregate retailing group revenues, increased 2.3% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings of the retail group were $133 million in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 10.7% from 2019. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 3.6%, primarily due to increased earnings from finance and service contract activities and lower floorplan interest expense, partly offset by lower vehicle sales margins. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined $19 million compared to the first quarter of 2019. The spread of COVID-19 throughout the U.S. resulted in the temporary closures of many of our retail store operations and significantly lower volumes for those operations that remained open. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised approximately 67% of McLane’s consolidated sales in the first quarter of 2020 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues were $11.8 billion in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 3.1% compared to 2019. Revenues in the first quarter of 2020 decreased 2% in the grocery business and 6% in the foodservice business as compared to 2019. Pre-tax earnings decreased $46 million (41.4%) as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease in the first quarter of 2020 included charges of $17 million for expected credit losses and inventory losses in the foodservice operations related to COVID-19 and lower sales and gross margin rates in the grocery operations. McLane continues to operate in an intensely competitive business environment, which is negatively affecting its current operating results. Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains/losses follows (dollars in millions). First Quarter 2020 2019 Investment gains (losses) $ (68,882 ) $ 19,552 Derivative gains (losses) (1,393 ) 770 Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests (70,275 ) 20,322 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests (14,658 ) 4,216 Net gains (losses) $ (55,617 ) $ 16,106 Effective income tax rate 20.8 % 20.7 % Investment gains/losses As a result of a change to GAAP effective in 2018, we are required to include the unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities in our reported earnings. While this accounting standard does not change the effect on our consolidated shareholders’ equity or total comprehensive income, it has significantly increased the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment losses in the first quarter of 2020 included net unrealized losses on equity securities we owned on March 31, 2020 of approximately $68.5 billion. Pre-tax gains in the first quarter of 2019 included $19.4 billion in net unrealized gains on equity securities we owned on March 31, 2019. The unrealized losses in the first quarter of 2020 reflected the widespread declines in equity securities prices in the U.S. and internationally. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold in the first quarter, which is the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $1.2 billion in 2020 and $518 million in 2019. 37 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment gains/losses (Continued) Investment gains/losses from periodic changes in securities prices will continue to cause significant volatility in our consolidated earnings. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe that the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. Substantially all remaining contracts will expire by February 2023. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant due to the volatility of market prices in the underlying equity markets. As of March 31, 2020, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was approximately $2.0 billion and our recorded liability at fair value was $2.4 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. Pre-tax losses from equity index put option contracts were $1,393 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to pre-tax gains of $770 million in the first quarter of 2019. The losses in 2020 were attributable to the sharp declines in equity index values. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). First Quarter 2020 2019 Equity method earnings $ 256 $ 166 Acquisition accounting expenses (202 ) (192 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (96 ) (74 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes 175 134 Income tax expense adjustment — (377 ) Other, principally corporate investment income 200 214 Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 333 $ (129 ) After-tax equity method earnings include Berkshire’s share of earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. As discussed in Note 5 to the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, financial results of Kraft Heinz for the first quarter of 2019 were not made available to us until the third quarter of 2019. Accordingly, our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2019 does not include our share of Kraft Heinz’s earnings for that period. After-tax earnings related to our Kraft Heinz investment were $99 million for the first quarter of 2020. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and BHFC. As of March 31, 2020, outstanding borrowings included senior notes of €6.85 billion par, ¥430 billion par and £1.75 billion par. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce non-cash unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The income tax expense adjustment in the first quarter of 2019 relates to investments that we made between 2015 and 2018 in certain tax equity investment funds, which aggregated approximately $340 million. In December 2018 and during the first quarter of 2019, we learned of allegations by federal authorities of fraudulent income conduct by the sponsor of these funds and in January 2020, the principals involved in creating the investment funds plead guilty to criminal charges related to the sale of the investments. In the first quarter of 2019, we concluded it was more likely than not that the income tax benefits that we recognized prior to 2019 were not valid. 38 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at March 31, 2020 was $371.6 billion, a decrease of $53.2 billion since December 31, 2019. Net loss attributable to Berkshire shareholders in the first three months of 2020 was $49.7 billion, which included after-tax losses on our investments of approximately $54.5 billion that were primarily due to decreases in market prices of the equity securities we owned at March 31, 2020. Our operating business groups are preparing for reduced cash flows from reduced revenues and economic activity as a result of COVID-19. We are taking measures to reduce costs as appropriate through the measures previously described in this Report. While we cannot reliably predict when all of our businesses will become fully operational, we currently believe our liquidity and capital strength, which is extremely strong, to be adequate. At March 31, 2020, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills (net of amounts payable for acquired but not yet settled purchases) of $124.7 billion, which included $105.5 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $198.7 billion. Additionally, during the month of April we received approximately $6.1 billion from the sales of equity securities, net of the costs of equity securities purchased. The proceeds from these activities have been primarily reinvested in U.S. Treasury Bills. Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at March 31, 2020 was $19.8 billion, relatively unchanged since December 31, 2019. In March 2020, Berkshire repaid maturing senior notes of €1.0 billion and issued €1.0 billion of 0.0% senior notes due in 2025. In April 2020, Berkshire issued ¥195.5 billion of senior notes (approximately $1.8 billion), which has a weighted average interest rate of 1.07% and maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2060. Over the remainder of 2020, there are no other Berkshire senior note maturities. In the first quarter of 2021, senior notes of $1.6 billion will mature. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $17.7 billion at March 31, 2020, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $11.0 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our UTLX railcar leasing business. In January 2020, BHFC repaid $350 million of maturing senior notes and in March 2020, BHFC issued $500 million of 1.85% senior notes due in 2030. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. Over the next 12 months, approximately $1.3 billion of BHFC senior notes will mature. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of these two operations in the first three months of 2020 were $2.0 billion and we currently forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $8.8 billion over the remainder of 2020. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.2 billion as of March 31, 2020, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2019. In April 2020, BNSF issued $575 million of 3.05% senior unsecured debentures due in 2051. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $43.6 billion at March 31, 2020, an increase of approximately $1.0 billion since December 31, 2019. In the first three months of 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new term debt aggregating $4.0 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2050, repaid approximately $1.7 billion of term debt and reduced short-term borrowings by approximately $1.1 billion. In April 2020, a BHE subsidiary issued $1.0 billion of term debt consisting of $400 million of 2.7% bonds due in 2030 and $600 million of 3.3% bonds due in 2051. Over the remainder of 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries will repay approximately $800 million of maturing term debt. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program was amended on July 17, 2018, permitting Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In the first three months of 2020, Berkshire paid $1.7 billion to repurchase shares of Class A and B common stock. 39 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future are not currently reflected in the financial statements, which will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the first three months of 2020, Berkshire and its subsidiaries issued new term debt. Principal and interest payments associated with these new term borrowings are expected as follows: in 2020 – $103 million; in 2021 and 2022 – $317 million; in 2023 and 2024 – $317 million; and thereafter – $7.2 billion. In April 2020, Berkshire and certain other subsidiaries issued new term debt aggregating $3.4 billion with maturities ranging from 2023 to 2060. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2020 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in the “Contractual Obligations” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2020 includes estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts of $116 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude will result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2020 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $82 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $19 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2019. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results may vary significantly from the forecasts. In response to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we considered whether goodwill needed to be reevaluated for impairment as of March 31, 2020, including goodwill for certain reporting units where the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by less than 20% as of the most recent annual impairment test. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units at this time are significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on the reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict at this time. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. We considered the available facts and made qualitative assessments and judgements for what we believed represent reasonably possible outcomes. While the fair values of certain of these reporting units declined since the time that the tests were conducted in the fourth quarter of 2019, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill was not impaired as of March 31, 2020. However, COVID-19 pandemic events will continue to evolve and the negative effects on our companies could prove to be worse than we currently estimate and lead us to record goodwill or indefinite-lived asset impairment charges prior to the next annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2020. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 40 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations, the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of March 31, 2020, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 41 Part II Other Information Item 1A. Risk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 to which reference is made herein. T hese risk factors are supplemented for the items described below . The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment. Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses. The outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks may adversely affect, our operations, including our equity securities portfolio. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses. Unfavorable general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital markets at a reasonable cost. Our operating businesses are subject to economic conditions affecting the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate. To the extent that economic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide are depressed by the effects of COVID-19 or otherwise, one or more of our significant operations could be materially harmed. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures, and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the first quarter of 2020 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program January 3 through January 15: Class A common stock 177 $ 339,082.41 177 * Class B common stock 582,074 $ 226.11 582,074 * February 24 through February 28: Class A common stock 164 $ 325,411.91 164 * Class B common stock 4,486,775 $ 214.00 4,486,775 * March 2 through March 10: Class A common stock 1,001 $ 301,085.61 1,001 * Class B common stock 319,814 $ 214.18 319,814 * * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $20 billion. 42 Part II Other Information Item 3.

Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2019 Note 1. General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. As described in the Annual Report, we modified certain presentations to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Presentations in these interim Consolidated Financial Statements conform to the presentations in the Annual Report. Changes to those policies due to the adoption of a new accounting standard are described in Note 2. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. In light of the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, changes in the fair values of certain derivative contract liabilities and gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements Berkshire adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842 “Leases” on January 1, 2019. Most significantly, ASC 842 requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make lease payments and an asset with respect to its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Upon the adoption of ASC 842, we recognized operating lease assets of approximately $ 6.2 billion and lease liabilities of $ 5.9 billion. We also reduced other assets by approximately $ 300 million. Consequently, our consolidated assets and liabilities increased by approximately $ 5.9 billion. We are party to contracts where we lease property from others (“lessee” contracts) and where we lease property to others (“lessor” contracts). In adopting and applying ASC 842, we elected to use practical expedients, including but not limited to, not reassessing past lease and easement accounting, not separating lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and not recording assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less. We adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 with regard to leases in effect as of that date and elected to not restate prior period financial statements. ASC 842 did not have a material effect on our accounting for lessor contracts or for lessee contracts classified as financing leases. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate. The lease term is generally the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage or changes in an index or interest rates. Options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment. 8 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements (Continued) On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-01 “Financial Instruments—Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” ASU 2018-02 “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” and ASC 606 “Revenues from Contracts with Customers.” Prior year financial statements were not restated. A summary of the effects of the initial adoption of ASU 2016-01, ASU 2018-02 and ASC 606 on our shareholders’ equity follows (in millions). ASU 2016-01 ASU 2018-02 ASC 606 Total Increase (decrease): Accumulated other comprehensive income $ ( 61,459 ) $ 84 $ — $ ( 61,375 ) Retained earnings 61,459 ( 84 ) ( 70 ) 61,305 Shareholders’ equity — — ( 70 ) ( 70 ) With respect to ASU 2016-01, beginning in 2018, unrealized gains and losses from the changes in the fair values of our equity securities during the period are included within investment gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of January 1, 2018, we reclassified net after-tax unrealized gains on equity securities from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. In adopting ASU 2018-02, we reclassified the stranded deferred income tax effects arising from the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that were included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of January 1, 2018 to retained earnings. In adopting ASC 606, we recorded increases to certain assets and other liabilities, with the cumulative net effect recorded to retained earnings. Prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized revenues from the sales of fractional ownership interests in aircraft over the term of the related management services agreements, as the transfers of the ownership interests were inseparable from the management services agreements. These agreements also include provisions that require us to repurchase the fractional interest at fair market value at contract termination or upon the customer’s request following the end of a minimum commitment period. ASC 606 provides that such contracts are subject to accounting guidance for lease contracts. The principal effects of this re-characterization were to increase equipment held for lease and aircraft repurchase liabilities and unearned lease revenues by approximately $ 3.5 billion. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-13 “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses,” which provides for the recognition and measurement at the reporting date of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost and for available-for-sale debt securities. Currently, credit losses are recognized and measured when such losses become probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. ASU 2016-13 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” ASU 2017-04 eliminates the requirement to determine the implied value of goodwill in measuring an impairment loss. Upon adoption of ASU 2017-04, the measurement of a goodwill impairment will represent the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value and will be limited to the carrying value of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts.” ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used to value policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs arising from the issuance of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts, with the effects of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount rate assumptions reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 provides for new disclosures and is expected to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 as a result of a recent decision by the FASB, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 9 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.

Investments in equity securities (Continued) On April 30, 2019, Berkshire committed to invest a total of $ 10 billion in connection with Occidental Petroleum Corporation’s (“Occidental”) proposal to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (“Anadarko”). The Anadarko shareholders approved the acquisition by Occidental on August 8, 2019 and the acquisition and our investment in Occidental closed on August 8, 2019. Berkshire’s investments in Occidental include newly issued Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $ 10 billion, together with warrants to purchase up to 80 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $ 62.50 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8 % per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing on the tenth anniversary of issuance at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, or mandatorily under certain specified capital return events. Dividends on the preferred stock may be paid in cash or, at Occidental’s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. Our investments in Occidental are included in the commercial, industrial and other category in the preceding table. Cost Basis Net Unrealized Gains Fair Value December 31, 2018* Banks, insurance and finance $ 44,332 $ 38,260 $ 82,592 Consumer products 38,783 22,838 61,621 Commercial, industrial and other 19,752 8,792 28,544 $ 102,867 $ 69,890 $ 172,757 * Approximately 68 % of the aggregate fair value was concentrated in five companies (American Express Company – $ 14.5 billion; Apple Inc. – $ 40.3 billion; Bank of America Corporation – $ 22.6 billion; The Coca-Cola Company – $ 18.9 billion and Wells Fargo & Company – $ 20.7 billion). Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 325,442,152 shares of Kraft Heinz common stock representing 26.6 % of the outstanding shares. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $ 9.1 billion at September 30, 2019 and $ 14.0 billion at December 31, 2018. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $ 13.8 billion at both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. As discussed in Berkshire’s first and second quarter Form 10-Qs, Kraft Heinz’s financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2019 were not available and thus we excluded our share of Kraft Heinz’s earnings and other comprehensive income from our consolidated results during those periods. On August 13, 2019, Kraft Heinz filed financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2019 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Kraft Heinz has also made its financial results for the third quarter of 2019 available to Berkshire. Accordingly, Berkshire’s equity method earnings in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 included $ 467 million attributable to Kraft Heinz’s results for the first nine months of 2019 , of which $ 228 million was attributable to Kraft Heinz’s results for the first six months. Equity method earnings from Kraft Heinz for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 were $ 168 million and $ 635 million, respectively. Dividends received from Kraft Heinz in the first nine months of 2019 and 2018 were $ 391 million and $ 610 million, respectively, which were recorded as reductions to the carrying value of our investment. We evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment as of September 30, 2019. Based on the available facts and information, the length of time that fair value was less than carrying value and our ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery, we concluded that recognition of an impairment loss in earnings at September 30, 2019 was not required. However, we will continue to monitor this investment and it is possible that an impairment loss will be recorded in earnings in future periods based on changes in facts and circumstances or intentions. 11 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5. Equity method investments (Continued) Summarized consolidated financial information of Kraft Heinz follows (in millions). September 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Assets $ 102,822 $ 103,461 Liabilities 51,016 51,683 Third Quarter First Nine Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 Sales $ 6,076 $ 6,383 $ 18,441 $ 19,377 Net earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz common shareholders 899 619 1,753 2,376 Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC, d/b/a Pilot Flying J (“Pilot Flying J”), and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”). The carrying value of our investments in these entities was approximately $ 3.7 billion as of September 30, 2019 and $ 3.5 billion as of December 31, 2018. Our equity method earnings in these entities in the first nine months were $ 491 million in 2019 and $ 409 million in 2018. Additional information concerning these investments follows. We own a 50 % interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50 % interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through its issuance of commercial paper, which is currently limited to $ 1.5 billion. On September 30, 2019, Berkadia’s commercial paper outstanding was $ 1.47 billion. The commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. In addition, a Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company subsidiary owns a 50 % interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint. American Electric Power owns the other 50 % interest. On October 3, 2017, we entered into an investment agreement and an equity purchase agreement whereby we acquired a 38.6 % interest in Pilot Flying J, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot Flying J is one of the largest operators of travel centers in North America, with more than 28,000 team members, 750 locations across the U.S. and Canada, and nearly $ 30 billion in annual revenues. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1 % interest in Pilot Flying J and a third party owns the remaining 11.3 % interest. We also entered into an agreement to acquire in 2023 an additional 41.4 % interest in Pilot Flying J with the Haslam family retaining a 20 % interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot Flying J in 2023. Note 6. Investment gains/losses Investment gains/losses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 and 2018 are summarized as follows (in millions). ` Third Quarter First Nine Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 Equity securities: Unrealized investment gains (losses) on securities held at the end of the period $ 10,489 $ 14,294 $ 39,546 $ 12,126 Investment gains (losses) during the period 135 244 464 307 10,624 14,538 40,010 12,433 Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains 59 44 71 451 Gross realized losses ( 2 ) ( 10 ) ( 18 ) ( 152 ) Other 11 ( 3 ) 16 18 $ 10,692 $ 14,569 $ 40,079 $ 12,750 12 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 6. Investment gains/losses (Continued) Prior to 2018, we recognized investment gains and losses in earnings when we sold equity securities based on the difference between the sale proceeds and the cost of the securities and also when we recognized other-than-temporary impairment losses. Beginning in 2018, equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own. Prior to 2018, we recorded the changes in unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities in other comprehensive income. In the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $ 7.1 billion and $ 14.2 billion, respectively, from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains/losses on equity securities sold in each period reflect the difference between proceeds from sales and the fair value of the equity security sold at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Our taxable gains on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Taxable gains in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 were $ 609 million and $ 1,959 million, respectively, and in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 were $ 1,329 million and $ 2,688 million, respectively. Note 7. Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are summarized as follows (in millions). September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Loans and finance receivables before allowances and discounts $ 17,462 $ 16,622 Allowances for uncollectible loans ( 183 ) ( 177 ) Unamortized acquisition discounts ( 144 ) ( 165 ) $ 17,135 $ 16,280 Loans and finance receivables are principally installment loans originated or acquired by our manufactured housing business. Provisions for loan losses for the first nine months were $ 109 million in both 2019 and 2018. Loan charge-offs, net of recoveries in the first nine months, were $ 103 million in 2019 and $ 106 million in 2018. At September 30, 2019, approximately 98 % of the manufactured housing loan balances were evaluated collectively for impairment, with the remainder evaluated individually. As part of the evaluation process, credit quality indicators are reviewed and loans are designated as performing or non-performing. At September 30, 2019, we considered approximately 99 % of the loan balances to be performing and approximately 96 % of the loan balances to be current as to payment status. Additionally, during 2018, an insurance subsidiary entered into an agreement with Seritage Growth Properties to provide a $ 2.0 billion term loan facility, which matures on July 31, 2023 . As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the outstanding loans under the facility were approximately $ 1.6 billion. Note 8.

Leases We are party to contracts where we lease property from others. As a lessee, we primarily lease office and operating facilities, locomotives, freight cars, energy generation facilities and transmission assets. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as of September 30, 2019 were $ 5,996 million and $ 5,852 million, respectively, and were included in other assets and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The weighted average term of these leases was approximately 7.5 years and the weighted average discount rate used to measure lease liabilities was approximately 3.9 %.

Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $ 18.8 billion as of September 30, 2019 and $ 18.9 billion as of December 31, 2018 and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. Note 14. Derivative contracts We are party to derivative contracts through certain of our subsidiaries. Currently, the most significant derivative contracts consist of equity index put option contracts. The liabilities and related notional values of these contracts follows (in millions). Liabilities Notional Value September 30, 2019 $ 1,236 $ 23,042 December 31, 2018 2,452 26,759 Notional value represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming the value of each index is zero at each contract’s expiration date. Certain contracts are denominated in foreign currencies and the related notional amounts are based on the foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Pre-tax gains from equity index put option contracts were $ 234 million and $ 1,217 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, and $ 137 million and $ 303 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. 16 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14. Derivative contracts (Continued) The equity index put option contracts are European style options written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. The remaining contracts expire between October 2019 and October 2025 . The weighted average life of unexpired contracts at September 30, 2019 was approximately 1.3 years. Contracts with notional values of $ 9.0 billion will expire in the fourth quarter of 2019. Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike price at the expiration date. We received aggregate premiums of $ 3.6 billion on the contract inception dates with respect to unexpired contracts at September 30, 2019 and we have no counterparty credit risk. The aggregate intrinsic value (the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date) was $ 626 million at September 30, 2019 and $ 1,653 million at December 31, 2018. These contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the expiration dates and the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses on these contracts will not be determined until the contract expiration dates. A limited number of our equity index put option contracts contain collateral posting requirements with respect to changes in the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts and/or a downgrade of Berkshire’s credit ratings. As of September 30, 2019, we did not have any collateral posting requirements. If Berkshire’s credit ratings (currently AA from Standard & Poor’s and Aa2 from Moody’s) are downgraded below either A- by Standard & Poor’s or A3 by Moody’s, collateral of up to $ 1.1 billion could be required to be posted. Our regulated utility subsidiaries are exposed to variations in the prices of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity purchased and sold and natural gas supplied for customers. We may use forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options to manage a portion of these price risks. Most of the net derivative contract assets or liabilities of our regulated utilities are probable of recovery through rates and are offset by regulatory liabilities or assets. Derivative contract assets are included in other assets and were $ 144 million as of September 30, 2019 and $ 172 million as of December 31, 2018. Derivative contract liabilities are included in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities and were $ 96 million as of September 30, 2019 and $ 111 million as of December 31, 2018. Note 15. Supplemental cash flow information A summary of supplemental cash flow information is presented in the following table (in millions). First Nine Months 2019 2018 Cash paid during the period for: Income taxes $ 4,395 $ 3,977 Interest: Insurance and other 879 934 Railroad, utilities and energy 2,149 2,129 Non-cash investing and financing activities: Liabilities assumed in connection with business acquisitions 147 93 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 526 — 17 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under short-duration property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences on or before the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. Reconciliations of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 17), for each of the nine months ending September 30, 2019 and 2018 follow (in millions). 2019 2018 Balances – beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 68,458 $ 61,122 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 3,060 ) ( 3,201 ) Net liabilities 65,398 57,921 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events 31,179 29,071 Prior accident years’ events ( 396 ) ( 1,566 ) Total incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 30,783 27,505 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events ( 13,144 ) ( 12,474 ) Prior accident years’ events ( 13,967 ) ( 11,516 ) Total payments ( 27,111 ) ( 23,990 ) Foreign currency translation adjustment ( 178 ) ( 117 ) Balances – September 30: Net liabilities 68,892 61,319 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 3,105 2,944 Gross liabilities $ 71,997 $ 64,263 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first nine months of 2019 and 2018 included net decreases of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 396 million and $ 1,566 million, respectively. Increases and decreases in estimated ultimate liabilities produce corresponding decreases and increases to pre-tax earnings. The reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years’ events for the first nine months as percentages of net liabilities at the beginning of the respective year were 0.6 % in 2019 and 2.7 % in 2018. In the first nine months of 2019, we lowered estimated ultimate liabilities of primary insurance for prior years’ events by $ 321 million, compared to $ 985 million in 2018. Reductions of estimated liabilities in the first nine months of 2019 were lower than the first nine months of 2018 with respect to private passenger automobile and medical malpractice insurance. In addition, we increased estimated liabilities in the first nine months of 2019 for legacy casualty exposures and other commercial insurance business. In the first nine months of 2019, we decreased estimated ultimate property and casualty reinsurance liabilities for prior years’ events by $ 75 million, compared to $ 581 million in the first nine months of 2018. The decreases in prior years’ incurred losses in each year derived primarily from property claims. 18 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 17. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Depending on the contract terms, claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the nine months ending September 30, 2019 and 2018 follows (in millions). 2019 2018 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Balances – beginning of year: $ 41,834 $ ( 14,104 ) $ 42,937 $ ( 15,278 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses Current year contracts 175 ( 82 ) — — Prior years’ contracts ( 2 ) 827 ( 36 ) 827 Total 173 745 ( 36 ) 827 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 643 ) — ( 966 ) — Balances – September 30: $ 41,364 $ ( 13,359 ) $ 41,935 $ ( 14,451 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 918 $ 791 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first nine months related to contracts written in prior years were $ 825 million in 2019 and $ 791 million in 2018. Such losses reflected the periodic amortization of deferred charge assets and the effects of changes in the timing and amount of ultimate claim liabilities. In 2017, National Indemnity Company (“NICO”) entered into a contract with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”). Our estimated ultimate claim liabilities with respect to the AIG contract at both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were $ 18.2 billion. Deferred charge assets related to the AIG contract were approximately $ 6.4 billion at September 30, 2019 and $ 6.9 billion at December 31, 2018. Note 18. Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of September 30, 2019. Weighted Average Interest Rate September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Insurance and other: Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) In September 2019, Berkshire issued ¥ 430.0 billion of senior notes consisting of ¥ 108.5 billion of 0.17 % senior notes due in 2024 , ¥ 61.0 billion of 0.27 % senior notes due in 2026 , ¥ 146.5 billion of 0.44 % senior notes due in 2029 , ¥ 19.0 billion of 0.787 % senior notes due in 2034 , ¥ 59.0 billion of 0.965 % senior notes due in 2039 and ¥ 36.0 billion of 1.108 % senior notes due in 2049 . Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. BHFC repaid $ 3.95 billion of maturing senior notes in the first nine months of 2019. In January 2019, BHFC issued $ 2.0 billion of 4.25 % senior notes due in 2049 . In June 2019, BHFC also issued £ 1.75 billion of senior notes consisting of £ 1.0 billion of 2.375 % senior notes due in 2039 and £ 750 million of 2.625 % senior notes due in 2059 . The carrying values of our non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€ 6.85 billion, £ 1.75 billion and ¥ 430 billion par) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $ 447 million in the first nine months of 2019 and $ 273 million in the first nine months of 2018. In addition to BHFC borrowings, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $ 1.3 billion of other subsidiary borrowings at September 30, 2019. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. Weighted Average Interest Rate September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2020 - 2049 4.6 % $ 8,580 $ 8,577 Subsidiary and other debt due 2019 - 2064 4.5 % 29,329 28,196 Short-term borrowings 2.8 % 3,119 2,516 Burlington Northern Santa Fe and subsidiaries due 2019 - 2097 4.6 % 23,990 23,226 $ 65,018 $ 62,515 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. During the first nine months of 2019, BHE and its subsidiaries issued approximately $ 3.4 billion of long-term debt. The debt issued in 2019 has maturity dates ranging from 2029 to 2050 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.9 %. Proceeds from these debt issuances were used to repay debt, to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In July 2019, BNSF issued $ 825 million of 3.55 % senior unsecured debentures due in 2050 . As of September 30, 2019, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2019, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $ 7.2 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included approximately $ 5.7 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 20 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19.

Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 follow (in millions). Gains (losses) included in: Balance – beginning of year Earnings Other comprehensive income Regulatory assets and liabilities Acquisitions, dispositions and settlements Balance – September 30 Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities: 2019 $ 307 $ 499 $ — $ — $ 10,002 $ 10,808 2018 6 — — — ( 1 ) 5 Net derivative contract assets (liabilities): 2019 ( 2,343 ) 1,528 ( 1 ) ( 40 ) ( 282 ) ( 1,138 ) 2018 ( 2,069 ) 446 — ( 11 ) ( 141 ) ( 1,775 ) Quantitative information as of September 30, 2019, with respect to assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follows (in millions). Fair Value Principal Valuation Techniques Unobservable Inputs Weighted Average Investments in equity securities: Preferred stocks $ 10,363 Discounted cash flow Expected duration 10 years Discount for transferability restrictions and subordination 375 basis points Common stock warrants 136 Warrant pricing model Expected duration 10 years Derivative contract liabilities 1,236 Option pricing model Volatility 16 % Investments in equity securities at September 30, 2019 included our investments in Occidental preferred stock and common stock warrants (see Note 4). These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. In applying discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the perpetual preferred stock, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment, as the issuer may have the right to redeem or convert the stock. We also made estimates regarding the impact of subordination, as the preferred stock has a lower priority in liquidation than debt instruments of the issuer. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment. Increases or decreases to these inputs would result in decreases or increases to the fair value of the investments. 22 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19. Fair value measurements (Continued) Our equity index put option derivative contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts and certain of the contracts have relatively long durations. For these and other reasons, we classified these contracts as Level 3 measurements. The methods we use to value these contracts are those that we believe market participants would use in determining exchange prices with respect to our contracts. We value equity index put option contracts based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to this model include index price, contract duration and dividend and interest rate inputs (including a Berkshire non-performance input) which are observable. However, we believe that the valuation of long-duration options using any model is inherently subjective and, given the lack of observable transactions and prices, acceptable values may be subject to wide ranges. Volatility inputs represent our expectations, which consider the remaining duration of each contract and assume that the contracts will remain outstanding until the expiration dates. Increases or decreases in the volatility inputs will produce increases or decreases in the fair values of the liabilities. Note 20. Common stock Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the first nine months of 2019 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Class A, $ 5 Par Value ( 1,650,000 shares authorized) Class B, $ 0.0033 Par Value ( 3,225,000,000 shares authorized) Issued Treasury Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding Balance December 31, 2018 742,213 ( 12,897 ) 729,316 1,373,558,983 ( 6,138,909 ) 1,367,420,074 Conversions of Class A common stock to Class B common stock and exercises of replacement stock options ( 18,581 ) — ( 18,581 ) 28,137,369 — 28,137,369 Treasury stock acquired — ( 1,752 ) ( 1,752 ) — ( 11,454,833 ) ( 11,454,833 ) Balance at September 30, 2019 723,632 ( 14,649 ) 708,983 1,401,696,352 ( 17,593,742 ) 1,384,102,610 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,631,718 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2019 and 1,640,929 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding. For several years, Berkshire had a common stock repurchase program that permitted Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. On July 17, 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the program, permitting Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $ 20 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. 23 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 21. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 were 18.7 % and 20.2 %, respectively. Our effective income tax rates were 19.2 % and 19.1 % in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings and underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. In the first quarter of 2019, we recorded income tax expense of $ 377 million for uncertain tax positions related to investments in certain tax equity investment funds that generated income tax benefits from 2015 through 2018. We now believe that it is more likely than not those income tax benefits are not valid. Note 22.

Contingencies and Commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise from other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 24 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 24. Revenues from contracts with customers On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 “Revenues from Contracts with Customers.” Under ASC 606, revenues are recognized when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 and 2018 (in millions). Other revenues included in consolidated revenues were primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues which are not within the scope of ASC 606.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. The accompanying business segment information for the 2018 periods reflects certain reclassifications to conform to presentations as of December 31, 2018. Specifically, business units that previously were reported as the finance and financial products segment in the 2018 periods were reclassified to manufacturing (Clayton Homes and UTLX), services and retailing (CORT and XTRA leasing) and corporate and other (principally investment income). Revenues and earnings before income taxes by segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions).

We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $440 million in the third quarter and $1,182 million in the first nine months of 2019. Insurance underwriting results in the first nine months of 2019 include earnings from primary insurance and losses from reinsurance, reflecting lower gains from reductions of claim liability estimates for prior years’ property/casualty loss events and lower gains from foreign currency remeasurement applicable to certain reinsurance liabilities than in 2018. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased 19.8% in the third quarter and 20.5% in the first nine months of 2019 over the same periods in 2018. These increases reflect higher short-term interest income and dividend income. After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 5.2% in the third quarter and 5.5% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 2018. Earnings in 2019 were negatively affected by persistent flooding conditions and severe winter weather, which negatively affected operating costs and freight volumes. During the third quarter, the company placed back into service all key routes impacted by flooding. Earnings in 2019 benefited from higher rates per car/unit, a curtailment gain related to an amendment to defined benefit retirement plans and ongoing operating cost control initiatives. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 8.0% in the third quarter and 5.9% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the corresponding 2018 periods. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased approximately 2% in both the third quarter and first nine months over the same periods in 2018. Operating results of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2019 were mixed, with several of these businesses experiencing lower earnings in 2019. Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2019 of certain of these businesses were negatively affected by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar, international trade tensions and U.S. trade tariffs. Investment and derivative gains/losses in 2019 and 2018 included significant unrealized gains from market price changes on our holdings of equity securities. After-tax unrealized gains on equity securities were approximately $8.0 billion in the third quarter and $30.1 billion in the first nine months of 2019 and were approximately $10.2 billion in the third quarter and $7.5 billion in the first nine months of 2018. After-tax investment gains in 2019 also included after-tax realized gains on sales of equity and fixed maturity securities of $513 million in the third quarter and $1.6 billion in the first nine months. After-tax realized gains on sales of equity and fixed maturity securities in 2018 were $995 million in the third quarter and $2.3 billion in the first nine months. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or settlements or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 28 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as a component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held philosophy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods. Accordingly, we believe that such gains and losses are not necessarily meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance operations. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider pre-tax losses in excess of $100 million from a current year event as significant. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were $113.4 billion as of September 30, 2019. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss): GEICO $ 376 $ 627 $ 1,539 $ 1,977 Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 52 (163 ) (305 ) (124 ) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 153 135 290 468 Pre-tax underwriting earnings 581 599 1,524 2,321 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 141 158 342 530 Net underwriting earnings $ 440 $ 441 $ 1,182 $ 1,791 Effective income tax rate 24.1 % 25.9 % 23.0 % 22.6 % GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Premiums written in 2019 increased 5.1% in the third quarter and 5.8% in the first nine months compared to the corresponding periods in 2018. Premiums earned in 2019 increased 5.8% in the third quarter and 7.2% in the first nine months compared to the corresponding 2018 periods. The premium increases were primarily attributable to voluntary auto policies-in-force growth of 5.6% over the past twelve months, as average premiums per auto policy were relatively unchanged. The increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force primarily resulted from an increase in new business sales of 10.6% and a decrease in the number of policies not renewed. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 846,000 during the first nine months of 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2019 increased 9.2% in the third quarter to $7.3 billion and 9.7% in the first nine months to $21.2 billion. GEICO’s ratios of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 were 81.6% and 80.0%, respectively, increases of 2.5 percentage points over the third quarter and 1.9 percentage points over the first nine months of 2018. The loss ratio increases in 2019 reflected continuing increases in loss severities, slightly offset by lower storm-related losses. Claims frequencies in the first nine months of 2019 declined for property damage and collision coverages (two to three percent range) and personal injury protection coverage (two to four percent range) compared to 2018 and were relatively unchanged for bodily injury coverage. Average claims severities in the first nine months of 2019 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (six to eight percent range). GEICO reduced ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events by $47 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $478 million in the first nine months of 2018. These reductions produced corresponding pre-tax underwriting gains. The reduction in claim loss estimates in 2019 was primarily due to lower than expected losses from property damage and collision claims, partly offset by higher than expected losses from personal injury protection claims. Underwriting expenses in the first nine months of 2019 were $3.8 billion, an increase of $349 million (10.2%) over 2018. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in the first nine months of 2019 was 14.2%, an increase of 0.3 percentage points compared to 2018. The underwriting expense increase was primarily attributable to increases in advertising expenses, insurance premium taxes and employee-related costs, which reflected wage and staffing increases. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and General Re Life Corporation (collectively, “General Re”). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN. With the exception of our retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity product lines, we strive to generate pre-tax underwriting profits. Time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity premiums due to the expected long durations of the associated liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from these products through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Property/casualty A summary of property/casualty reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 2,435 $ 2,201 $ 8,304 $ 7,636 Premiums earned $ 2,614 100.0 $ 2,157 100.0 $ 7,237 100.0 $ 6,479 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 1,659 63.5 1,514 70.2 4,888 67.5 4,315 66.6 Underwriting expenses 641 24.5 576 26.7 1,877 26.0 1,629 25.1 Total losses and expenses 2,300 88.0 2,090 96.9 6,765 93.5 5,944 91.7 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ 314 $ 67 $ 472 $ 535 Property/casualty premiums written increased 10.6% in the third quarter and 8.7% in the first nine months of 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018. Premiums earned in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 increased $457 million (21.2%) and $758 million (11.7%), respectively, versus 2018. The increases in premiums written reflected overall growth in U.S. and international markets. The growth was primarily attributable to new business, net of non-renewals, and increased participations for renewal business, partly offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar. Premiums earned in the first nine months included $1,286 million in 2019 and $1,347 million in 2018 from a 10-year, 20% quota-share contract between NICO with Insurance Australia Group Limited, which expires in 2025. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 increased $145 million (9.6%) and $573 million (13.3%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first nine months of 2019 included a net decrease in estimated ultimate claim liabilities attributable to prior years’ loss events of approximately $75 million compared to $581 million in 2018. Such decreases as percentages of the related net unpaid claim liabilities as of the beginning of the applicable year were 0.25% in 2019 and 2% in 2018. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first nine months of 2019 also reflected an overall 7.0 percentage point decline in the loss ratio attributable to the current accident year as compared to 2018. Incurred losses in the third quarter included $281 million in 2019 related to Typhoon Faxia in Japan and $267 million in 2018 related to Hurricane Florence and Typhoon Jebi. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Typhoon Hagibis struck Japan and caused widespread damage, which certain industry models presently estimate insured losses will likely exceed $8 billion. While we cannot reasonably estimate our losses from this event at this time, we expect our underwriting results in the fourth quarter will be negatively affected. Retroactive reinsurance There were no significant retroactive reinsurance contracts written in the first nine months of 2019 or 2018. Pre-tax underwriting losses in 2019 and 2018 derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amount of future claim payments, as well as from foreign currency gains arising from the periodic re-measurement of liabilities related to contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies. Pre-tax foreign currency re-measurement gains were $84 million in the third quarter and $73 million in the first nine months of 2019 and were $35 million in the third quarter and $99 million in the first nine months of 2018. Retroactive reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains of $824 million in the first nine months of 2019 and $803 million in 2018, and included deferred charge amortization of $480 million in 2019 and $454 million in 2018 related to the reinsurance agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. entered into in 2017. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $41.4 billion at September 30, 2019 and $41.8 billion at December 31, 2018. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were $13.4 billion at September 30, 2019 and $14.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Deferred charge assets will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization. 31 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

In the first quarter of 2019, BHLN amended a yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract with a major U.S. reinsurer. The amendment effectively eliminated BHLN’s future exposures under the contract. BHLN recorded a reduction in earned premiums on this contract of $49 million in the first nine months of 2019 attributable to the contract amendment, while premiums earned related to this contract were $666 million for the first nine months of 2018. Life/health premiums earned in 2019 also reflected volume growth in several international life markets, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower U.S. life and medical supplement volumes. The life/health business produced pre-tax underwriting income of $19 million in the third quarter and $310 million in the first nine months of 2019. Underwriting results in the third quarter of 2019 included lower earnings from the run-off of variable annuity guarantee contracts. Results for the first nine months of 2019 also included a one-time pre-tax gain of $163 million attributable to the BHLN contract amendment in the first quarter, primarily from reductions of benefits incurred. Variable annuity guarantee contracts produced pre-tax losses of $18 million in the third quarter and earnings of $83 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to earnings of $66 million in the third quarter and $166 million in the first nine months of 2018. Underwriting results from this business reflect changes in estimated liabilities for guaranteed benefits, which derive from changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Pre-tax underwriting earnings in 2019 also included losses from increased disability benefit liabilities in Australia in the second quarter, attributable to higher claims experience and changes to various underlying assumptions, and an increase in life claims in North America, partially offset by increased earnings from other international life business. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in the first nine months of 2019 were $652 million, a decrease of $242 million (27.1%) compared to 2018. Periodic payment business is price sensitive. The volumes written can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, and the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include the effects of mortality and interest rate changes and re-measurement gains and losses related to foreign currency denominated liabilities of certain contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax re-measurement gains were $61 million in the third quarter and $70 million in the first nine months in 2019 compared to $21 million in the third quarter and $57 million in the first nine months of 2018. Excluding foreign currency re-measurement gains, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $152 million in the third quarter and $406 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $113 million in the third quarter and $336 million in the first nine months of 2018. Discounted annuity liabilities were $13.2 billion at September 30, 2019 and $12.5 billion at December 31, 2018, reflecting a weighted average discount rate of approximately 4.1%. 32 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), and National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Applied Underwriters (which was sold in October 2019), Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company, acquired October 1, 2018. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 2,824 $ 2,227 $ 7,535 $ 6,498 Premiums earned $ 2,387 100.0 $ 2,050 100.0 $ 6,825 100.0 $ 5,921 100.0 Losses and loss adjustment expenses 1,583 66.3 1,419 69.2 4,721 69.2 3,884 65.6 Underwriting expenses 651 27.3 496 24.2 1,814 26.6 1,569 26.5 Total losses and expenses 2,234 93.6 1,915 93.4 6,535 95.8 5,453 92.1 Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ 153 $ 135 $ 290 $ 468 Premiums written in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 increased 26.8% and 16.0%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018. The comparative year-to-date increase was primarily attributable to GUARD (25.8%), BH Specialty (24.1%) and the impact of the MLMIC acquisition, while aggregate premiums written in 2019 by other BH Primary operations were relatively unchanged from 2018. The increases in premiums earned in 2019 reflected volume increases over the past year. BH Primary produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $290 million in the first nine months of 2019 and $468 million in the first nine months of 2018. BH Primary’s aggregate loss ratios for the first nine months were 69.2% in 2019 and 65.6% in 2018. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the first nine months included reductions for prior years’ loss events of $274 million in 2019 and $507 million in 2018. The net gains from the reductions of prior accident years’ liabilities in 2019 were generally lower compared to 2018 across the various BH Primary operations, due in part to additional estimated claim liabilities recorded in the first quarter of 2019 for legacy casualty exposures. Underwriting results in the third quarter of 2018 included estimated losses from Hurricane Florence of approximately $75 million. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to higher severity and longer claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher than expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 Interest and other investment income $ 556 $ 495 $ 1,646 $ 1,346 Dividend income 1,226 960 3,270 2,706 Investment income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,782 1,455 4,916 4,052 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 298 216 829 659 Net investment income $ 1,484 $ 1,239 $ 4,087 $ 3,393 Effective income tax rate 16.6 % 14.7 % 16.7 % 16.2 % 33 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Interest and other investment income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 increased $61 million (12.3%) and $300 million (22.3%), respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2018. The comparative increases were primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term investments and interest from a term loan with Seritage Growth Properties. For the first nine months, the increase in interest income was partially offset by lower income earned from limited partnership investments. Dividend income in 2019 increased $266 million (27.7%) in the third quarter and $564 million (20.8%) in the first nine months compared to the corresponding 2018 periods. The increases in dividend income were attributable to an overall increase in investment levels over the past year, including the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% cumulative preferred stock of Occidental on August 8, 2019 (see Note 4 to the accompanying unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements), and higher dividend rates on common stock investments. We continue to hold large balances of cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills. While short-term interest yields in the U.S. were higher in the first half of 2019 compared to 2018, interest rates began to decline in the third quarter. Accordingly, earnings from such balances may be lower in the fourth quarter than in prior quarters of 2019. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float was approximately $127 billion at September 30, 2019 and $123 billion at December 31, 2018. Our average cost of float was negative in the first nine months of 2019 as our underwriting operations generated pre-tax earnings of $1.5 billion. A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 follows (in millions).

Non-investment grade securities represent securities rated below BBB- or Baa3. Foreign government securities include obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by national or provincial government entities. 34 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped which includes consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 Revenues $ 6,021 $ 6,147 $ 17,676 $ 17,649 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 1,337 1,378 4,071 4,021 Fuel 725 859 2,211 2,456 Purchased services 687 718 2,087 2,124 Depreciation and amortization 602 580 1,788 1,726 Equipment rents, materials and other 458 471 1,334 1,501 Total operating expenses 3,809 4,006 11,491 11,828 Interest expense 271 262 806 774 4,080 4,268 12,297 12,602 Pre-tax earnings 1,941 1,879 5,379 5,047 Income taxes 475 486 1,322 1,200 Net earnings $ 1,466 $ 1,393 $ 4,057 $ 3,847 Effective income tax rate 24.5 % 25.9 % 24.6 % 23.8 % BNSF’s revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 were $6.0 billion and $17.7 billion, respectively, representing a decrease of $126 million (2.0%) and an increase of $27 million (0.2%) versus the corresponding periods in 2018. During the first nine months of 2019, revenues reflected a 4.5% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit, driven by increased rates per car/unit. Aggregate volumes were 2.65 million cars/units in the third quarter and 7.68 million cars/units in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 2.72 million cars/units in the third quarter and 7.99 million cars/units in the first nine months of 2018. Pre-tax earnings were $1.9 billion and $5.4 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, increases of 3.3% and 6.6%, respectively, compared to the corresponding 2018 periods. BNSF experienced severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network, which has negatively affected revenues, expenses and service levels. BNSF’s earnings in the first nine months of 2019 also benefitted from a revenue increase related to the favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing and a reduction to expense for a curtailment gain arising from an amendment to the defined benefit retirement plans in the first quarter, as well as lower operating expenses attributable to lower volume and cost control initiatives. Revenues from consumer products were $2.0 billion in the third quarter and $5.9 billion in the first nine months of 2019, representing a decrease of 1.4% and an increase of 0.6%, respectively, from the corresponding periods in 2018. Average revenue per car/unit in 2019 was essentially unchanged for the third quarter and higher for the first nine months. Volumes in 2019 decreased 1.2% in the third quarter and 4.4% in the first nine months. The volume decreases were driven by overall lower demand and the availability of truck capacity, as well as from lower international intermodal market share. Revenues from industrial products were $1.6 billion in the third quarter and $4.6 billion for the first nine months of 2019, increases of 0.8% and 5.0%, respectively, from comparable 2018 periods. The revenue increases reflected higher average revenue per car/unit and volume decreases of 2.9% in the third quarter and 0.6% in the first nine months of 2019. Volumes decreased primarily due to overall softness in the industrial sector, lower sand volumes, and reduced car loadings due to the challenging weather conditions in 2019. Strength in the energy sector, which drove higher demand for petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas, partially offset the decreases in other volumes. 35 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Revenues from agricultural products in 2019 increased 0.1% in the third quarter to $1.2 billion and were unchanged in the first nine months at $3.5 billion, when compared to the same periods in 2018. The comparative results reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, offset by volume decreases of 5.7% in both periods. The volume decreases were attributable to export competition from non-U.S. sources, the impacts of changes in international trade policies, and the challenging weather conditions in 2019. Revenues from coal in 2019 decreased 6.8% in the third quarter to $1.0 billion and 6.1% in the first nine months to $2.7 billion compared to 2018. The decreases reflected lower average revenue per car/unit and volume decreases of 4.0% in the third quarter and 4.5% in the first nine months of 2019. Volumes were impacted by adverse weather conditions as well as from the effects of lower natural gas prices. Total operating expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 were $3.8 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively, decreases of $197 million (4.9%) and $337 million (2.8%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018. Our ratio of operating expenses to revenues decreased 1.9 percentage points to 63.3% in the third quarter and 2.0 percentage points to 65.0% in the first nine months of 2019 versus the corresponding prior year periods. BNSF’s expenses in 2019 reflected lower volume-related costs, the effects of several cost control initiatives, and a retirement plan curtailment gain, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of adverse weather conditions. Compensation and benefits expense decreased $41 million (3.0%) for the third quarter and increased $50 million (1.2%) for the first nine months of 2019 . The decrease for the third quarter was primarily due to lower volume-related costs and cost control initiatives. The increase for the first nine months was driven by wage inflation and higher average employee counts offset by the effects of lower volume and cost control initiatives. F uel expenses decreased $134 million (15.6%) for the third quarter and $245 million (10.0%) for the first nine months of 2019 primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes in both periods, and favorable fuel efficiency in the third quarter. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $13 million (2.8%) for the third quarter and $167 million (11.1%) for the first nine months of 2019 as compared to the same periods in 2018. The decrease in the first nine months was driven by a $120 million curtailment gain from the amendment to company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans. BNSF’s effective income tax rate was 24.5% and 24.6% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, as compared to 25.9% and 23.8%, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2018. The effective income tax rates in 2018 included the impact of various state income tax rate reductions enacted during the second quarter. The effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 includes the favorable impact of a completed state audit. Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We currently own 90.9% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. In addition, BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. 36 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. The legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) was enacted in December 2017, which reduced the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In 2018, BHE’s regulated subsidiaries began passing the benefits of lower income tax expense attributable to the TCJA to customers through various regulatory mechanisms, including lower rates, higher depreciation and reductions to rate base. Revenues and earnings of BHE are summarized below (dollars in millions).

Revenues and other income in the third quarter of 2019 were $1.4 billion, relatively unchanged from 2018, and were $3.9 billion in the first nine months, an increase of 2% over the first nine months of 2018. Retail revenues in the first nine months of 2019 increased $81 million compared to 2018, reflecting higher average rates ($65 million) and business mix changes. Wholesale and other revenues in the first nine months of 2019 decreased $34 million due to lower volumes and other income increased in the first nine months of 2019 primarily due to higher allowances for equity funds used during construction. Pre-tax earnings were $275 million in the third quarter of 2019, a decline of $44 million (14%) from 2018, and were $703 million in the first nine months, relatively unchanged from 2018. Utility margin (operating revenues less cost of fuel and energy) was $2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2019, an increase of 1% compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings in the third quarter of 2019 included additional depreciation expense of $65 million due to a state regulatory order that accelerated depreciation on certain retired wind equipment due to repowering activities. Under the order, this pre-tax charge was offset by reduced income tax expense. The changes in earnings reflected the improved utility margin, lower operations and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and lower net interest and finance expenses. PacifiCorp’s after-tax earnings were $278 million in the third quarter and $626 million in the first nine months of 2019, increases of 3% and 4%, respectively, over 2018. 37 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) MidAmerican Energy Company MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. Revenues and other income were $823 million in the third quarter of 2019, a decrease of 4% compared to 2018, and $2.4 billion in the first nine months, an increase of 1% versus the same period in 2018. Electric operating revenues were $712 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $1.8 billion in the first nine months, each relatively unchanged from 2018. Natural gas revenues decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 versus the same periods in 2018, primarily due to decreased volumes. Revenues and other income also increased $38 million in the first nine months of 2019, primarily from increased allowances for equity funds used during construction and higher nonregulated utility construction services revenues. Pre-tax earnings were $199 million in the third quarter of 2019, a decline of $52 million (21%) versus 2018, and were $336 million in the first nine months, a decrease of $11 million (3%) compared to 2018. Electric utility margin in the third quarter of 2019 increased 2% to $599 million and in the first nine months increased 4% to $1.5 billion. The increases in electric utility margin were more than offset by increased depreciation, operations and maintenance expenses and interest. MEC’s after-tax earnings are greater than its pre-tax earnings due to the significant production tax credits related to its wind-powered generating facilities. MEC’s after-tax earnings were $279 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $622 million in the first nine months, decreases of $200 million (42%) and $63 million (9%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018, reflecting decreases in tax credits recognized. NV Energy NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. Revenues were $1.1 billion in the third quarter and $2.4 billion in the first nine months of 2019, decreases of 1% and 2%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018. Electric operating revenues decreased $9 million in the third quarter and $38 million in the first nine months of 2019 versus 2018, primarily attributable to lower retail revenue, reflecting lower customer volumes and reductions related to the TCJA that were effective April 1, 2018, partially offset by higher rates resulting from increased pass-through cost adjustments. Pre-tax earnings decreased $7 million (3%) in the third quarter and $2 million (1%) in the first nine months of 2019 as compared to 2018. Electric utility margin was $592 million in the third quarter and $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2019, decreases of $32 million and $58 million, respectively, compared to 2018, primarily due to lower retail operating revenues. The declines in electric utility margin and increases in depreciation in 2019 were mostly offset by lower operations and maintenance expenses. NV Energy’s after-tax earnings were $206 million in the third quarter and $316 million in the first nine months of 2019, increases of 2% over each of the corresponding 2018 periods. Northern Powergrid Revenues decreased $3 million in the third quarter and $19 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar in 2019, partially offset by higher distribution and smart meter revenues. Pre-tax earnings decreased $11 million in the third quarter and increased $9 million in the first nine months of 2019 as compared to 2018, reflecting changes in the timing and amount of pension settlement losses and lower revenues. 38 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) Natural gas pipelines Revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 declined $30 million (11%) and $56 million (6%), respectively, compared to 2018. The third quarter decline was due to lower transportation revenues of $30 million. The decrease in the first nine months was primarily due to lower gas sales ($58 million) related to system balancing activities at Northern Natural Gas (largely offset in cost of sales) and lower transportation revenues of $3 million, which included a reduction of $26 million from lower contract rates (largely offset by lower depreciation and amortization) and refunds related to the TCJA, substantially offset by higher volumes and rates. Pre-tax earnings were $86 million in the third quarter and $387 million in the first nine months of 2019, a decrease of $18 million (17%) and an increase of $11 million (3%), respectively, compared to 2018. The earnings decrease in the third quarter was primarily due to the decrease in transportation revenues, partly offset by a comparative decrease in operating expenses. The earnings increase in the first nine months was primarily due to the increase in transportation revenues from higher volumes and rates and favorable margins from system rebalancing activities, partly offset by comparative increases in deprecation and operating expenses. Other energy businesses Other energy revenues and other income declined $6 million (1%) in the third quarter and $67 million (4%) in the first nine months of 2019 as compared to the same periods in 2018. The declines were primarily due to increased losses from tax equity renewable energy investments of $13 million for the third quarter and $48 million for the first nine months (largely due to increased investments) and lower operating revenues from non-regulated services. Pre-tax earnings increased $5 million in the third quarter and decreased $58 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The decrease in the comparative earnings for the first nine months is a result of the increase in tax equity investment losses. The pre-tax losses from these investments are included in revenues and are substantially offset by income tax benefits. Results for the first nine months of 2019 also included increased earnings from AltaLink, L.P. and lower operating earnings from renewable energy and the non-regulated service business, attributable to higher operating expenses and depreciation from renewable energy and lower non-regulated service business margin. After-tax earnings from other energy activities were $228 million in the third quarter and $466 million in the first nine months of 2019, increases of $42 million and $26 million, respectively, versus 2018. Real estate brokerage Revenues increased 7% in the third quarter and 5% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The increases were attributable to recent business acquisitions and higher mortgage revenues, partly offset by a 5% year-to-date decrease in closed units at existing brokerage businesses. Pre-tax earnings increased 35% in the third quarter and 13% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 2018. The year-to-date increase was primarily due to the increase in mortgage net revenues and earnings from acquired businesses, partially offset by lower earnings at existing brokerage businesses. Corporate interest Corporate interest includes interest on unsecured debt issued by the BHE holding company. Corporate interest in the first nine months of 2019 increased 5% compared to 2018, primarily due to higher average borrowings. Income taxes BHE’s effective income tax rates for the first nine months of 2019 and 2018 were approximately (20.6%) and (12.5%), respectively. BHE’s effective income tax rates regularly reflect significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation placed in service by our domestic regulated utilities and other energy businesses. The effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2019 decreased primarily due to an increase in recognized production tax credits and favorable impacts of rate making in 2019, partially offset by benefits recognized in 2018 related to foreign earnings and the accrued repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the TCJA. 39 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months Revenues Earnings * Revenues Earnings * 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Manufacturing $ 15,897 $ 15,686 $ 2,484 $ 2,369 $ 47,173 $ 46,335 $ 7,205 $ 7,105 Service and retailing 19,982 20,052 689 745 59,079 58,790 2,225 2,208 $ 35,879 $ 35,738 $ 106,252 $ 105,125 Pre-tax earnings 3,173 3,114 9,430 9,313 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 718 703 2,288 2,289 $ 2,455 $ 2,411 $ 7,142 $ 7,024 Effective income tax rate 22.1 % 22.1 % 23.7 % 24.1 % * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which were primarily from the amortization of identified intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings in the preceding table were $201 million in the third quarter and $581 million in first nine months of 2019, compared to $199 million in the third quarter and $637 million in the first nine months of 2018. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page 28 and in the “Other” earnings section on page 46. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. The industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (“CTB”)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (“LSPI”)). Marmon includes UTLX Company (“UTLX”), which provides various products and services (including equipment leasing) for the rail and mobile crane industries. The building products group includes homebuilding and manufactured housing finance (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and the Duracell Company (“Duracell”), a manufacturer of high performance alkaline batteries. This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months Revenues Pre-tax earnings Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Industrial products $ 7,716 $ 7,673 $ 1,458 $ 1,449 $ 23,280 $ 23,143 $ 4,441 $ 4,481 Building products 5,281 4,969 696 580 15,212 13,899 1,904 1,676 Consumer products 2,900 3,044 330 340 8,681 9,293 860 948 $ 15,897 $ 15,686 $ 2,484 $ 2,369 $ 47,173 $ 46,335 $ 7,205 $ 7,105 Aggregate revenues of our manufacturing businesses in the third quarter of 2019 were $15.9 billion, an increase of 1.3% compared to 2018 and in the first nine months were $47.2 billion, an increase of 1.8%. Pre-tax earnings in the third quarter of 2019 were $2.5 billion, an increase of 4.9% compared to 2018 and in the first nine months were $7.2 billion, an increase of 1.4%. 40 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products Revenues of the industrial products group were $7.7 billion in the third quarter and $23.3 billion in the first nine months of 2019, slight increases over revenues in each of the comparable 2018 periods. Pre-tax earnings of the group were $1.46 billion in the third quarter and $4.44 billion in the first nine months of 2019, compared to $1.45 billion and $4.48 billion in the corresponding 2018 periods. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 19.1% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 19.4% in 2018. PCC’s revenues were $2.58 billion in the third quarter and $7.80 billion in the first nine months of 2019, increases of $37 million (1.4%) and $148 million (1.9%), respectively, compared to 2018. The revenue increases reflected increased sales in aerospace markets, partly offset by lower industrial gas turbine products sales and lower sales of certain pipe products, primarily attributable to U.S tariffs. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 9% in the third quarter and 8% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 2018. The earnings increases reflected higher earnings from aerospace products and the impacts of costs incurred in 2018 related to the temporary unplanned shutdown of certain metals facilities and metal press outages and earnings from various non-recurring items in 2019, partially offset by lower earnings from industrial gas turbine business. While demand for aerospace products continues to be high, we continue to incur incremental production and other costs to meet required deliveries to customers, which have negatively affected margins and earnings. The production headwinds experienced were primarily attributable to shortages of qualified skilled labor and plant capacity. We continue to work towards addressing these issues. Lubrizol’s revenues were $1.62 billion in the third quarter and $5.01 billion in the first nine months of 2019, decreases of $92 million (5%) and $231 million (4%), respectively, as compared to 2018. The declines were primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by higher average selling prices which were necessitated by raw material cost increases in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume in the first nine months of 2019 declined 4% from 2018, reflecting reduced volumes in both the Additives and Advanced Materials product lines. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings decreased 8% in the third quarter and 5% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 2018. Earnings in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 were negatively affected by lower sales volumes, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, higher manufacturing expenses and the impact of a fire at Lubrizol’s Rouen, France manufacturing facility on September 26, 2019, partly offset by improved material margins. Marmon’s revenues were $2.13 billion in the third quarter and $6.28 billion in the first nine months of 2019, increases of $58 million (2.8%) and $140 million (2.3%), respectively, as compared to 2018. The increases reflected higher volumes in the Electrical Products, Retail Solutions and Water sectors, increased railcar repair services, higher railcar lease revenues in the third quarter, and the effects of business acquisitions. These increases were partly offset by lower distribution volumes in the Metals Services sector, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and lower metals prices in the Electrical Products and Plumbing & Refrigeration sectors. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in the third quarter of 2019 increased $12 million (3.5%), while earnings in first nine months of 2019 decreased $50 million (5%), as compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings in the first nine months of 2018 included a gain of $44 million realized on the divestiture in the Food & Beverage sector. Excluding the divestiture gain, pre-tax earnings as a percentage of sales were 15.6% in the first nine months of 2019 as compared to 16.0% in 2018. In the first nine months of 2019, we experienced lower earnings attributable to lower rail tank car leasing rates coupled with higher rail tank car maintenance expenses in the Rail Products & Leasing sector and declines in the Metals Services and Industrial Products sectors, somewhat offset by earnings increases in the Retail Solutions, Water Technologies and Crane Services sectors and from business acquisitions. IMC’s revenues in the third quarter increased 2% over 2018, and were relatively unchanged in the first nine months of 2019 as compared to the corresponding 2018 period, reflecting increased revenues from recent business acquisitions, offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar and the effects of the U.S./China trade disputes. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 11% in the first nine months of 2019 versus 2018, attributable to increased raw material costs, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, changes in business mix and the effects of the U.S./China trade disputes. CTB’s revenues decreased 8% in the third quarter of 2019 and were relatively unchanged in the first nine months of 2019 versus the same periods in 2018. The comparative decline in third quarter revenues was primarily due to lower revenues from grain and protein equipment and the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar, partly offset by higher revenues from processing systems. CTB’s pre-tax earnings declined 3% in the third quarter and increased 17% in the first nine months of 2019 as compared to the 2018 periods. Earnings in the first nine months of 2019 benefitted from a combination of favorable changes in business mix, the moderation of cost increases of certain raw materials, better pricing efficiency and ongoing efforts to control operating expenses. 41 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products Revenues of the building products group were $5.3 billion in the third quarter and $15.2 billion in the first nine months of 2019, increases of $312 million (6.3%) and $1.3 billion (9.4%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018. Pre-tax earnings of the group were $696 million in the third quarter and $1.9 billion in the first nine months of 2019, increases of 20.0% and 13.6%, respectively, over 2018. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 12.5% and 12.1% in the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Clayton Homes revenues were approximately $1.9 billion in the third quarter and $5.3 billion in the first nine months of 2019, increases of $304 million (19%) and $993 million (23%), respectively, over the same periods in 2018. The comparative increases were primarily due to increases in home sales of $263 million (22%) in the third quarter and $890 million (28%) year-to-date, reflecting increased units sold and changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 58% in the third quarter and 105% in the first nine months of 2019 over 2018, primarily due to business acquisitions, while manufactured home unit sales at retail and wholesale were unchanged in the third quarter and 4% lower in the first nine months of 2019. Interest income from lending activities in the first nine months of 2019 increased 6.5% compared to 2018, attributable to increased originations and average outstanding loan balances. Aggregate loan balances outstanding were approximately $15.5 billion at September 30, 2019 compared to $14.4 billion as of September 30, 2018. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $272 million in the third quarter and $769 million in the first nine months of 2019, increases of $67 million (33%) and $135 million (21%), respectively, compared to 2018. The earnings increases in 2019 were attributable to home building activities, which reflected the increases in home sales and manufactured housing lending activities. Pre-tax earnings from lending and finance activities in the first nine months of 2019 increased 8%, reflecting the increases in interest income and other financial services income and decreases in insurance losses, partially offset by higher interest expense, attributable to higher average borrowings and interest rates, and by higher other operating costs. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2019, unchanged from 2018, and $9.9 billion in the first nine months of 2019, an increase of 3.4% versus 2018. Comparative third quarter revenues increased for paint, coatings, and roofing products, due primarily to increased volumes and to a lesser extent increased selling prices, while sales of flooring and brick products declined, primarily attributable to lower volumes. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were $424 million in the third quarter and $1.1 billion in the first nine months of 2019, increases of 13% and 9%, respectively, over the corresponding 2018 periods. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from a combination of increases in selling prices in certain product categories, declining raw material costs for certain commodities and operating cost control initiatives, which were partly offset by the effects of increased facilities closure costs and lower earnings from flooring products. Consumer products Consumer products revenues were $2.9 billion in the third quarter and $8.7 billion in the first nine months of 2019, decreases of $144 million (4.7%) and $612 million (6.6%), respectively, versus 2018. Revenues in the first nine months of 2019 declined at Forest River, Duracell and the apparel and footwear businesses versus 2018. Revenues of Forest River declined 11% in the third quarter and 13% in the first nine months versus 2018 due to lower unit sales. Revenues of Duracell increased 7% in the third quarter and decreased 2% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the prior year periods. Duracell’s third quarter revenue increase was primarily attributable to customers delaying orders in the second quarter, partly offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Apparel and footwear revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 declined 4% and 2%, respectively, compared to 2018. The declines reflected the product shipping delays associated with a Brooks Sports distribution center that opened in the second quarter of 2019, and lower apparel and other footwear volumes, reflecting the shift by major retailers towards private label products and smaller order sizes. Consumer products pre-tax earnings were $330 million in the third quarter and $860 million in the first nine months of 2019, decreases of $10 million (2.9%) and $88 million (9.3%), respectively, compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the first nine months were 9.9% in 2019 and 10.2% in 2018. The decline in pre-tax earnings for the first nine months of 2019 was primarily attributable to lower recreational vehicle sales at Forest River, lower gross margin rates at Duracell and the costs related to a Duracell new product launch. 42 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months Revenues Pre-tax earnings Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Service $ 3,341 $ 3,397 $ 451 $ 517 $ 10,195 $ 9,948 $ 1,425 $ 1,465 Retailing 4,037 3,833 188 184 11,670 11,404 580 572 McLane Company 12,604 12,822 50 44 37,214 37,438 220 171 $ 19,982 $ 20,052 $ 689 $ 745 $ 59,079 $ 58,790 $ 2,225 $ 2,208 Service Our service business group offers fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI), franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen) and offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), publishing newspapers and other publications (Buffalo News and the BH Media Group) and operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Service group revenues were $3.3 billion in the third quarter and $10.2 billion in the first nine months of 2019, a decrease of $56 million (1.6%) in the third quarter and an increase of $247 million (2.5%) in the first nine months as compared to 2018. Sales of TTI declined 4% in the third quarter and increased 4% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the exceptionally high sales levels in 2018. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and foreign currency, TTI’s sales in the third quarter of 2019 declined 7% compared to 2018 and increased 2% in the first nine months compared to 2018. Sales began slowing in the fourth quarter of 2018 and continued to slow through the third quarter of 2019. The declines were attributable to reduced customer demand, the effects of U.S. trade tariffs, and lower sales prices. Service group revenues in the first nine months of 2019 also reflected increases in aviation-related services (NetJets and to a lesser extent FlightSafety) and the leasing businesses, and decreases from the media businesses and Charter Brokerage, which divested a high revenue, low margin business in 2019. The increases in NetJets revenues were primarily due to increases in the number of aircraft on lease and increased flight hours. Pre-tax earnings of the service group were $451 million in the third quarter of 2019, a decrease of $66 million (12.8%) compared to 2018, and $1.4 billion in the first nine months, a decrease of $40 million (2.7%) compared to the first nine months of 2018. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 14.0% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 14.7% in 2018. The comparative declines in earnings in the third quarter of 2019 were primarily due to lower earnings from TTI, partly offset by higher earnings from NetJets and FlightSafety. TTI’s earnings declines in 2019 reflected lower gross margin rates. Earnings from NetJets increased in 2019, primarily attributable to increased revenues and improved operating margins. 43 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”), which consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Other retailing businesses include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. Other retailing businesses also include three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories. Retailing group revenues were $4.0 billion in the third quarter and $11.7 billion in the first nine months of 2019, increases of $204 million (5.3%) and $266 million (2.3%), respectively, compared to 2018. BHA’s revenues, which represented approximately 65% of our year-to-date retailing revenues, increased 8% in the third quarter and 4% in the first nine months of 2019, as compared to 2018. BHA experienced revenue increases in the third quarter of 2019 in all significant product categories, including a 6% increase in new auto sales. For the first nine months of 2019, BHA’s revenue increase reflected an increase in pre-owned vehicle sales, while new auto sales were relatively unchanged compared to 2018. BHA’s revenues also reflected increases in vehicle repair work and finance and service contract activities. Home furnishings group revenues, which represented about 20% of the aggregate retailing group revenues, were relatively unchanged in the third quarter and declined 2% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. Sales in 2019 were relatively unchanged or lower in each of our home furnishings operations. Retail group pre-tax earnings were $188 million in the third quarter and $580 million in the first nine months of 2019, increases of 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively, over the comparable 2018 periods. Comparative pre-tax earnings of BHA increased 24% in the third quarter and 25% in the first nine months of 2019, primarily due to the increases in vehicle sales and from earnings from finance and service contract activities, partly offset by higher floorplan interest expense. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings in the first nine months of 2019 declined 19% versus 2018, reflecting the decline in revenues and generally higher operating expenses. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprise approximately two-thirds of McLane’s consolidated sales with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues were $12.6 billion in the third quarter and $37.2 billion in the first nine months of 2019, declines of 1.7% and 0.6% compared to the corresponding 2018 periods. Revenues in the first nine months of 2019 decreased 3% in the grocery business and increased 4% in the foodservice business compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings increased $6 million (14%) in the third quarter and $49 million (29%) in the first nine months of 2019 as compared to 2018. Results in 2019 reflected a slight increase in average gross margins and changes in business mix, partly offset by increased operating expenses, which were primarily employee-related. McLane continues to operate in an intensely competitive business environment, which is negatively affecting its current operating results. We expect these operating conditions will continue over the remainder of 2019. 44 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains/losses follows (dollars in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 Investment gains (losses) $ 10,692 $ 14,569 $ 40,079 $ 12,750 Derivative gains (losses) 234 137 1,217 303 Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 10,926 14,706 41,296 13,053 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 2,260 3,046 8,590 2,701 Net gains (losses) $ 8,666 $ 11,660 $ 32,706 $ 10,352 Effective income tax rate 20.8 % 20.5 % 20.8 % 20.8 % Investment gains/losses Due to a new accounting pronouncement adopted as of January 1, 2018, pre-tax investment gains/losses reported in earnings include unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities. Pre-tax investment gains included net unrealized gains of approximately $10.5 billion in the third quarter and $39.5 billion in the first nine months of 2019 attributable to equity securities we held at September 30, 2019. By comparison, we recorded pre-tax investment gains of approximately $14.3 billion in the third quarter and $12.1 billion in the first nine months of 2018 with respect to equity securities we held at September 30, 2018. Prior to 2018, investment gains/losses on equity securities were recorded when securities were sold based on the cost of the disposed securities. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold in the first nine months, which is the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $2.0 billion in 2019 and $2.7 billion in 2018. While the new accounting standard does not change the effect on our consolidated shareholders’ equity or total comprehensive income, it has significantly increased the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Investment gains/losses from periodic changes in securities prices will continue to cause significant volatility in our consolidated earnings. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe that the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. Substantially all remaining contracts will expire by February 2023. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant, primarily due to the volatility of underlying equity markets. As of September 30, 2019, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was $626 million and our recorded liability at fair value was $1.2 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. Contracts with an aggregate notional value of $3 billion expired in the first nine months of 2019 and contracts with an aggregate notional value of $9 billion will expire in the fourth quarter of 2019. Pre-tax gains from equity index put option contracts were $234 million in the third quarter and $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2019 compared to pre-tax gains of $137 million in the third quarter and $303 million in the first nine months of 2018. The gains in 2019 were primarily due to higher equity index values and shorter remaining contract durations. 45 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). Third Quarter First Nine Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 Equity method earnings $ 515 $ 269 $ 812 $ 894 Acquisition accounting expenses (201 ) (199 ) (581 ) (637 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (63 ) (77 ) (209 ) (236 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes 308 56 355 216 Income tax expense adjustment — — (377 ) — Other, principally corporate investment income 276 256 694 512 Net earnings (losses) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ 835 $ 305 $ 694 $ 749 After-tax equity method earnings include Berkshire’s share of earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz, Pilot Flying J, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. As discussed in Note 5 to the accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements, financial results of Kraft Heinz for the first three quarters of 2019 were made available to us during the third quarter of 2019. Accordingly, our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2019 include our share of Kraft Heinz’s earnings for those periods. After-tax equity method earnings related to our Kraft Heinz investment were $377 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 and $163 million in the third quarter and $584 million for the first nine months of 2018. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s outstanding Euro denominated debt (€6.85 billion par) and Japanese Yen denominated debt (¥430 billion par), which was issued in September 2019, and BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt (£1.75 billion par), which was issued in June 2019. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced non-cash unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The income tax expense adjustment in the first nine months of 2019 relates to investments that we made between 2015 and 2018 in certain tax equity investment funds. Our investments in these funds aggregated approximately $340 million. In December 2018 and during the first quarter of 2019, we learned of allegations by federal authorities of fraudulent income conduct by the sponsor of these funds. As a result of our investigation into these allegations, we now believe that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefits that we recognized are not valid. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2019 was $397.6 billion, an increase of $48.9 billion since December 31, 2018. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in the first nine months of 2019 were $52.3 billion, which included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $31.7 billion, which was primarily due to increases in market prices of the equity securities we owned at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills (net of amounts payable for acquired but not yet settled purchases) of $116.3 billion, which included $85.9 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $239.2 billion. In August 2019, Berkshire paid $10 billion to acquire preferred stock and warrants of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, as discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements. Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at September 30, 2019 was $19.7 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion since December 31, 2018. In August 2019, Berkshire repaid maturing senior notes of $750 million and issued ¥430 billion of senior notes (approximately $4.0 billion) in September 2019, which has a weighted average interest rate of 0.49% and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2049. 46 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition (Continued) Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $17.5 billion at September 30, 2019, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of $10.8 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and a portion of assets held for lease by our UTLX railcar leasing business. In the first nine months of 2019, BHFC repaid $3.95 billion of maturing senior notes. BHFC issued $2.0 billion of 4.25% senior notes due in 2049 in the first quarter of 2019 and in the second quarter of 2019 issued £1.0 billion of 2.375% senior notes due in 2039 and £750 million of 2.625% senior notes due in 2059. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of these two operations in the first nine months of 2019 were $7.4 billion and we forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $24.0 billion as of September 30, 2019, an increase of approximately $764 million since December 31, 2018. In July 2019, BNSF issued $825 million of 3.55% senior unsecured debentures due in 2050. BNSF debentures of $750 million matured in October 2019. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $41.0 billion at September 30, 2019, an increase of $1.7 billion since December 31, 2018. In the first nine months of 2019, BHE and its subsidiaries issued debt aggregating $3.4 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2029 to 2050 and repaid approximately $1.7 billion of maturing term debt. The proceeds from these financings were used to repay borrowings, to fund capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes. BHE subsidiary term debt of $368 million will mature in the fourth quarter of 2019. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program was amended on July 17, 2018, permitting Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In the first nine months of 2019, Berkshire repurchased shares of Class A and B common stock for an aggregate cost of $2.8 billion. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future are not currently reflected in the financial statements, which will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. Beginning in 2019, operating lease obligations are included in the consolidated balance sheet due to the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the first nine months of 2019, Berkshire and its subsidiaries issued new term debt. Principal and interest payments associated with these new borrowings are expected as follows: 2019 – $124 million; 2020 and 2021 – $637 million; 2022 and 2023 – $637 million; and thereafter – $19.1 billion. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2019 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in the “Contractual Obligations” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 47 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2019 includes estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts of $113.4 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing loss reserve amounts, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude will result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2019 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $81.2 billion. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2018. Although we believe that the goodwill reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is not impaired, goodwill may subsequently become impaired due to changes in facts and circumstances affecting the valuation of the reporting unit. A goodwill impairment charge could have a material effect on periodic earnings. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of September 30, 2019, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. 48 Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 to which reference is made herein. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities For several years, Berkshire had a common stock repurchase program that permitted Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. On July 17, 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the program, permitting Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the third quarter of 2019 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program August 5 through August 28: Class A common stock 64 $ 300,166.13 64 * Class B common stock 2,793,092 $ 197.68 2,793,092 * September 3 through September 30: Class A common stock 149 $ 310,231.27 149 * Class B common stock 375,771 $ 206.50 375,771 * * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $20 billion.

Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2019 Note 1. General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. As described in the Annual Report, we modified certain presentations to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Presentations in these interim Consolidated Financial Statements conform to the presentations in the Annual Report. Changes to those policies due to the adoption of a new accounting standard are described in Note 2. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. In light of the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, changes in the fair values of certain derivative contract liabilities and gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements Berkshire adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842 “Leases” on January 1, 2019. Most significantly, ASC 842 requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make lease payments and an asset with respect to its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Upon the adoption of ASC 842, we recognized operating lease assets of approximately $ 6.2 billion and lease liabilities of $ 5.9 billion. We also reduced other assets by approximately $ 300 million. Consequently, our consolidated assets and liabilities increased by approximately $ 5.9 billion. We are party to contracts where we lease property from others (“lessee” contracts) and where we lease property to others (“lessor” contracts). In adopting and applying ASC 842, we elected to use practical expedients, including but not limited to, not reassessing past lease and easement accounting, not separating lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and not recording assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less. We adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 with regard to contracts in effect as of that date and elected to not restate prior period financial statements. ASC 842 did not have a material effect on our accounting for our lessor contracts or for lessee contracts classified as financing leases. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate. The lease term is generally the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage or changes in an index or interest rates. Options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment. 7 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements (Continued) On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-01 “Financial Instruments—Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” ASU 2018-02 “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” and ASC 606 “Revenues from Contracts with Customers.” Prior year financial statements were not restated. A summary of the effects of the initial adoption of ASU 2016-01, ASU 2018-02 and ASC 606 on our shareholders’ equity follows (in millions). ASU 2016-01 ASU 2018-02 ASC 606 Total Increase (decrease): Accumulated other comprehensive income $ ( 61,459 ) $ 84 $ — $ ( 61,375 ) Retained earnings 61,459 ( 84 ) ( 70 ) 61,305 Shareholders’ equity — — ( 70 ) ( 70 ) With respect to ASU 2016-01, beginning in 2018, unrealized gains and losses from the changes in the fair values of our equity securities during the period are included within investment gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of January 1, 2018, we reclassified net after-tax unrealized gains on equity securities from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. In adopting ASU 2018-02, we reclassified the stranded deferred income tax effects arising from the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that were included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of January 1, 2018 to retained earnings. In adopting ASC 606, we recorded increases to certain assets and other liabilities, with the cumulative net effect recorded to retained earnings. Prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized revenues from the sales of fractional ownership interests in aircraft over the term of the related management services agreements, as the transfers of the ownership interests were inseparable from the management services agreements. These agreements also include provisions that require us to repurchase the fractional interest at fair market value at contract termination or upon the customer’s request following the end of a minimum commitment period. ASC 606 provides that such contracts are subject to accounting guidance for lease contracts. The principal effects of this re-characterization were to increase equipment held for lease and aircraft repurchase liabilities and unearned lease revenues by approximately $ 3.5 billion. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-13 “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses,” which provides for the recognition and measurement at the reporting date of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost and for available-for-sale debt securities. Currently, credit losses are recognized and measured when such losses become probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. ASU 2016-13 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” ASU 2017-04 eliminates the requirement to determine the implied value of goodwill in measuring an impairment loss. Upon adoption of ASU 2017-04, the measurement of a goodwill impairment will represent the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value and will be limited to the carrying value of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts.” ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used to value policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs arising from the issuance of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts, with the effects of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount rate assumptions reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 8 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.

Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 325,442,152 shares of Kraft Heinz common stock representing 26.7 % of the outstanding shares. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $ 10.1 billion at June 30, 2019 and $ 14.0 billion at December 31, 2018. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $ 13.5 billion at June 30, 2019 and $ 13.8 billion at December 31, 2018. In June 2019, Kraft Heinz filed its 2018 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which reflected the restatement of financial statements of prior periods. The net effect of these restatements produced a $ 34 million reduction to the carrying value of our investment. As of August 3, 2019, Kraft Heinz’s financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2019 were not yet available to Berkshire. Accordingly, Berkshire’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 exclude its share of the earnings and other comprehensive income of Kraft Heinz for those periods. Berkshire intends to record its share of Kraft Heinz’s earnings and other comprehensive income for the first six months of 2019 during the period that such information becomes available. During the six-month period ending June 30, 2018, we recorded equity method earnings of $ 467 million. Dividends received from Kraft Heinz were $ 260 million and $ 407 million in the first six months of 2019 and 2018, respectively, which we recorded as reductions of our investment. We evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment as of June 30, 2019. Based on the available facts and information, the length of time that fair value was less than carrying value and our ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery, we concluded that recognition of an impairment loss in earnings at June 30, 2019 was not required. However, we will continue to monitor this investment and it is possible that an impairment loss in earnings will be recorded in future periods based on changes in facts and circumstances or intentions. Summarized consolidated financial information of Kraft Heinz as of December 29, 2018 and for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 follows (in millions). December 29, 2018 Assets $ 103,461 Liabilities 51,683 Second Quarter First Six Months 2018 2018 Sales $ 6,690 $ 12,994 Net earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz common shareholders $ 754 $ 1,757 10 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5. Equity method investments (Continued) Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC, d/b/a Pilot Flying J (“Pilot Flying J”), and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”). The carrying value of our investments in these entities was approximately $ 3.7 billion as of June 30, 2019 and $ 3.5 billion as of December 31, 2018. Our equity method earnings in these entities in the first six months were $ 314 million in 2019 and $ 261 million in 2018. Additional information concerning these investments follows. We own a 50 % interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50 % interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through its issuance of commercial paper, which is currently limited to $ 1.5 billion. On June 30, 2019, Berkadia’s commercial paper outstanding was $ 1.47 billion. The commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. In addition, a Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company subsidiary owns a 50 % interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint. American Electric Power owns the other 50 % interest. On October 3, 2017, we entered into an investment agreement and an equity purchase agreement whereby we acquired a 38.6 % interest in Pilot Flying J, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot Flying J is one of the largest operators of travel centers in North America, with more than 28,000 team members, 750 locations across the U.S. and Canada, and nearly $ 30 billion in annual revenues. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1 % interest in Pilot Flying J and a third party owns the remaining 11.3 % interest. We also entered into an agreement to acquire in 2023 an additional 41.4 % interest in Pilot Flying J with the Haslam family retaining a 20 % interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot Flying J in 2023. Note 6. Investment gains/losses Investment gains/losses in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 and 2018 are summarized as follows (in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 Equity securities: Unrealized investment gains (losses) on securities held at the end of the period $ 9,827 $ 5,585 $ 29,192 $ ( 2,146 ) Investment gains (losses) during the period 5 357 194 41 9,832 5,942 29,386 ( 2,105 ) Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains 7 48 12 407 Gross realized losses ( 6 ) ( 4 ) ( 16 ) ( 142 ) Other 2 4 5 21 $ 9,835 $ 5,990 $ 29,387 $ ( 1,819 ) Prior to 2018, we recognized investment gains and losses in earnings when we sold equity securities based on the difference between the proceeds from the sale and the cost of the securities and also when we recognized other-than-temporary impairment losses. Beginning in 2018, equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own. Prior to 2018, we recorded the changes in unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities in other comprehensive income. In the first six months of 2019 and 2018, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $ 4.5 billion and $ 9.0 billion, respectively, from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains/losses on equity securities sold in each period reflect the difference between proceeds from sales and the fair value of the equity security sold at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Our taxable gains on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Taxable gains in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 were $ 832 million and $ 1,350 million, respectively, and $ 629 million and $ 1,359 million, respectively, in the second quarter and first six months of 2018. 11 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7.

At June 30, 2019, approximately 98 % of the manufactured housing loan balances were evaluated collectively for impairment, with the remainder evaluated individually. As part of the evaluation process, credit quality indicators are reviewed and loans are designated as performing or non-performing. At June 30, 2019, we considered approximately 99 % of the loan balances to be performing and approximately 96 % of the loan balances to be current as to payment status. Additionally, during 2018, an insurance subsidiary entered into an agreement with Seritage Growth Properties to provide a $ 2.0 billion term loan facility, which matures on July 31, 2023 . As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the outstanding loans under the facility were approximately $ 1.6 billion. Note 8.

Leases We are party to contracts where we lease property from others. As a lessee, we primarily lease office and operating facilities, locomotives, freight cars, energy generation facilities and transmission assets. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities included in our June 30, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet were approximately $ 6.1 billion and $ 5.9 billion, respectively.

Derivative contracts We are party to derivative contracts through certain of our subsidiaries. Currently, the most significant derivative contracts consist of equity index put option contracts. The liabilities and related notional values of these contracts follows (in millions). Liabilities Notional Value June 30, 2019 $ 1,470 $ 24,524 December 31, 2018 2,452 26,759 Notional value represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming that the value of each index is zero at each contract’s expiration date. Certain of these contracts are denominated in foreign currencies. Notional amounts are based on the foreign currency exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. Pre-tax gains from equity index put option contracts were $ 213 million and $ 983 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively, and $ 372 million and $ 166 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. The equity index put option contracts are European style options written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. The remaining contracts expire between August 2019 and October 2025 . The weighted average life of unexpired contracts at June 30, 2019 was approximately 1.5 years. Contracts with notional values of $ 10.0 billion will expire over the remainder of 2019. Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike price at the expiration date. We received aggregate premiums of $ 3.8 billion on the contract inception dates with respect to unexpired contracts at June 30, 2019 and we have no counterparty credit risk. The aggregate intrinsic value (the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date) was $ 791 million at June 30, 2019 and $ 1,653 million at December 31, 2018. These contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the expiration dates and the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses on these contracts will not be determined until the contract expiration dates. A limited number of our equity index put option contracts contain collateral posting requirements with respect to changes in the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts and/or a downgrade of Berkshire’s credit ratings. As of June 30, 2019, we did not have any collateral posting requirements. If Berkshire’s credit ratings (currently AA from Standard & Poor’s and Aa2 from Moody’s) are downgraded below either A- by Standard & Poor’s or A3 by Moody’s, collateral of up to $ 1.1 billion could be required to be posted. Our regulated utility subsidiaries are exposed to variations in the prices of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity purchased and sold and natural gas supplied for customers. We may use forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options to manage a portion of these price risks. Most of the net derivative contract assets or liabilities of our regulated utilities are probable of recovery through rates and are offset by regulatory liabilities or assets. Derivative contract assets are included in other assets and were $ 150 million as of June 30, 2019 and $ 172 million as of December 31, 2018. Derivative contract liabilities are included in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities and were $ 120 million as of June 30, 2019 and $ 111 million as of December 31, 2018. Note 15. Supplemental cash flow information A summary of supplemental cash flow information is presented in the following table (in millions). First Six Months 2019 2018 Cash paid during the period for: Income taxes $ 1,199 $ 2,358 Interest: Insurance and other 540 646 Railroad, utilities and energy 1,370 1,402 Non-cash investing and financing activities: Liabilities assumed in connection with business acquisitions 94 76 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 361 — 16 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under short-duration property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences on or before the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. Reconciliations of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 17), for each of the six months ending June 30, 2019 and 2018 follow (in millions). 2019 2018 Balances – beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 68,458 $ 61,122 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses ( 3,060 ) ( 3,201 ) Net liabilities 65,398 57,921 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events 20,127 18,905 Prior accident years’ events 71 ( 1,054 ) Total incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 20,198 17,851 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events ( 7,724 ) ( 7,332 ) Prior accident years’ events ( 10,243 ) ( 8,581 ) Total payments ( 17,967 ) ( 15,913 ) Foreign currency translation adjustment 3 ( 111 ) Balances – June 30: Net liabilities 67,632 59,748 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 3,149 2,989 Gross liabilities $ 70,781 $ 62,737 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months of 2019 included a net increase of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $ 71 million compared to a net decrease of $ 1,054 million in the first six months of 2018. Increases and decreases in estimated ultimate liabilities produce corresponding decreases and increases to pre-tax earnings. Such amounts as percentages of net liabilities at the beginning of the year were 0.1 % in 2019 and 1.8 % in 2018. In the first six months of 2019, we lowered estimated ultimate liabilities of primary insurance for prior years’ events by $ 198 million, compared to $ 768 million in 2018. Reductions of estimated liabilities in the first six months of 2019 were less than the first six months of 2018 for private passenger automobile and medical malpractice insurance. In addition, we increased estimated liabilities in the first six months of 2019 for legacy casualty exposures and other commercial insurance business. In the first six months of 2019, we increased estimated ultimate property and casualty reinsurance liabilities for prior years’ events by $ 269 million, compared to a decrease of $ 286 million in the first six months of 2018. The increases in prior years’ incurred losses in 2019 derived primarily from casualty claims, and to a lesser degree property claims. 17 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 17. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, if applicable, once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the six months ending June 30, 2019 and 2018 follows (in millions). 2019 2018 Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Deferred charges reinsurance assumed Balances – beginning of year: $ 41,834 $ ( 14,104 ) $ 42,937 $ ( 15,278 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses Current year contracts 175 ( 82 ) — — Prior years’ contracts — 552 ( 35 ) 548 Total 175 470 ( 35 ) 548 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( 460 ) — ( 787 ) — Balances – June 30: $ 41,549 $ ( 13,634 ) $ 42,115 $ ( 14,730 ) Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges $ 645 $ 513 In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months related to contracts written in prior years were $ 552 million in 2019 and $ 513 million in 2018. Such losses reflected the periodic amortization of deferred charge assets and the effects of changes in the timing and amount of ultimate claim liabilities. In 2017, National Indemnity Company (“NICO”) entered into a contract with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”). Our estimated ultimate claim liabilities with respect to the AIG contract at both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were $ 18.2 billion. Deferred charge assets related to the AIG contract were approximately $ 6.6 billion at June 30, 2019 and $ 6.9 billion at December 31, 2018. Note 18. Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of June 30, 2019. Weighted Average Interest Rate June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Insurance and other: Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) The carrying value of Berkshire’s Euro denominated senior notes (€ 6.85 billion par) reflects the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate resulted in pre-tax gains of $ 64 million in the first six months of 2019 and $ 219 million in the first six months of 2018. The carrying values of the Euro denominated senior notes reflected corresponding decreases with respect to these gains. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. In January 2019, BHFC issued $ 2.0 billion of 4.25 % senior notes due in 2049 and repaid $ 2.7 billion of maturing notes. In June 2019, BHFC also issued £ 1.75 billion of senior notes consisting of £ 1.0 billion 2.375 % senior notes due in 2039 and £ 750 million 2.625 % senior notes due in 2059 . The carrying value of BHFC’s GBP borrowings reflect the GBP/U.S. Dollar exchange rate, with the effects of the changes recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In addition to BHFC borrowings, at June 30, 2019, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $ 1.5 billion of other subsidiary borrowings. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. Weighted Average Interest Rate June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2020 - 2049 4.6 % $ 8,579 $ 8,577 Subsidiary and other debt due 2019 - 2064 4.5 % 29,517 28,196 Short-term borrowings 3.4 % 2,594 2,516 Burlington Northern Santa Fe and subsidiaries due 2019 - 2097 4.7 % 23,192 23,226 $ 63,882 $ 62,515 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. During the first six months of 2019, BHE and its subsidiaries issued approximately $ 3.4 billion of long-term debt. The debt issued in 2019 has maturity dates ranging from 2029 to 2050 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.9 %. Proceeds from these debt issuances were used to repay debt, to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In July 2019, BNSF issued $ 825 million of 3.55 % senior unsecured debentures due in 2050 . As of June 30, 2019, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2019, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $ 7.5 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included approximately $ 5.7 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 19 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19. Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, receivables and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of their fair values.

Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 follow (in millions). Gains (losses) included in: Balance – beginning of year Earnings Other comprehensive income Regulatory assets and liabilities Acquisitions, dispositions and settlements Transfers into/out of Level 3 Balance – June 30 Net derivative contract assets (liabilities): 2019 $ ( 2,343 ) $ 1,134 $ ( 1 ) $ ( 23 ) $ ( 128 ) $ — $ ( 1,361 ) 2018 ( 2,069 ) 256 — ( 14 ) ( 79 ) — ( 1,906 ) Quantitative information as of June 30, 2019, with respect to assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follows (in millions). Fair Value Principal Valuation Techniques Unobservable Inputs Weighted Average Derivative contract liabilities – Equity index put options $ 1,470 Option pricing model Volatility 16 % Our equity index put option contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts and certain of the contracts have relatively long durations. For these and other reasons, we classified these contracts as Level 3 measurements. The methods we use to value these contracts are those that we believe market participants would use in determining exchange prices with respect to our contracts. We value equity index put option contracts based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to this model include index price, contract duration and dividend and interest rate inputs (including a Berkshire non-performance input) which are observable. However, we believe that the valuation of long-duration options using any model is inherently subjective and, given the lack of observable transactions and prices, acceptable values may be subject to wide ranges. Volatility inputs represent our expectations, which consider the remaining duration of each contract and assume that the contracts will remain outstanding until the expiration dates. Increases or decreases in the volatility inputs will produce increases or decreases in the fair values of the liabilities. 21 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 20. Common stock Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the first six months of 2019 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Class A, $ 5 Par Value ( 1,650,000 shares authorized) Class B, $ 0.0033 Par Value ( 3,225,000,000 shares authorized) Issued Treasury Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding Balance December 31, 2018 742,213 ( 12,897 ) 729,316 1,373,558,983 ( 6,138,909 ) 1,367,420,074 Conversions of Class A common stock to Class B common stock and exercises of replacement stock options ( 5,919 ) — ( 5,919 ) 9,144,369 — 9,144,369 Treasury stock acquired — ( 1,539 ) ( 1,539 ) — ( 8,285,970 ) ( 8,285,970 ) Balance at June 30, 2019 736,294 ( 14,436 ) 721,858 1,382,703,352 ( 14,424,879 ) 1,368,278,473 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,634,044 shares outstanding as of June 30, 2019 and 1,640,929 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding. For several years, Berkshire had a common stock repurchase program, which permitted Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. On July 17, 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the program, permitting Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $ 20 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note 21. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 were 20.2 % and 20.9 %, respectively, and 20.0 % and 18.9 % in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings and underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. In the first quarter of 2019, we recorded income tax expense of $ 377 million for uncertain tax positions related to investments in certain tax equity investment funds that generated income tax benefits from 2015 through 2018. We now believe that it is more likely than not those income tax benefits are not valid. 22 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 22.

Contingencies and Commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise from other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. On April 30, 2019, Berkshire committed to invest a total of $ 10 billion in connection with Occidental Petroleum Corporation’s (“Occidental”) proposal to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (“Anadarko”). The acquisition transaction between Occidental and Anadarko is subject to approval by Anadarko shareholders, who are scheduled to vote on the acquisition on August 8, 2019. If approved by Anadarko shareholders, we expect the acquisition and our investment will be completed shortly thereafter. If completed, Berkshire’s investment will include newly issued Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $ 10 billion, together with warrants to purchase up to 80 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $ 62.50 per share. The preferred stock will accrue dividends at 8 % per annum and will be redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing on the tenth anniversary of issuance at a redemption price equal to 105 % of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, or mandatorily under certain specified capital return events. Dividends will be paid in cash or, at Occidental’s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants issued with the preferred stock may be exercised in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. 23 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 24. Revenues from contracts with customers On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 “Revenues from Contracts with Customers.” Under ASC 606, revenues are recognized when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 and 2018 (in millions). Other revenues included in consolidated revenues were primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues which are not within the scope of ASC 606.

Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. The accompanying business segment information for the 2018 periods reflects certain reclassifications to conform to presentations as of December 31, 2018. Specifically, business units that previously were reported as the finance and financial products segment in the 2018 periods were reclassified to manufacturing (Clayton Homes and UTLX), services and retailing (CORT and XTRA leasing) and corporate and other (principally investment income). Revenues and earnings before income taxes by segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions).

We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $353 million in the second quarter and $742 million in the first six months of 2019. In 2019, insurance underwriting included gains from primary insurance and losses from reinsurance. Earnings from insurance underwriting in 2019 included lower gains from reductions of claim liability estimates for prior years’ property/casualty loss events than in 2018. After-tax earnings from insurance investments increased 19.6% in the second quarter and 20.8% in the first six months of 2019 over the same periods in 2018. These increases reflected higher average short-term interest rates and increased dividend income. After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 2.2% in the second quarter and 5.6% in the first six months of 2019 compared to 2018. Earnings in 2019 were negatively affected by persistent flooding conditions in the first half and severe winter weather in the first quarter. These conditions contributed to lower freight volumes and higher operating costs. Earnings in 2019 benefited from higher rates per car/unit, a curtailment gain related to an amendment to defined benefit retirement plans and ongoing operating cost control initiatives. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 4.5% in the second quarter and 3.9% in the first six months of 2019 compared to the corresponding 2018 periods. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses were essentially unchanged in the second quarter and increased 1.6% in the first six months over the same periods in 2018. Operating results of our underlying business operations in 2019 were mixed, with several of these businesses experiencing lower earnings in 2019 attributable to a variety of factors. After-tax investment and derivative gains were $7.9 billion in the second quarter and $24.0 billion in the first six months of 2019, compared to an after-tax gain of $5.1 billion in the second quarter and an after-tax loss of $1.3 billion in the first six months of 2018. Investment and derivative gains/losses in 2019 included significant unrealized gains from market price changes on our holdings of equity securities. After-tax unrealized gains on equity securities were approximately $7.1 billion in the second quarter and $22.2 billion in the first six months of 2019. After-tax investment gains in 2019 also included after-tax realized gains on sales of equity and fixed maturity securities of $662 million in the second quarter and $1,054 million in the first six months. In 2018, investments in equity securities produced after-tax unrealized gains of $4.3 billion in the second quarter and an after-tax loss of approximately $2.7 billion in the first six months due to changes in market prices. After-tax realized gains on sales of equity and fixed maturity securities in 2018 were $512 million in the second quarter and $1.3 billion in the first six months. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or settlements or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 27 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as a component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held philosophy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods. Accordingly, we believe that such gains and losses are not necessarily meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance operations. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider pre-tax losses in excess of $100 million from a current year event as significant. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were $112.3 billion as of June 30, 2019. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Premiums written and earned in the second quarter of 2019 increased 5.7% and 7.1%, respectively, and in the first six months of 2019 increased 6.1% and 8.0%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018. The increases reflected voluntary auto policies-in-force growth of 4.5% and increased premiums per auto policy of approximately 1.7% over the past twelve months. The increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force primarily resulted from an increase in new business sales of 8.6%. The increase in premiums per policy was attributable to rate increases, coverage changes and changes in state and risk mix. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 570,000 during the first six months of 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the second quarter of 2019 increased 11.9% to $7.3 billion and in the first six months of 2019 increased 10.0% to $13.8 billion. GEICO’s ratios of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 were 82.0% and 79.1%, respectively, increases of 3.5 percentage points over the second quarter and 1.4 percentage points over the first six months of 2018. GEICO reduced ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events by $54 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to $430 million in the first six months of 2018, which produced corresponding pre-tax underwriting gains. The comparative reduction in gains in the first six months pertained to both physical damage and liability claims. Claims frequencies in the first six months of 2019 for property damage and collision coverages and personal injury protection coverage were down (two to four percent range) compared to 2018 and were flat for bodily injury coverage. Average claims severities in the first six months of 2019 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (six to eight percent range). Underwriting expenses in the first six months of 2019 were $2.5 billion, an increase of $227 million (10.0%) over 2018. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in the first six months of 2019 was 14.3%, an increase of 0.3 percentage points compared to 2018. The underwriting expense increase was primarily attributable to increases in advertising expenses, insurance premium taxes and employee-related costs, which reflected wage and staffing increases. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and General Re Life Corporation (collectively, “General Re”). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN. With the exception of our retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity product lines, we strive to generate pre-tax underwriting profits. Time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity premiums due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from these products through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Premiums earned in the second quarter were relatively unchanged and in the first six months of 2019 increased $301 million (7.0%), versus 2018. The increase in year-to-date premiums earned was primarily attributable to new business, net of non-renewals, and increased participations for renewal business. Premiums earned in the first six months included $861 million in 2019 and $910 million in 2018 from a 10-year, 20% quota-share contract entered into by NICO with Insurance Australia Group Limited, which expires in 2025. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 increased $45 million (3.2%) and $428 million (15.3%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months of 2019 included a net increase in estimated ultimate claim liabilities attributable to prior years’ loss events of approximately $269 million compared to a net decrease of $286 million in 2018. Such increases and decreases were approximately 1% of the related net unpaid claim liabilities as of the beginning of the applicable year. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months of 2019 also reflected an overall 7.4 percentage point decline in the loss ratio attributable to the current accident year as compared to 2018. There were no significant catastrophe loss events affecting our reinsurance operations during the first six months of 2019 or 2018. Retroactive reinsurance There were no significant retroactive reinsurance contracts written in the first six months of 2019 or 2018. Pre-tax underwriting losses in 2019 and 2018 derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amount of future claim payments, as well as from foreign currency gains and losses arising from the periodic re-measurement of liabilities related to contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies. Underwriting results included pre-tax gains of $41 million in the second quarter and pre-tax losses of $11 million in the first six months of 2019 associated with the re-measurement of such liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency re-measurement gains in 2018 were $124 million in the second quarter and $64 million in the first six months. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses in the second quarter and first six months were $279 million and $550 million, respectively, in 2019 compared to $271 million and $522 million, respectively, in 2018. Deferred charge amortization in the first six months included $316 million in 2019 and $299 million in 2018 related to an aggregate excess-of-loss retroactive reinsurance agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $41.5 billion at June 30, 2019 and $41.8 billion at December 31, 2018. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were $13.6 billion at June 30, 2019 and $14.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Deferred charge assets will be charged to pre-tax earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization. 30 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Life/health A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 Amount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Premiums written $ 1,092 $ 1,330 $ 2,119 $ 2,567 Premiums earned $ 1,086 100.0 $ 1,314 100.0 $ 2,113 100.0 $ 2,548 100.0 Life and health insurance benefits 863 79.5 1,024 77.9 1,461 69.1 1,960 76.9 Underwriting expenses 212 19.5 170 13.0 361 17.1 372 14.6 Total benefits and expenses 1,075 99.0 1,194 90.9 1,822 86.2 2,332 91.5 Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) $ 11 $ 120 $ 291 $ 216 Life/health premiums earned were $1.1 billion in the second quarter and $2.1 billion in first six months of 2019, decreases of $228 million (17.4%) and $435 million (17.1%), respectively, compared to corresponding 2018 periods. The decreases were primarily attributable to the effects of an amendment to a reinsurance contract in the first quarter of 2019, partially offset by volume growth in the Asia life markets. In the first quarter of 2019, BHLN amended a yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract with a major U.S. reinsurer. The amendment effectively eliminates BHLN’s future exposures under the contract. BHLN recorded a reduction in earned premiums on this contract of $49 million in the first six months of 2019, largely attributable to the contract amendment. Premiums earned from this contract in the first six months of 2018 were $442 million and approximately $1.0 billion for the year ending December 31, 2018. The life/health business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $11 million in the second quarter and $291 million in the first six months of 2019. Underwriting results in the first six months of 2019 included a one-time pre-tax gain of approximately $160 million attributable to the BHLN contract amendment, which resulted in reductions of benefits incurred and premiums earned. Pre-tax life/health underwriting results also included gains from the run-off of variable annuity contracts of $12 million in the second quarter and $101 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to $55 million in the second quarter and $100 million in the first six months of 2018. Underwriting results from this business reflect changes in estimated liabilities for guaranteed benefits, which result from changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. In 2019, pre-tax life/health underwriting results also reflected an increase in the second quarter in disability benefit liabilities in Australia, attributable to higher claims experience and changes to various underlying assumptions, an increase in U.S. individual life claims incurred due to higher than expected severity, and higher losses from the run-off of U.S. long-term care business. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in the first six months of 2019 were $423 million, a decrease of $159 million (27.3%) compared to 2018. Periodic payment business is price sensitive. The volumes written can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, and the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include the impact of mortality and interest rate changes, as well as re-measurement gains and losses related to foreign currency denominated liabilities of certain contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results in 2019 included pre-tax re-measurement gains of $37 million in the second quarter and $9 million in the first six months due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Re-measurement gains were $106 million in the second quarter and $36 million in the first six months of 2018. Before foreign currency re-measurement gains, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $112 million in the second quarter and $254 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to losses of $120 million in the second quarter and $223 million in the first six months of 2018. Discounted annuity liabilities were $12.9 billion at June 30, 2019 and $12.5 billion at December 31, 2018, reflecting a weighted average discount rate of approximately 4.1%. 31 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), and National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Applied Underwriters, Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company, acquired October 1, 2018. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

The comparative year-to-date increase was primarily attributable to BH Specialty (23.8%) and GUARD (23.6%), while aggregate premiums written in 2019 by other BH Primary operations were relatively unchanged from 2018. The increases in premiums earned in 2019 reflected volume increases over the past year, as well as the impact of the MLMIC acquisition. BH Primary produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $137 million in the first six months of 2019 and $333 million in the first six months of 2018. BH Primary’s aggregate loss ratios for the first six months were 70.7% in 2019 and 63.7% in 2018. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the first six months included reductions for prior years’ loss events of $144 million in 2019 and $338 million in 2018. The net gains from the reductions of prior accident years’ liabilities in 2019 were generally lower compared to 2018 across the various BH Primary operations, due in part to additional estimated claim liabilities recorded in the first quarter of 2019 for legacy casualty exposures. BH Primary units write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to higher severity and longer claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher than expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Insurance—Investment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Insurance—Investment Income (Continued) Interest and other investment income in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 increased $178 million (44.6%) and $239 million (28.1%), respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2018. The comparative increases were primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term investments and interest from a term loan with Seritage Growth Properties. For the first six months, the increase in interest income was partially offset by lower income earned from limited partnership investments. Dividend income in 2019 increased $79 million (8.0%) in the second quarter and $298 million (17.1%) in the first six months compared to the corresponding 2018 periods. The increases in dividend income were attributable to an overall increase in investment levels over the past year and higher dividend rates. We continue to hold large cash, cash equivalent and U.S. Treasury Bills balances. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float was approximately $125 billion at June 30, 2019 and $123 billion at December 31, 2018. Our average cost of float was negative in the first six months of 2019 as our underwriting operations generated pre-tax earnings of $943 million.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 Revenues $ 5,893 $ 5,878 $ 11,655 $ 11,502 Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 1,334 1,328 2,734 2,643 Fuel 775 830 1,486 1,597 Purchased services 687 714 1,400 1,406 Depreciation and amortization 595 575 1,186 1,146 Equipment rents, materials and other 462 520 876 1,030 Total operating expenses 3,853 3,967 7,682 7,822 Interest expense 267 256 535 512 4,120 4,223 8,217 8,334 Pre-tax earnings 1,773 1,655 3,438 3,168 Income taxes 435 346 847 714 Net earnings $ 1,338 $ 1,309 $ 2,591 $ 2,454 Effective income tax rate 24.5 % 20.9 % 24.6 % 22.5 % BNSF’s revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 were $5.9 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively, representing increases of $15 million (0.3%) and $153 million (1.3%) versus the corresponding periods in 2018. During the first six months of 2019, revenues reflected a 6.3% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit, driven by increased rates per car/unit. Aggregate year-to-date volumes were 5.0 million cars, representing a decrease of 4.5% from volumes in the first half of 2018. Pre-tax earnings were $1.8 billion and $3.4 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively, increases of 7.1% and 8.5%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2018. BNSF experienced severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network in the first half of 2019, which negatively affected revenues, expenses and service levels. BNSF’s earnings in the first six months of 2019 also included a revenue increase related to the favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing and a reduction to expense for a curtailment gain arising from an amendment to the defined benefit retirement plans in the first quarter, as well as lower operating expenses attributable to lower volume and cost control initiatives. Revenues from consumer products were $1.9 billion in the second quarter and $3.9 billion in the first six months of 2019, representing a decrease of 3.8% in the second quarter and an increase of 1.7% in the first six months from the corresponding periods in 2018. The changes reflect higher average revenue per car/unit for both periods offset by volume decreases of 6.3% in the second quarter and 6.0% in the first six months. The volume decreases were driven by reduced consumer demand and higher available truck capacity, as well as from lower international intermodal market share and decreased imports. Revenues from industrial products were $1.6 billion in the second quarter and $3.0 billion for the first six months of 2019, increases of 6.4% and 7.4%, respectively, from comparable 2018 periods. The increases were attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit on flat volume in the second quarter and a 0.6% volume increase in the first six months of 2019. Volume changes were primarily due to strength in the energy sector, which drove higher demand for petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas, offset by lower sand volumes and reduced car loadings due to the challenging weather conditions in 2019. Revenues from agricultural products in 2019 increased 3.3% in the second quarter to $1.2 billion and were unchanged in the first six months at $2.3 billion, when compared to the same periods in 2018. The comparative results reflected higher revenue per car/unit, offset by volume decreases of 4.2% in the second quarter and 5.7% in the first six months. Volumes decreased due to export competition from non-U.S. sources, trade policy, and the challenging weather conditions in 2019. Revenues from coal in 2019 decreased 3.1% in the second quarter to $883 million and 5.8% in the first six months to $1.8 billion compared to 2018. The decreases reflected lower average revenue per car/unit, a volume increase of 1.1% in the second quarter, and a volume decrease of 4.8% in the first six months. Volumes in the first half of 2019 were impacted by the weather conditions, and volumes in the second quarter of 2019 increased due to customer demand. 34 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued) Total operating expenses in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 were $3.9 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively, decreases of $114 million (2.9%) and $140 million (1.8%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018. Our ratio of operating expenses to revenues decreased 2.1 percentage points to 65.4% in the second quarter and 2.1 percentage points to 65.9% in the first six months of 2019 versus the corresponding prior year periods. BNSF’s expenses reflected lower volume-related costs, the effects of several cost control initiatives, and a retirement plan curtailment gain, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the adverse weather conditions. Compensation and benefits expense increased $6 million (0.5%) for the second quarter and $91 million (3.4%) for the first six months of 2019 . The increases were primarily due to wage inflation and higher employee counts. F uel expenses decreased $55 million (6.6%) for the second quarter and $111 million (7.0%) for the first six months of 2019, primarily due to lower average fuel prices and lower volumes. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $58 million (11.2%) for the second quarter and $154 million (15.0%) for the first six months compared to 2018. The decrease in the first six months was principally driven by a $120 million curtailment gain from the amendment to the company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans. BNSF’s effective income tax rate was 24.5% and 24.6% for the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively, as compared to 20.9% and 22.5%, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2018. The effective income tax rates in 2018 included the impact of various state income tax rate reductions enacted during the second quarter. Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) We currently own 90.9% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. In addition, BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. The legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) was enacted in December 2017, which reduced the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In 2018, BHE’s regulated subsidiaries began passing the benefits of lower income tax expense attributable to the TCJA to customers through various regulatory mechanisms, including lower rates, higher depreciation and reductions to rate base. Revenues and earnings of BHE are summarized below (dollars in millions).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) PacifiCorp PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. Revenues in the second quarter of 2019 were $1.2 billion, relatively unchanged from 2018, and were $2.5 billion in the first six months, an increase of 3% over the first six months of 2018. Retail revenues in the first six months of 2019 increased $83 million compared to 2018, reflecting a 1.4% increase in volumes and higher average rates ($48 million) from lower net tax deferrals related to the TCJA (largely offset by higher income tax expense) and business mix changes. Wholesale and other revenues in the first six months of 2019 decreased $34 million due to lower volumes. Pre-tax earnings were $206 million in the second quarter of 2019, a decline of $6 million (3%) from 2018, and were $428 million in the first six months, an increase of $43 million (11%) as compared to 2018. Utility margin (operating revenues less cost of fuel and energy) was $783 million in the second quarter of 2019, a decrease of 1% versus 2018, and $1,577 million in the first six months, an increase of 2% compared to 2018. PacifiCorp’s after-tax earnings were $168 million in the second quarter of 2019, a decrease of $17 million (9%) compared to 2018, and were $348 million in the first six months of 2019, an increase of $15 million (5%) over 2018. The changes reflected the changes in utility margin, higher depreciation and lower net interest and finance expenses. MidAmerican Energy Company MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. Revenues were $684 million in the second quarter of 2019, a decrease of 6% compared to 2018, and were $1,556 million in the first six months, an increase of 4% versus 2018. Electric operating revenues decreased $51 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus 2018. The decrease was attributable to lower retail revenues ($38 million), reflecting a decrease in aggregate volumes of 3.7% and lower average rates from sales mix and lower recoveries through bill riders, and decreased wholesale and other revenue ($13 million). For the second quarter of 2019, natural gas revenues decreased $16 million compared to 2018, primarily due to decreased volumes. Electric operating revenues increased $22 million in the first six months of 2019 versus 2018. The increase was attributable to higher retail revenues ($17 million), reflecting an increase in aggregate volumes of 0.5% and higher average rates from higher recoveries through bill riders, substantially offset by sales mix. Pre-tax earnings were $53 million in the second quarter of 2019, a decline of $3 million (5%) versus 2018, and were $137 million in the first six months, an increase of $41 million (43%) compared to 2018. Electric utility margin in the second quarter of 2019 decreased $24 million (5%) to $447 million and increased $43 million (5%) in the first six months to $875 million. MEC’s after-tax earnings are greater than its pre-tax earnings due to the significant production tax credits related to its wind-powered generating facilities. MEC’s after-tax earnings were $153 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $343 million in the first six months, increases of $50 million (49%) and $137 million (67%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018, reflecting increases in tax credits recognized. NV Energy NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. Revenues were $731 million in the second quarter and $1,359 million in the first six months of 2019, decreases of 4% and 2%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018. Electric operating revenues decreased $31 million in the second quarter and $29 million in the first six months versus 2018. The decreases in electric revenues were attributable to lower retail revenue of $35 million in the second quarter and $45 million in the first six months, reflecting lower customer volumes of 3.9% in the second quarter and lower rates resulting from decreased pass-through cost adjustments and reductions related to the TCJA that were effective April 1, 2018, partially offset by increased wholesale and other revenue of $4 million in the second quarter and $16 million year-to-date compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings increased $9 million (9%) in the second quarter and $5 million (4%) in the first six months of 2019 as compared to 2018. Electric utility margin was $394 million in the second quarter and $716 million in the first six months of 2019, decreases of $19 million and $26 million, respectively, compared to 2018, primarily due to lower retail operating revenues. However, the declines in electric utility margin in 2019 were more than offset by lower operating expenses and lower net interest and finance expenses. NV Energy’s after-tax earnings were $81 million (5% increase) in the second quarter and $110 million (unchanged) in the first six months of 2019 versus the corresponding 2018 periods. 36 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued) Northern Powergrid Revenues decreased $4 million in the second quarter and $16 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar in 2019, partially offset by higher distribution and smart meter revenues. Pre-tax earnings increased $30 million in the second quarter and $20 million in the first six months of 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to pension settlement losses incurred in 2018, partly offset by lower revenues. Natural gas pipelines Revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 declined $23 million (10%) and $26 million (4%), respectively, compared to 2018. The declines were primarily due to lower gas sales volumes related to system balancing activities at Northern Natural Gas (largely offset in cost of sales), partially offset by higher transportation revenues of $16 million in the second quarter and $27 million in the first six months. Pre-tax earnings were $63 million in the second quarter and $301 million in the first six months of 2019, increases of $10 million (19%) and $29 million (11%), respectively, compared to 2018. The increases were primarily due to the increases in transportation revenues and favorable margins from system rebalancing activities, partly offset by a comparative increase in operations and maintenance expenses. Other energy businesses Other energy revenues declined $25 million (4%) in the second quarter and $61 million (6%) in the first six months of 2019 as compared to the same periods in 2018. The declines included comparative year-to-date decreases of 9% from renewable energy and 4% at AltaLink, L.P., mainly due to the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar in 2019. Pre-tax earnings decreased $36 million in the second quarter and $63 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. Pre-tax losses from tax equity renewable energy investments in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 increased $14 million and $35 million, respectively, over 2018, largely attributable to new investments. The pre-tax losses from these investments are substantially offset by income tax benefits. Results in 2019 also included lower operating earnings from renewable energy, AltaLink and the non-regulated service business, attributable to higher operating and depreciation expenses from renewable energy, the stronger U.S. Dollar at AltaLink, L.P., and lower non-regulated service business margins. After-tax earnings from other energy activities were $147 million in the second quarter and $238 million in the first six months of 2019, decreases of $10 million and $16 million, respectively, versus 2018. Real estate brokerage Revenues increased 4% in both the second quarter and the first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The increases were attributable to recent business acquisitions and higher mortgage revenues, partly offset by an 8% year-to-date decrease in closed units at existing brokerage businesses. Pre-tax earnings increased 7% in the second quarter and decreased 6% in the first six months of 2019 compared to 2018. The year-to-date decrease was primarily due to lower earnings at existing brokerage businesses and increased interest expense, which more than offset the increase in mortgage net revenues and contributions from acquired businesses. Corporate interest Corporate interest includes interest on unsecured debt issued by the BHE holding company. Corporate interest in the first six months of 2019 increased 4% compared to 2018, primarily due to higher average borrowings. Income taxes BHE’s effective income tax rates for the first six months of 2019 and 2018 were approximately (18.5%) and (21.4%), respectively. BHE’s effective income tax rates regularly reflect significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation placed in service by our domestic regulated utilities and other energy businesses. The effective tax rate in the first six months of 2019 increased primarily due to benefits recognized in 2018 related to foreign earnings and the accrued repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the TCJA, partially offset by an increase in recognized production tax credits and favorable impacts of rate making in 2019. 37 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months Revenues Earnings * Revenues Earnings * 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Manufacturing $ 16,206 $ 15,927 $ 2,527 $ 2,529 $ 31,276 $ 30,649 $ 4,721 $ 4,736 Service and retailing 19,873 19,734 804 830 39,097 38,738 1,536 1,463 $ 36,079 $ 35,661 $ 70,373 $ 69,387 Pre-tax earnings 3,331 3,359 6,257 6,199 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 844 873 1,570 1,586 $ 2,487 $ 2,486 $ 4,687 $ 4,613 Effective income tax rate 24.7 % 25.5 % 24.6 % 25.1 % * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which were primarily from the amortization of identified intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings in the preceding table were $188 million in the second quarter and $380 million in first six months of 2019, compared to $220 million in the second quarter and $438 million in the first six months of 2018. These expenses are included in “Other” in the summary of earnings on page 27 and in the “Other” earnings section on page 44. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. The industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (“CTB”)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (“LSPI”)). Marmon includes UTLX Company (“UTLX”), which provides various products and services (including equipment leasing) for the rail and mobile crane industries. The building products group includes homebuilding and manufactured housing finance (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and the Duracell Company (“Duracell”), a manufacturer of high performance alkaline batteries. This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months Revenues Pre-tax earnings Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Industrial products $ 7,887 $ 7,851 $ 1,552 $ 1,564 $ 15,564 $ 15,470 $ 2,983 $ 3,032 Building products 5,369 4,850 726 649 9,931 8,930 1,208 1,096 Consumer products 2,950 3,226 249 316 5,781 6,249 530 608 $ 16,206 $ 15,927 $ 2,527 $ 2,529 $ 31,276 $ 30,649 $ 4,721 $ 4,736 Aggregate revenues of our manufacturing businesses in the second quarter of 2019 were $16.2 billion, an increase of 1.8% compared to 2018 and in the first six months were $31.3 billion, an increase of 2.0%. Pre-tax earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 were $2.5 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, slightly lower than earnings in the comparable 2018 periods. 38 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Industrial products Revenues of the industrial products group were $7.9 billion in the second quarter and $15.6 billion in the first six months of 2019, increases of 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively, over revenues in the comparable 2018 periods. Pre-tax earnings of the group were $1.55 billion in the second quarter and $3.0 billion in the first six months of 2019, decreases of 0.8% and 1.6% compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 19.2% in the first six months of 2019 compared to 19.6% in 2018. PCC’s revenues were $2.6 billion in the second quarter and $5.2 billion in the first six months of 2019, increases of $32 million (1.2%) and $111 million (2.2%) compared to 2018. The increases reflected higher demand in aerospace markets in connection with new aircraft programs, partly offset by lower industrial gas turbine products sales and lower sales of certain pipe products, primarily attributable to U.S tariffs. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 10.7% in the second quarter and 7.1% in the first six months of 2019 compared to 2018. The earnings increases reflected higher earnings from aerospace products and the impact of costs incurred in 2018 related to the temporary unplanned shutdown of certain metals facilities and metal press outages, partially offset by lower earnings from industrial gas turbine business. While demand for aerospace products continues to be relatively high, we have incurred incremental production and other costs to meet required deliveries to customers, which has negatively affected margins and earnings. However, we expect costs will gradually decline as we increase production capacity where needed and further improve processes and reduce inefficiencies. Lubrizol’s revenues were $1.7 billion in the second quarter and $3.4 billion in the first six months of 2019, decreases of $76 million (4.3%) and $139 million (3.9%), respectively, as compared to 2018. The declines were primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by higher average selling prices, which were necessitated by raw material cost increases in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 declined 3% and 4%, respectively, from 2018, reflecting reduced volumes in both the Additives and Advanced Materials product lines. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings decreased 1.3% in the second quarter and 3.2% in the first six months of 2019 compared to 2018. Earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 were negatively affected by lower sales volumes, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and increased operating expenses, which were partly offset by improved margins. Marmon’s revenues were $2.16 billion in the second quarter and $4.15 billion in the first six months of 2019, increases of $59 million (2.8%) and $81 million (2.0%), respectively, as compared to 2018. The increases reflected higher volumes in the Retail Solutions and Electrical Products sectors, increased volumes in railcar repair services in the second quarter, increased volumes in the Transportation Products sector (primarily in the first quarter) and the effects of business acquisitions. These increases were partly offset by lower distribution volumes in the Metals Services sector, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and the divestiture of an aftermarket parts product line in the Food & Beverage sector in the second quarter of 2018. Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 decreased $52 million (13.4%) and $62 million (8.9%), respectively, compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of sales fell to 15.3% in the first six months of 2019 as compared to 17.1% in 2018. Pre-tax earnings in the 2018 periods included a gain of $44 million realized on the divestiture in the Food & Beverage sector. In 2019, we also experienced lower earnings attributable to lower rail tank car leasing rates coupled with higher rail tank car maintenance expenses in the Rail Products & Leasing sector and declines in the Metals Services and Industrial Products sectors, which were partially offset by earnings increases in the Water, Transportation Products and Retail Solutions sectors and from business acquisitions. IMC’s revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 declined 2.3% and 1.7%, respectively, versus the corresponding 2018 periods, reflecting increased revenues from recent business acquisitions, offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 10% in the first six months of 2019 versus 2018, attributable to increased average raw material costs, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and changes in business mix. CTB’s revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 increased 4.2% and 4.1%, respectively, versus the same periods in 2018, primarily due to increased revenues from protein equipment and processing systems, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar. CTB’s pre-tax earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 increased 41% and 29% versus 2018, primarily due to the revenue increases, moderation of average costs of certain raw materials, better pricing efficiency and ongoing efforts to control operating expenses. 39 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Building products Revenues of the building products group were $5.4 billion in the second quarter and $9.9 billion in the first six months of 2019, increases of $519 million (10.7%) and $1.0 billion (11.2%), respectively, compared to second quarter and first six months of 2018. Pre-tax earnings of the group were $726 million in the second quarter and $1.2 billion in the first six months of 2019, increases of 11.9% and 10.2%, respectively, over 2018. Pre-tax earnings represented 12.2% and 12.3% of revenues in the first six months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Clayton Homes revenues were approximately $1.9 billion in the second quarter and $3.4 billion in the first six months of 2019, increases of $382 million (25%) and $689 million (25%), respectively, over the same periods in 2018. The comparative increases were primarily due to increased home sales of $346 million (31%) in the second quarter and $627 million (32%) year-to-date and a 7% year-to-date increase in interest income from lending activities. The sales increase reflected changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site built homes increased 142% in the second quarter and 148% in the first six months of 2019 over 2018, primarily due to business acquisitions, while manufactured homes sold at retail and wholesale declined 3% in the second quarter and 6% in the first six months of 2019. The increase in income from lending activities was attributable to increased average outstanding loan balances. As of June 30, 2019, aggregate loan balances outstanding were approximately $15.2 billion, compared to $14.2 billion as of June 30, 2018. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $282 million in the second quarter and $497 million in the first six months of 2019, increases of $48 million (20%) and $68 million (16%), respectively, compared to 2018. The increases were primarily attributable to home building activities, which reflected the increases in home sales. A significant part of Clayton Homes’ earnings derives from manufactured housing lending activities. Pre-tax earnings from lending and finance activities in the first six months of 2019 increased 2% compared to 2018, reflecting increased interest income and other financial services income, substantially offset by higher interest expense, attributable to higher average borrowings and interest rates, and to higher operating costs. Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses increased $138 million (4%) in the second quarter and $312 million (5%) in the first six months of 2019 versus 2018. These increases were primarily attributable to higher hard surface flooring products and roofing systems volumes and generally higher average prices, partly offset by lower carpet volumes. Additionally, the increases in average selling prices of these businesses were in response to rising raw material and other production costs over the past year. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were $445 million in the second quarter and $711 million in the first six months of 2019, increases of 7%, respectively, over the corresponding 2018 periods. The ratio of pre-tax earnings to revenues in the first six months of 2019 was relatively unchanged compared to 2018. As previously noted, rising raw material and production cost increases prevailed over the past year. In particular, the cost increases for steel, titanium dioxide, and certain petrochemicals were significant. Over the first half of 2019, these cost increases moderated. Consumer products Consumer products revenues were $2.95 billion in the second quarter and $5.8 billion in the first six months of 2019, decreases of $276 million (8.6%) and $468 million (7.5%), respectively, versus 2018. Revenues in 2019 declined at Forest River, Duracell and the apparel and footwear businesses. Revenues of Forest River declined 11% in the second quarter and 13% in the first six months versus 2018, primarily attributable to lower unit sales. Revenues of Duracell declined 7% in the first six months of 2019 compared to the prior year period, primarily attributable to customers delaying orders to the third quarter of 2019, lower sales in certain foreign markets and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation. Apparel and footwear revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 declined 7% and 1%, respectively, compared to 2018. The declines reflected the unexpected product shipping delays associated with a Brooks Sports distribution center that opened in the second quarter of 2019, which contributed to a 32% comparative decline in its second quarter revenues. Consumer products pre-tax earnings were $249 million in the second quarter and $530 million in the first six months of 2019, decreases of $67 million (21.2%) and $78 million (12.8%), respectively, compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the first six months were 9.2% in 2019 and 9.7% in 2018. The declines in pre-tax earnings were primarily attributable to Forest River, Brooks Sports, and Duracell. 40 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months Revenues Pre-tax earnings Revenues Pre-tax earnings 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Service $ 3,436 $ 3,378 $ 502 $ 533 $ 6,854 $ 6,551 $ 974 $ 948 Retailing 4,026 3,929 243 230 7,633 7,571 392 388 McLane Company 12,411 12,427 59 67 24,610 24,616 170 127 $ 19,873 $ 19,734 $ 804 $ 830 $ 39,097 $ 38,738 $ 1,536 $ 1,463 Service Our service business group offers fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI), franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen) and offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), publication of newspapers and other publications (Buffalo News and the BH Media Group) and operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Service group revenues were $3.44 billion in the second quarter and $6.85 billion in the first six months of 2019, increases of $58 million (1.7%) and $303 million (4.6%), respectively, as compared to 2018. Revenues of TTI increased 2.3% in the second quarter and 8.5% in the first six months of 2019, attributable to increased demand for electronic components in the first quarter and the effects of business acquisitions, partly offset by foreign currency translation effects of a stronger average U.S. Dollar. TTI’s revenues slowed considerably in the second quarter, attributable to reduced customer demand and lower sales prices. We currently believe demand and revenues in the third quarter of 2019 will be somewhat lower than in 2018. The comparative increases in service revenues in 2019 also reflected modest increases at NetJets and our other leasing businesses and decreases in the media businesses and Charter Brokerage, which is curtailing a high revenue, low margin business. The increases in NetJets revenues were primarily due to increases in the number of aircraft on lease and flight hours. Pre-tax earnings of the service group were $502 million in the second quarter of 2019, a decrease of $31 million (5.8%) compared to 2018, and $974 million in the first six months, an increase of $26 million (2.7%) over the first six months of 2018. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 14.2% in the first six months of 2019 compared to 14.5% in 2018. The decline in earnings for the second quarter was primarily due to lower earnings from TTI, attributable to generally lower sales margins and increased operating expenses. The decrease was partly offset by increased earnings from NetJets, primarily attributable to increased revenues and improved operating margins. The year-to-date increase primarily reflected increased earnings from NetJets partly offset by lower earnings from TTI. 41 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Retailing Our retailers include Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”). BHA includes over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories. Retailing group revenues were $4.0 billion in the second quarter and $7.6 billion in the first six months of 2019, increases of $97 million (2.5%) and $62 million (0.8%), respectively, compared to 2018. BHA’s revenues, which represented approximately 64% of our aggregate retailing revenues, increased 3.4% in the second quarter and 2.3% in the first six months of 2019, as compared to 2018. BHA’s revenue increases reflected year-to-date increases in pre-owned vehicle sales of 9% and revenues from finance and service contract activities and vehicle repair work of 7%, partly offset by a 3% reduction in new auto sales. Revenues of our home furnishings businesses declined 3% in the first six months of 2019 versus 2018, attributable to soft consumer demand and unfavorable weather in certain regions. Revenues of See’s Candies increased 43% in the second quarter of 2019 and 3% in the first six months as compared to 2018, primarily attributable to the seasonal effects of the timing of the Easter holiday. Retail group pre-tax earnings were $243 million in the second quarter and $392 million in the first six months of 2019, increases of 5.7% and 1.0%, respectively, over the comparable 2018 periods. Comparative pre-tax earnings of BHA increased 20% in the second quarter and 26% in the first six months of 2019, primarily due to finance and service contract activities and increased investment income, partly offset by higher floorplan interest expense. Pre-tax earnings in the first six months of 2019 from our home furnishings businesses declined 23% versus 2018, reflecting lower revenues and generally higher operating expenses. Pre-tax earnings of See’s Candies increased in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018, attributable to the revenue increase previously noted. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprise approximately two-thirds of McLane’s consolidated sales with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues were $12.4 billion in the second quarter and $24.6 billion in the first six months of 2019, relatively unchanged from the corresponding 2018 periods. Revenues in the first six months of 2019 included a 2% decrease in grocery sales and a 4% increase in foodservice sales as compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings were $59 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $8 million (12%) compared to 2018 and $170 million in the first six months of 2019, an increase of $43 million (34%) over 2018. Earnings in the second quarter of 2019 were reduced by an increase in LIFO inventory valuation allowances, which partially offset the effects of lower LIFO inventory valuation allowances in the first quarter. Results in 2019 also included increased average gross sales margins, partly offset by increased operating expenses, which were primarily employee-related costs. McLane continues to operate in an intensely competitive business environment, which is negatively affecting its current operating results and contributing to low operating margin rates. We expect these operating conditions will continue over the remainder of 2019. 42 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains/losses follows (dollars in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 Investment gains (losses) $ 9,835 $ 5,990 $ 29,387 $ (1,819 ) Derivative gains (losses) 213 372 983 166 Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 10,048 6,362 30,370 (1,653 ) Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 2,114 1,244 6,330 (345 ) Net gains (losses) $ 7,934 $ 5,118 $ 24,040 $ (1,308 ) Effective income tax rate 21.0 % 19.9 % 20.8 % 18.3 % Investment gains/losses Due to a new accounting pronouncement adopted as of January 1, 2018, pre-tax investment gains/losses reported in earnings include unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities. Pre-tax investment gains included net unrealized gains of approximately $9.8 billion in the second quarter and $29.2 billion in the first six months of 2019 attributable to equity securities we still held at June 30, 2019. By comparison, we recorded pre-tax investment gains of approximately $5.6 billion in the second quarter and pre-tax losses of approximately $2.1 billion in the first six months of 2018 with respect to equity securities we still held at June 30, 2018. Prior to 2018, investment gains/losses on equity securities were recorded when securities were sold based on the cost of the disposed securities. While the new accounting standard does not change the effect on our consolidated shareholders’ equity or total comprehensive income, it has significantly increased the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Investment gains/losses from periodic changes in securities prices will continue to cause significant volatility in our consolidated earnings. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings, including the changes in market prices for equity securities in any given period, has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities. These liabilities relate to contracts entered into before March 2008. Substantially all of these contracts will expire between August 2019 and February 2023. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying equity markets and the changes in the inputs used to measure such liabilities. As of June 30, 2019, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was $791 million and our recorded liabilities at fair value were $1.47 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. Contracts with an aggregate notional value of $2.2 billion expired in the second quarter of 2019. Contracts with an aggregate notional value of $10.0 billion will expire over the remainder of 2019. There were no settlement payments required with respect to the contracts that expired in 2019. Pre-tax gains from equity index put option contracts were $213 million in the second quarter and $983 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to pre-tax gains of $372 million in the second quarter and $166 million in the first six months of 2018. The gains in 2019 were primarily due to higher equity index values and shorter average remaining contract durations. 43 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). Second Quarter First Six Months 2019 2018 2019 2018 Equity method earnings $ 131 $ 285 $ 297 $ 625 Acquisition accounting expenses (188 ) (220 ) (380 ) (438 ) Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects (72 ) (82 ) (146 ) (159 ) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes (87 ) 323 47 160 Income tax expense adjustment — — (377 ) — Other 204 126 418 256 Net earnings (losses) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $ (12 ) $ 432 $ (141 ) $ 444 After-tax equity method earnings include Berkshire’s share of earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz, Pilot Flying J, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. As discussed in Note 5 to the accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements, financial statements of Kraft Heinz for the first and second quarters of 2019 were not made available to us. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements do not include our share of Kraft Heinz’s earnings for those periods. After-tax equity method earnings related to our Kraft Heinz investment were $187 million in the second quarter and $421 million in the first six months of 2018. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. The aggregate par amount of Berkshire’s outstanding Euro denominated debt was €6.85 billion during the first six months of 2019 and 2018. In addition, BHFC issued debt of £1.75 billion par amount on June 19, 2019. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced non-cash unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The income tax expense adjustment in the first six months of 2019 relates to investments that we made between 2015 and 2018 in certain tax equity investment funds. Our investments in these funds aggregated approximately $340 million. In December 2018 and during the first quarter of 2019, we learned of allegations by federal authorities of fraudulent income conduct by the sponsor of these funds. As a result of our investigation into these allegations, we now believe that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefits that we recognized are not valid. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at June 30, 2019 was $382.5 billion, an increase of $33.8 billion since December 31, 2018. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in the first six months of 2019 were $35.7 billion, which included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $23.3 billion, which was primarily due to increases in market prices of the equity securities we owned at June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2019, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $119.1 billion, which included $93.9 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $220.5 billion. Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at June 30, 2019 was $16.8 billion, relatively unchanged since December 31, 2018. Berkshire parent company debt of $750 million matures in August 2019. Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $19.2 billion at June 30, 2019, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of $12.1 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and a portion of assets held for lease by our UTLX railcar leasing business. In the first quarter of 2019, BHFC repaid $2.7 billion of maturing senior notes and issued $2.0 billion of 4.25% senior notes due in 2049. In June 2019, BHFC also issued £1.0 billion of 2.375% senior notes due in 2039 and £750 million of 2.625% senior notes due in 2059. BHFC senior notes of $1.25 billion will mature in August 2019. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. 44 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition (Continued) Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of these two operations in the first six months of 2019 were $4.3 billion and we forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $7.0 billion over the remainder of 2019. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.2 billion as of June 30, 2019, which was substantially unchanged since December 31, 2018. BNSF debentures of $750 million will mature in October 2019. In July 2019, BNSF issued $825 million of 3.55% senior unsecured debentures due in 2050. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $40.7 billion at June 30, 2019, an increase of $1.4 billion since December 31, 2018. In the first six months of 2019, BHE and its subsidiaries issued debt aggregating $3.4 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2029 to 2050 and repaid approximately $1.7 billion of maturing term debt. The proceeds from these financings were used to repay borrowings, to fund capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes. BHE subsidiary term debt of $427 million will mature over the remainder of 2019. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program was amended on July 17, 2018, permitting Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In the first six months of 2019, Berkshire repurchased shares of Class A and B common stock for an aggregate cost of $2.1 billion. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future are not currently reflected in the financial statements, which will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. Beginning in 2019, operating lease obligations are included in the consolidated balance sheet due to the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. As disclosed in Note 23 to the accompanying Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, we are committed to invest $10 billion in newly issued preferred stock and common stock warrants of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, subject to the completion of its pending acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation. In the first six months of 2019, Berkshire subsidiaries issued new term debt. Principal and interest payments associated with these new borrowings are expected as follows: 2019-$121 million; 2020-2021-$541 million; 2022-2023-$541 million; and thereafter-$13.4 billion. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2019 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in the “Contractual Obligations” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 45 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2019 includes estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts of $112.3 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing loss reserve amounts, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude will result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2019 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $81.3 billion. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2018. Although we believe that the goodwill reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is not impaired, goodwill may subsequently become impaired due to changes in facts and circumstances affecting the valuation of the reporting unit. A goodwill impairment charge could have a material effect on periodic earnings. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of June 30, 2019, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. 46 Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 to which reference is made herein. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities For several years, Berkshire had a common stock repurchase program, which permitted Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. On July 17, 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the program, permitting Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the second quarter of 2019 follows. Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced program Maximum number or value of shares that yet may be repurchased under the program April 1 through April 10: Class A common stock 226 $ 305,872.16 226 * May 28 through May 31: Class B common stock 1,032,233 $ 198.90 1,032,233 * June 3 through June 26: Class A common stock 55 $ 311,292.99 55 * Class B common stock 733,907 $ 205.16 733,907 * * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $20 billion.

General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire or Company) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms us, we or our refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshires most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshires businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. As described in the Annual Report, we modified certain presentations to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Presentations in these interim Consolidated Financial Statements conform to the presentations in the Annual Report. Changes to those policies due to the adoption of a new accounting standard is described in Note 2. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. In light of the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, changes in the fair values of certain derivative contract liabilities and gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements Berkshire adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842 Leases on January 1, 2019. Most significantly, ASC 842 requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make lease payments and an asset with respect to its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Upon the adoption of ASC 842, we recognized operating lease assets of approximately $6.2 billion and lease liabilities of $5.9 billion. We also reduced other assets by approximately $300 million. Consequently, our consolidated assets and liabilities increased by approximately $5.9 billion. We are party to contracts where we lease property from others (lessee contracts) and where we lease property to others (lessor contracts). In adopting and applying ASC 842, we elected to use practical expedients, including but not limited to, not reassessing past lease and easement accounting, not separating lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and not recording assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less. We adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 with regard to contracts in effect as of that date and elected to not restate prior period financial statements. ASC 842 did not have a material effect on our accounting for our lessor contracts or for lessee contracts classified as financing leases. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate. The lease term is generally the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage or changes in an index or interest rates. Options are not included in determining lease assets or liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Lease assets are subject to review for impairment. On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01 Financial InstrumentsRecognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, ASU 2018-02 Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and ASC 606 Revenues from Contracts with Customers. Prior year financial statements were not restated. A summary of the effects of the initial adoption of ASU 2016-01, ASU 2018-02 and ASC 606 on our shareholders equity follows (in millions). Increase (decrease): Accumulated other comprehensive income Retained earnings Shareholders equity With respect to ASU 2016-01, beginning in 2018, unrealized gains and losses from the changes in the fair values of our equity securities during the period are included within investment gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of January 1, 2018, we reclassified net after-tax unrealized gains on equity securities from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. 7 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements (Continued) In adopting ASU 2018-02, we reclassified the stranded deferred income tax effects arising from the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that were included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of January 1, 2018 to retained earnings. In adopting ASC 606, we recorded increases to certain assets and other liabilities, with the cumulative net effect recorded to retained earnings. Prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized revenues from the sales of fractional ownership interests in aircraft over the term of the related management services agreements, as the transfers of the ownership interests were inseparable from the management services agreements. These agreements also include provisions that require us to repurchase the fractional interest at fair market value at contract termination or upon the customers request following the end of a minimum commitment period. ASC 606 provides that such contracts are subject to accounting guidance for lease contracts. The principal effects of this re-characterization were to increase equipment held for lease and aircraft repurchase liabilities and unearned lease revenues by approximately $3.5 billion. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses, which provides for the recognition and measurement at the reporting date of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost and for available-for-sale debt securities. Currently, credit losses are recognized and measured when such losses become probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. ASU 2016-13 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. ASU 2017-04 eliminates the requirement to determine the implied value of goodwill in measuring an impairment loss. Upon adoption of ASU 2017-04, the measurement of a goodwill impairment will represent the excess of the reporting units carrying value over its fair value and will be limited to the carrying value of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts. ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used to value policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs arising from the issuance of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts, with the effects of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount rate assumptions reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 3. Investments in fixed maturity securities Investments in fixed maturity securities as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are summarized by type below (in millions). March 31, 2019 U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies States, municipalities and political subdivisions Foreign governments Corporate bonds Mortgage-backed securities December 31, 2018 U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies States, municipalities and political subdivisions Foreign governments Corporate bonds Mortgage-backed securities Investments in foreign governments include securities issued by national and provincial government entities as well as instruments that are unconditionally guaranteed by such entities. As of March 31, 2019, approximately 88% of our foreign government holdings were rated AA or higher by at least one of the major rating agencies. 8 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3. Investments in fixed maturity securities (Continued) The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities at March 31, 2019 are summarized below by contractual maturity dates. Amounts are in millions. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to early call or prepayment rights held by issuers. Amortized cost Fair value Note 4. Investments in equity securities Investments in equity securities as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are summarized based on the primary industry of the investee in the table below (in millions). March 31, 2019 * Banks, insurance and finance Consumer products Commercial, industrial and other Approximately 68% of the aggregate fair value was concentrated in five companies (American Express Company  $16.6 billion; Apple Inc.  $48.5 billion; Bank of America Corporation  $25.4 billion; The Coca-Cola Company  $18.7 billion and Wells Fargo & Company  $20.9 billion). December 31, 2018 * Banks, insurance and finance Consumer products Commercial, industrial and other Approximately 68% of the aggregate fair value was concentrated in five companies (American Express Company  $14.5 billion; Apple Inc.  $40.3 billion; Bank of America Corporation  $22.6 billion; The Coca-Cola Company  $18.9 billion and Wells Fargo & Company  $20.7 billion). Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (Kraft Heinz). Kraft Heinz is one of the worlds largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 325,442,152 shares of Kraft Heinz common stock representing 26.7% of the outstanding shares. Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $10.6 billion at March 31, 2019 and $14.0 billion at December 31, 2018. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $13.7 billion at March 31, 2019 and $13.8 billion at December 31, 2018. As of May 3, 2019, Kraft Heinz has not filed its 2018 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, Kraft Heinz has not made its financial statements for the first quarter of 2019 available to Berkshire. Accordingly, Berkshire does not have the necessary financial information to determine its share of the earnings and other comprehensive income of Kraft Heinz for the first quarter of 2019. As a result, Berkshires first quarter 2019 earnings and other comprehensive income exclude such amounts. Berkshire will record its share of Kraft Heinzs earnings and other comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2019 during the period that such information becomes available. We recorded equity method earnings in the first quarter of 2018 of approximately $265 million. We received dividends on the common stock of $130 million and $203 million in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively, which we recorded as reductions of our investment. 9 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5. Equity method investments (Continued) Summarized unaudited financial information of Kraft Heinz as of December 29, 2018 and for the first quarter of 2018 follows (in millions). Assets Liabilities Sales Net earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz common shareholders Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (Berkadia), Pilot Travel Centers LLC, d/b/a Pilot Flying J (Pilot Flying J), and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (ETT). The carrying value of our investments in these entities was approximately $3.6 billion as of March 31, 2019 and $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2018. Our equity method earnings in these entities in the first quarter were $167 million in 2019 and $136 million in 2018. Additional information concerning these investments follows. We own a 50% interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (Jefferies), formerly known as Leucadia National Corporation, owning the other 50% interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A source of funding for Berkadias operations is through its issuance of commercial paper, which is currently limited to $1.5 billion. On March 31, 2019, Berkadias commercial paper outstanding was $1.47 billion. The commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. In addition, a Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company subsidiary owns a 50% interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint. American Electric Power owns the other 50% interest. On October 3, 2017, we entered into an investment agreement and an equity purchase agreement whereby we acquired a 38.6% interest in Pilot Flying J, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot Flying J is one of the largest operators of travel centers in North America, with more than 28,000 team members, 750 locations across the U.S. and Canada, and nearly $30 billion in annual revenues. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1% interest in Pilot Flying J and a third party owns the remaining 11.3% interest. We also entered into an agreement to acquire in 2023 an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot Flying J with the Haslam family retaining a 20% interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot Flying J in 2023. Note 6. Investment gains/losses Investment gains/losses in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 are summarized as follows (in millions). Equity securities: Unrealized investment gains (losses) on securities held at the end of the period Investment gains (losses) during the period Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains Gross realized losses Other Prior to 2018, we recognized investment gains and losses in earnings when we sold equity securities based on the difference between the proceeds from the sale and the cost of the securities and also when we recognized other-than-temporary impairment losses. Beginning in 2018, equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own. Prior to 2018, we recorded the changes in unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities in other comprehensive income. 10 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 6. Investment gains/losses (Continued) In the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains/losses on equity securities sold in each period reflect the difference between proceeds from sales and the fair value of the equity security sold at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Our taxable gains on equity securities sold during the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, which are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and our original cost, were $518 million and $727 million, respectively. Note 7. Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are summarized as follows (in millions). Loans and finance receivables before allowances and discounts Allowances for uncollectible loans Unamortized acquisition discounts Loans and finance receivables are principally installment loans originated or acquired by our manufactured housing business. Provisions for loan losses for the first quarter were $32 million in 2019 and $34 million in 2018. Loan charge-offs, net of recoveries in the first quarter, were $33 million in 2019 and $35 million in 2018. At March 31, 2019, approximately 98% of the manufactured housing loan balances were evaluated collectively for impairment, with the remainder evaluated individually. As part of the evaluation process, credit quality indicators are reviewed and loans are designated as performing or non-performing. At March 31, 2019, we considered approximately 99% of the loan balances to be performing and approximately 97% of the loan balances to be current as to payment status. Additionally, during 2018, an insurance subsidiary entered into an agreement with Seritage Growth Properties to provide a $2.0 billion term loan facility, which matures on July 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the outstanding loans under the facility were approximately $1.6 billion. Note 8.

Note 12. Leases We are party to contracts where we lease property from others. As a lessee, we primarily lease office and operating facilities, locomotives, freight cars, energy generation facilities and transmission assets. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities included in our March 31, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet were approximately $6.2 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively. Such amounts were included in other assets and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The weighted average term of these leases was approximately 7.7 years and the weighted average discount rate used to measure lease liabilities was approximately 3.9%.

Goodwill and other intangible assets (Continued) Our other intangible assets and related accumulated amortization are summarized as follows (in millions). Insurance and other Railroad, utilities and energy Trademarks and trade names Patents and technology Customer relationships Other Intangible asset amortization expense in the first quarter was $333 million in 2019 and $352 million in 2018. Intangible assets with indefinite lives as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were $18.9 billion and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. Note 14. Derivative contracts We are party to derivative contracts through certain of our subsidiaries. Currently, the most significant derivative contracts consist of equity index put option contracts. The liabilities and related notional values of these contracts follows (in millions). March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Notional value represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming that the value of each index is zero at each contracts expiration date. Certain of these contracts are denominated in foreign currencies. Notional amounts are based on the foreign currency exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. We recorded pre-tax gains of $770 million in the first quarter of 2019 and losses of $206 million in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to our equity index put option contracts. The equity index put option contracts are European style options written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. The remaining contracts expire between April 2019 and October 2025. The weighted average life of unexpired contracts at March 31, 2019 was approximately 1.65 years. Contracts with notional values of $12.2 billion will expire over the remainder of 2019. Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike price at the expiration date. We received aggregate premiums of $4.0 billion on the contract inception dates with respect to unexpired contracts at March 31, 2019 and we have no counterparty credit risk. The aggregate intrinsic value (the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date) was $957 million at March 31, 2019 and $1,653 million at December 31, 2018. These contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the expiration dates and the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses on these contracts will not be determined until the contract expiration dates. A limited number of our equity index put option contracts contain collateral posting requirements with respect to changes in the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts and/or a downgrade of Berkshires credit ratings. As of March 31, 2019, we did not have any collateral posting requirements. If Berkshires credit ratings (currently AA from Standard & Poors and Aa2 from Moodys) are downgraded below either A- by Standard & Poors or A3 by Moodys, collateral of up to $1.1 billion could be required to be posted. Our regulated utility subsidiaries are exposed to variations in the prices of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity purchased and sold and natural gas supplied for customers. We may use forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options to manage a portion of these price risks. Most of the net derivative contract assets or liabilities of our regulated utilities are probable of recovery through rates and are offset by regulatory liabilities or assets. Derivative contract assets are included in other assets and were $171 million as of March 31, 2019 and $172 million as of December 31, 2018. Derivative contract liabilities are included in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities and were $99 million as of March 31, 2019 and $111 million as of December 31, 2018. 14 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15. Supplemental cash flow information A summary of supplemental cash flow information for the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 is presented in the following table (in millions). Cash paid during the period for: Income taxes Interest: Insurance and other Railroad, utilities and energy Non-cash investing and financing activities: Liabilities assumed in connection with business acquisitions Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities Note 16. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as claim liabilities) under short-duration property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (IBNR) claims. Reconciliations of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 17), for each of the three months ending March 31, 2019 and 2018 follow (in millions). Balances  beginning of year: Gross liabilities Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses Net liabilities Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events Prior accident years events Total incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year events Prior accident years events Total payments Foreign currency translation adjustment Balances  March 31: Net liabilities Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses Gross liabilities Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter of 2019 included a net increase of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $112 million compared to a net decrease of $753 million in the first quarter of 2018. Increases and decreases in estimated ultimate liabilities produce corresponding decreases and increases to pre-tax earnings. Such amounts as percentages of net liabilities at the beginning of the year were 0.2% in 2019 and 1.3% in 2018. 15 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) In the first quarter of 2019, we reduced estimated ultimate liabilities of primary insurance for prior years events by $100 million, compared to a reduction of $571 million in 2018. In each period, these liability reductions primarily derived from private passenger automobile, medical malpractice and workers compensation insurance, although the liability reductions in the first quarter of 2019 were lower than in the first quarter of 2018 for private passenger automobile and medical malpractice. In addition, we increased estimated liabilities in the first quarter of 2019 for legacy casualty exposures and other commercial insurance business. In the first quarter of 2019, we increased estimated ultimate property and casualty reinsurance liabilities for prior years events by $212 million, compared to a decrease of $182 million in the first quarter of 2018. The losses in 2019 derived primarily from casualty claims. Note 17. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, if applicable, once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (claim liabilities) and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the three months ending March 31, 2019 and 2018 follows (in millions). Balances  beginning of year: Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses Current year contracts Prior years contracts Total Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses Balances  March 31: Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of deferred charges In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter related to contracts written in prior years were $275 million in 2019 and $241 million in 2018. Such losses reflected the periodic amortization of deferred charge assets and the effects of changes in the timing and amount of ultimate claim liabilities. In 2017, National Indemnity Company (NICO) entered into a contract with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, AIG). Our estimated ultimate claim liabilities with respect to the AIG contract at March 31, 2019 and at December 31, 2018 were $18.2 billion. Deferred charge assets related to the AIG contract were approximately $6.8 billion at March 31, 2019 and $6.9 billion at December 31, 2018. 16 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 18. Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of March 31, 2019. Insurance and other: Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire): U.S. Dollar denominated due 2019-2047 Euro denominated due 2020-2035 Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC) due 2019-2049 Other subsidiary borrowings due 2019-2045 Subsidiary short-term borrowings The carrying value of Berkshires Euro denominated senior notes reflects the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. The gains or losses arising from the changes in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate resulted in pre-tax gains of $170 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to pre-tax losses of $217 million in the first quarter of 2018. The carrying values of the Euro denominated senior notes reflected corresponding decreases with respect to the gains and increases with respect to the losses in those periods. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain finance subsidiaries. In the first quarter of 2019, BHFC issued $2.0 billion of 4.25% senior notes due in 2049 and repaid $2.7 billion of maturing notes. Such borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In addition to BHFCs borrowings, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $1.6 billion of other subsidiary borrowings at March 31, 2019. Generally, Berkshires guarantee of a subsidiarys debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. Railroad, utilities and energy: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (BHE) and subsidiaries: BHE senior unsecured debt due 2020-2049 Subsidiary and other debt due 2019-2064 Short-term borrowings Burlington Northern Santa Fe and subsidiaries due 2019-2097 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. During the first quarter of 2019, BHE and its subsidiaries issued approximately $3.0 billion of long-term debt. The debt issued in 2019 has maturity dates ranging from 2029 to 2050 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%. Proceeds from these debt issuances were used to repay debt, to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. BNSFs borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. As of March 31, 2019, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2019, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $7.3 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included approximately $5.8 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. 17 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19. Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, receivables and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of their fair values. March 31, 2019 Investments in fixed maturity securities: U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies States, municipalities and political subdivisions Foreign governments Corporate bonds Mortgage-backed securities Investments in equity securities Investment in Kraft Heinz common stock Loans and finance receivables Derivative contract assets (1) Derivative contract liabilities: Railroad, utilities and energy (1) Equity index put options Notes payable and other borrowings: Insurance and other Railroad, utilities and energy December 31, 2018 Investments in fixed maturity securities: U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies States, municipalities and political subdivisions Foreign governments Corporate bonds Mortgage-backed securities Investments in equity securities Investment in Kraft Heinz common stock Loans and finance receivables Derivative contract assets (1) Derivative contract liabilities: Railroad, utilities and energy (1) Equity index put options Notes payable and other borrowings: Insurance and other Railroad, utilities and energy Assets are included in other assets and liabilities are included in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities. 18 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19. Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1  Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2  Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3  Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 follow (in millions). Three months ending March 31, 2019 Balance at December 31, 2018 Gains (losses) included in: Earnings Other comprehensive income Regulatory assets and liabilities Acquisitions, dispositions and settlements Transfers into/out of Level 3 Balance at March 31, 2019 Three months ending March 31, 2018 Balance at December 31, 2017 Gains (losses) included in: Earnings Other comprehensive income Regulatory assets and liabilities Acquisitions, dispositions and settlements Balance at March 31, 2018 Gains and losses included in earnings are reported as components of derivative gains/losses and other revenues, as appropriate. 19 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 19. Fair value measurements (Continued) Quantitative information as of March 31, 2019, with respect to assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follows (in millions). Derivative contract liabilities  Equity index put options Our equity index put option contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts and certain of the contracts have relatively long durations. For these and other reasons, we classified these contracts as Level 3 measurements. The methods we use to value these contracts are those that we believe market participants would use in determining exchange prices with respect to our contracts. We value equity index put option contracts based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to this model include index price, contract duration and dividend and interest rate inputs (including a Berkshire non-performance input) which are observable. However, we believe that the valuation of long-duration options using any model is inherently subjective and, given the lack of observable transactions and prices, acceptable values may be subject to wide ranges. Volatility inputs represent our expectations, which consider the remaining duration of each contract and assume that the contracts will remain outstanding until the expiration dates. Increases or decreases in the volatility inputs will produce increases or decreases in the fair values of the liabilities. Note 20. Common stock Changes in Berkshires issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the first quarter of 2019 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Balance December 31, 2018 Conversions of Class A common stock to Class B common stock and exercises of replacement stock options Treasury stock acquired Balance at March 31, 2019 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,635,433 shares outstanding as of March 31, 2019 and 1,640,929 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding. 20 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 20. Common stock (Continued) For several years, Berkshire had a common stock repurchase program, which permitted Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. On July 17, 2018, Berkshires Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the program, permitting Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshires Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshires intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshires consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. Note 21. Accumulated other comprehensive income A summary of the net changes in after-tax accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders and amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income for the three months ending March 31, 2019 and 2018 follows (in millions). 2019 Balance at December 31, 2018 Other comprehensive income, net before reclassifications Reclassifications into net earnings: Reclassifications before income taxes Applicable income taxes Balance at March 31, 2019 2018 Balance at December 31, 2017 Reclassifications to retained earnings upon adoption of new accounting standards Other comprehensive income, net before reclassifications Reclassifications into net earnings: Reclassifications before income taxes Applicable income taxes Balance at March 31, 2018 Note 22. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates for the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 were 21.4% and 29.7%, respectively. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings and underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. In the first quarter of 2019, we recorded income tax expense of $377 million for uncertain tax positions related to investments in certain tax equity investment funds that generated income tax benefits from 2015 through 2018. We now believe that it is more likely than not those income tax benefits are not valid. 21 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 23. Revenues from contracts with customers On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 Revenues from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, revenues are recognized when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 (in millions). Other revenues included in consolidated revenues were primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues which are not within the scope of ASC 606.

Contingencies and Commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. On April 30, 2019, Berkshire committed to invest a total of $10 billion in Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Occidental) in connection with Occidentals proposal to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko). The investment is contingent upon Occidental entering into and completing its proposed acquisition of Anadarko. If completed, Berkshires investment would include newly issued Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $10 billion, together with warrants to purchase up to 80.0 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $62.50 per share. The preferred stock will accrue dividends at 8% per annum and will be redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing on the tenth anniversary of issuance at a redemption price equal to 105% of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, or mandatorily under certain specified capital return events. Dividends will be paid in cash or, at Occidentals option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants issued with the preferred stock may be exercised in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. Note 25. Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. The accompanying business segment information for the first quarter of 2018 reflects certain reclassifications to conform to presentations as of December 31, 2018. Specifically, business units that previously were reported as the finance and financial products segment in the first quarter of 2018 were reclassified to manufacturing (Clayton Homes and UTLX), services and retailing (CORT and XTRA leasing) and corporate and other (principally investment income). 23 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 25. Business segment data (Continued) Revenues and earnings or loss before income taxes by segment for the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions).

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions). Insurance  underwriting Insurance  investment income Railroad Utilities and energy Manufacturing, service and retailing Investment and derivative gains/losses Other Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Beginning in 2018, our periodic net earnings include changes in unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities. These gains and losses are likely to be exceptionally large given the size of our current holdings and the inherent volatility in securities prices. Prior to 2018, the changes in unrealized gains and losses pertaining to such investments were recorded in other comprehensive income. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $389 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $407 million in 2018. Results in 2019 and 2018 included net underwriting gains from primary insurance and net underwriting losses from reinsurance. After-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2019 from insurance investments increased 22.2% over 2018, reflecting increased short-term interest rates and dividend income. Our railroad business generated a 9.4% increase in after-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. Results in 2019 benefited from higher rates per car/unit and a curtailment gain related to an amendment to a retirement plan, partly offset by lower unit volume. Severe winter weather and flooding across the mid-U.S. in the first quarter of 2019 had a significant negative impact on freight volumes and operating results. Our utilities and energy business produced a 3.4% increase in after-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in the first quarter of 2019 increased 3.4% over 2018. First quarter 2019 results of our underlying business operations were mixed, with several of these businesses experiencing lower first quarter earnings from a variety of factors. After-tax investment and derivative gains in the first quarter of 2019 were $16.1 billion compared to after-tax losses of $6.4 billion in 2018. In the table above, investment and derivative gains/losses include a gain of approximately $15.1 billion in 2019 and a loss of approximately $7.0 billion in 2018 due to changes during the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 in the amount of unrealized gains that existed in our equity security investment holdings and also include after-tax realized gains on sales of equity and fixed maturity securities of $392 million and $747 million during the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or settlements or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 25 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations InsuranceUnderwriting Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities  underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshires Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshires corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as a component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held philosophy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods. Accordingly, we believe that such gains and losses are not necessarily meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance operations. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million (pre-tax) from a current year event as significant. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $111 billion as of March 31, 2019. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (BHRG) and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). Underwriting gain (loss): GEICO Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group Pre-tax underwriting gain Income taxes and noncontrolling interests Net underwriting gain Effective income tax rate GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICOs underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Premiums written Premiums earned Losses and loss adjustment expenses Underwriting expenses Total losses and expenses Pre-tax underwriting gain 26 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued) GEICO (Continued) Premiums written and earned in the first quarter of 2019 increased 6.6% and 8.9%, respectively, compared to 2018. These increases reflected voluntary auto policy-in-force growth of 3.6% and increased premiums per auto policy of approximately 4.0% over the past twelve months. The increase in premiums per policy was attributable to rate increases from 2018, coverage changes and changes in state and risk mix. The increases in rates were in response to accelerating losses. Voluntary auto new business sales in the first quarter of 2019 increased 6.2% compared to the first quarter of 2018, while our voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 342,000 during the first quarter of 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter of 2019 were approximately $6.6 billion, an increase of $481 million (7.9%) compared to 2018. GEICOs ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the loss ratio) in the first quarter of 2019 was 76.1%, a decline of 0.6 percentage points compared to the first quarter of 2018. GEICO reduced ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years loss events by $83 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $407 million in 2018. These reductions produced corresponding pre-tax underwriting gains. The gains in 2019 were primarily due to lower losses from collision, property damage and bodily injury claims, partially offset by higher losses from personal injury protection claims. Claims frequencies in the first quarter of 2019 for property damage and collision coverages and personal injury protection coverage were down (two to four percent range) compared to 2018 and were flat for bodily injury coverage. Average claims severities in the first quarter of 2019 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (six to eight percent range). Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2019 were approximately $1.3 billion, an increase of $133 million (11.4%) over 2018. GEICOs expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in the first quarter of 2019 was 15.0%, an increase of 0.3 percentage points compared to 2018. The underwriting expense increase was primarily attributable to increases in advertising expenses, insurance premium taxes and employee-related costs, which reflected wage and staffing increases. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (NICO), Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (BHLN) and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and General Re Life Corporation (collectively, General Re). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN. With the exception of our retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity product lines, we strive to generate pre-tax underwriting profits. Time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity premiums due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from these products through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRGs premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Property/casualty Retroactive reinsurance Life/health Periodic payment annuity 27 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued) Property/casualty A summary of property/casualty reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Premiums written Premiums earned Losses and loss adjustment expenses Underwriting expenses Total losses and expenses Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) Property/casualty premiums earned in the first quarter of 2019 were approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $296 million (14.6%) compared to 2018. The increase primarily reflected higher direct and broker markets business and derived primarily from new business and increased participations for renewal business in both property and casualty lines. Premiums earned in the first quarter included $432 million in 2019 and $448 million in 2018 from a 10-year, 20% quota-share contract entered into by NICO with Insurance Australia Group Limited, which expires in 2025. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2019 were approximately $1.8 billion, an increase of $383 million (27.5%) compared to 2018. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter of 2019 included increases in estimated ultimate claim liabilities attributable to prior years loss events of $212 million compared to decreases of $182 million in 2018, which produced corresponding decreases and increases in pre-tax underwriting gains. Such gains and losses were less than 1% of the unpaid claim liabilities as of the beginning of the applicable year. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2019 also reflected a decline in the overall loss ratio for current accident year business as compared to the first quarter of 2018. There were no significant catastrophe loss events in the first quarter of 2019 or 2018. Retroactive reinsurance There were no new retroactive reinsurance contracts written in the first quarter of 2019 or 2018. Pre-tax underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance contracts in the first quarter were $323 million in 2019 and $311 million in 2018. Certain liabilities related to retroactive reinsurance contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies. Underwriting results in the first quarter included pre-tax losses of $52 million in 2019 and $60 million in 2018 associated with the re-measurement of such liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses in the first quarter were $271 million in 2019 and $251 million in 2018, which derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amount of future claim payments. Deferred charge amortization in the first quarter included approximately $156 million in 2019 and $147 million in 2018 related to an aggregate excess-of-loss retroactive reinsurance agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $41.6 billion at March 31, 2019 and $41.8 billion at December 31, 2018. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were approximately $13.8 billion at March 31, 2019 and $14.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Deferred charge assets will be charged to pre-tax earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization. 28 Item 2.

Premiums written Premiums earned Life and health insurance benefits Underwriting expenses Total benefits and expenses Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) Life/health premiums earned in the first quarter of 2019 were approximately $1.0 billion, a decrease of $207 million (16.8%) compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to the effects of an amendment in the first quarter of 2019 to a reinsurance contract, partially offset by growth in the Asia life markets. In the first quarter of 2019, BHLN amended its yearly renewable term life insurance contract with a major U.S. reinsurer. The amendment effectively eliminates BHLNs exposure under the contract in the future. BHLN recorded a reduction in earned premiums on this contract of $49 million in the first quarter of 2019, largely attributable to the contract amendment. Premiums earned from this contract were $189 million in the first quarter of 2018 and approximately $1 billion for the year ending December 31, 2018. The life/health business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $280 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $96 million in 2018. Underwriting results in the first quarter of 2019 included a one-time pre-tax gain of approximately $160 million attributable to the BHLN contract amendment, which resulted in reductions of benefits incurred and premiums earned. First quarter underwriting results in 2019 also included increased gains from the run-off of variable annuity contracts, partially offset by increased losses from U.S. individual life business and the run-off of U.S. long-term care business. Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $89 million in the first quarter of 2019 versus $45 million in 2018. Underwriting results from this business reflect changes in estimated liabilities for guaranteed benefits, which result from changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Periodic payment annuity Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in the first quarter of 2019 were $194 million, a decrease of $86 million (30.7%) compared to 2018. Periodic payment business is price sensitive. The volumes written can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, and the level of competition. Periodic payment annuity contracts produced pre-tax losses in the first quarter of $170 million in 2019 and $173 million in 2018. Certain contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies. First quarter pre-tax underwriting results included pre-tax losses of $28 million in 2019 and $70 million in 2018 associated with the re-measurement of such liabilities due to changes in exchange rates. Before foreign currency gains and losses, pre-tax underwriting losses were $142 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $103 million in the first quarter of 2018. These losses derived primarily from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities, as well as the impact of mortality and interest rate changes. Discounted annuity liabilities approximated $12.7 billion at March 31, 2019 and $12.5 billion at December 31, 2018, reflecting a weighted average discount rate of approximately 4.1%. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (BH Primary) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (BH Specialty), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (BHHC), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (GUARD), and National Indemnity Company (NICO Primary). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Applied Underwriters, Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company, acquired October 1, 2018. 29 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations InsuranceUnderwriting (Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued) A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions). Premiums written Premiums earned Losses and loss adjustment expenses Underwriting expenses Total losses and expenses Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) Premiums written and earned in the first quarter of 2019 increased 8.3% and 12.1%, respectively, compared to 2018. The increases in premiums written were primarily attributable to BH Specialty (19.6%), GUARD (19.0%) and NICO Primary (11.9%). The increase in premiums earned in the first quarter of 2019 also reflected the impact of the MLMIC acquisition. BH Primary produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $30 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to pre-tax gains of $99 million in 2018. BH Primarys aggregate loss ratios for the first quarter were 73.0% in 2019 and 65.2% in 2018. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the first quarter for prior years loss events included reductions of $17 million in 2019 and $164 million in 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, we recorded additional estimated claim liabilities for legacy casualty exposures. In addition, the net gains from the reductions of prior accident years liabilities in 2019 were lower as compared to 2018. BH Primary units write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to higher severity and longer claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher than expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. InsuranceInvestment Income A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions). Interest and other investment income Dividend income Investment income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests Income taxes and noncontrolling interests Net investment income Effective income tax rate Pre-tax interest and other investment income in the first quarter of 2019 increased $61 million (13.5%) compared to 2018, attributable to an increase in interest income, primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term investments, partially offset by lower income from limited partnership investments. Dividend income in the first quarter of 2019 increased $219 million (29.1%) compared to the first quarter of 2018. The increase in dividend income was attributable to an overall increase in investment levels over the past year and higher dividend rates. We continue to hold large balances of cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance contracts or float. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $124 billion at March 31, 2019 and $123 billion at December 31, 2018. Our average cost of float was negative in the first quarter of 2019 as our underwriting operations generated pre-tax earnings of $487 million. 30 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations InsuranceInvestment Income (Continued) A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 follows (in millions). Cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills Equity securities Fixed maturity securities Fixed maturity securities as of March 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions). U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies States, municipalities and political subdivisions Foreign governments Corporate bonds, investment grade Corporate bonds, non-investment grade Mortgage-backed securities U.S. government securities are rated AA+ or Aaa by the major rating agencies. Approximately 88% of all state, municipal and political subdivisions, foreign government securities and mortgage-backed securities were rated AA or higher. Non-investment grade securities represent securities rated below BBB- or Baa3. Foreign government securities include obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by national or provincial government entities. Railroad (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (BNSF) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major business groups by type of product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products. A summary of BNSFs earnings follows (dollars in millions). Revenues Operating expenses: Compensation and benefits Fuel Purchased services Depreciation and amortization Equipment rents, materials and other Total operating expenses Interest expense Pre-tax earnings Income taxes Net earnings Effective income tax rate 31 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Railroad (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) (Continued) BNSFs revenues were approximately $5.8 billion in the first quarter of 2019, an increase of $138 million (2.5%) versus 2018. During the first quarter of 2019, BNSFs revenues reflected an 8.5% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit, driven by increased rates per car/unit and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Aggregate volumes in the first quarter of 2019 were approximately 2.5 million cars, a decrease of 5.4% from 2.6 million cars in the first quarter of 2018. Pre-tax earnings were approximately $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 10.0% compared to 2018. BNSF experienced severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network in the first quarter of 2019, which negatively affected revenues, expenses and service levels. BNSFs first quarter results also included a revenue increase related to the favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing and a reduction to expense for a curtailment gain arising from an amendment to a retirement plan. Revenues from consumer products were $2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2019, representing an increase of 7.6% compared to 2018. The increase reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume decreases of 5.7%. The volume decrease was attributable to lower international intermodal market share, increased truck competition, and the adverse weather conditions. Revenues from industrial products were $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 8.4% from 2018. The increase was attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit and a volume increase of 1.3%. Volumes in the first quarter of 2019 were higher primarily due to strength in the energy and industrial sectors, which drove higher demand for petroleum products, liquefied petroleum gas, and aggregates, partially offset by lower sand and taconite volumes as well as the aforementioned weather conditions. Revenues from agricultural products in the first quarter of 2019 were $1.1 billion, a decrease of 3.4% compared to 2018. The revenue decline reflected lower volumes of 7.4%, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to the weather conditions, partially offset by higher soybean exports. Revenues from coal in the first quarter of 2019 were $869 million, a decrease of 8.3% compared to 2018. This decrease reflected lower volumes of 10.3%, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decrease in the first quarter of 2019 was primarily attributable to the weather conditions, partially offset by higher market share. BNSFs operating expenses were $3.8 billion in the first quarter of 2019, a decrease of $26 million (0.7%) compared to 2018. The ratio of operating expenses to revenues in the first quarter of 2019 decreased 2.0 percentage points to 66.5% versus 2018. BNSFs expenses reflected lower volume-related costs and the aforementioned retirement plan curtailment gain, substantially offset by the impact of the adverse weather conditions. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $85 million (6.5%) compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to wage inflation and higher employee counts and related training costs. Fuel expenses decreased $56 million (7.3%) compared to 2018, primarily due to lower average fuel prices and lower fuel volumes, partially offset by unfavorable efficiency. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $96 million (18.8%) compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to the retirement plan curtailment gain, partially offset by higher personal injury expenses and casualty-related costs. Utilities and Energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company) We currently own 90.9% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (BHE), which operates a global energy business. BHEs domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (MEC) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (AltaLink, L.P.) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. In addition, BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. 32 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company) (Continued) The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. The legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) was enacted in December 2017, which reduced the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In 2018, BHEs regulated subsidiaries began passing the benefits of lower income tax expense attributable to the TCJA to customers through various regulatory mechanisms, including lower rates, higher depreciation and reductions to rate base. Revenues and earnings of BHE are summarized below (dollars in millions). PacifiCorp MidAmerican Energy Company NV Energy Northern Powergrid Natural gas pipelines Other energy businesses Real estate brokerage Corporate interest Pre-tax earnings Income tax benefit Net earnings Noncontrolling interests Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Effective income tax rate PacifiCorp PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. Revenues in the first quarter of 2019 were $1.3 billion, an increase of $79 million (7%) compared to the same period in 2018. Retail revenues in the first quarter of 2019 increased $95 million compared to 2018, reflecting a 4.3% increase in volumes largely attributable to weather and higher average rates ($39 million) due to lower net tax deferrals related to the TCJA and to business mix changes. Wholesale and other revenues decreased $20 million due to lower volumes and rates. Pre-tax earnings increased $49 million (28%) in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. Utility margin (operating revenues less cost of fuel and energy) in the first quarter of 2019 was $794 million, an increase of $43 million (6%) versus 2018. The increase in utility margin was due to the increase in revenues, partially offset by higher energy costs. PacifiCorps after-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2019 were $180 million, an increase of $32 million (22%) compared to 2018. MidAmerican Energy Company MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. Revenues in the first quarter of 2019 were $872 million, an increase of $105 million (14%) as compared to 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, electric operating revenues increased $73 million and natural gas revenues increased $20 million versus 2018. The increase in electric revenues was attributable to higher retail revenues ($55 million), reflecting increases in aggregate volumes and average rates from higher recoveries through bill riders, including a favorable ratemaking outcome in 2018 related to 2017 tax reform, and increased wholesale and other revenue ($18 million). The increase in natural gas revenues was primarily due to increased volumes. 33 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company) (Continued) MidAmerican Energy Company (Continued) Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2019 increased $44 million compared to the same period in 2018. Electric utility margin in the first quarter of 2019 was $428 million, an increase of $67 million compared to 2018. The increase in electric utility margin was partially offset by increased depreciation ($19 million) and maintenance and other operating expenses ($17 million). The depreciation increase reflected increases in new wind-powered generation and other plant additions. MECs after-tax earnings are greater than its pre-tax earnings due to the significant production tax credits related to its wind-powered generating facilities. MECs after-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2019 were $190 million, an increase of $87 million (84%) compared to 2018. NV Energy NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. Revenues in the first quarter of 2019 were $628 million, an increase of $3 million compared to 2018, reflecting increased other income partly offset by lower operating revenues. Natural gas operating revenue decreased $4 million in the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower rates, partially offset by higher customer usage. Retail electric operating revenues were relatively unchanged as lower rates resulting from rate reductions effective April 1, 2018 related to the TCJA were largely offset by higher retail customer volumes and wholesale revenue. Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2019 decreased $4 million (10%) compared to 2018. Electric utility margin in the first quarter of 2019 was $321 million, a decrease of $7 million compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower retail operating revenues. NV Energys after-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2019 were $29 million, a decrease of $4 million (12%) compared to 2018. Northern Powergrid Revenues decreased $12 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger average U.S. Dollar in 2019. Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2019 decreased $10 million (9%) compared to 2018, primarily due to lower revenues. Natural gas pipelines Revenues in the first quarter of 2019 declined $3 million (1%) compared to 2018. The decline was primarily due to lower transportation revenues of $19 million at Kern River (largely offset by lower depreciation) and lower gas sales volumes related to system balancing activities at Northern Natural Gas, which were largely offset in cost of sales, partially offset by higher transportation revenues at Northern Natural Gas of $20 million. Pre-tax earnings increased $19 million (9%) in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to the increase in transportation revenues at Northern Natural Gas, partly offset by a comparative increase in operating expenses. Other energy businesses Other energy revenues in the first quarter of 2019 declined $36 million (7%) compared to the same period in 2018. The decline included comparative decreases of 17% from renewable energy and a comparative decline of 7% at AltaLink, L.P. Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2019 decreased $27 million compared to the same period in 2018, which reflected increased pre-tax losses from tax equity renewable energy investments. The pre-tax losses from these investments were substantially offset by income tax benefits. After-tax earnings from other energy activities in the first quarter of 2019 were $104 million versus $110 million in 2018. Real estate brokerage Revenues in the first quarter of 2019 increased 3% as compared to the same period in 2018 due to recent business acquisitions, partially offset by an 11% decrease in closed units at existing brokerage businesses. Pre-tax losses increased $14 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to lower net revenues at existing brokerage businesses and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Corporate interest Corporate interest includes interest on unsecured debt issued by the BHE holding company. Corporate interest in the first three months of 2019 increased 4% as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher average borrowings. 34 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Utilities and Energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company) (Continued) Income taxes BHEs effective income tax rates for the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 were approximately (24.1%) and (34.3%), respectively. BHEs effective income tax rates regularly reflect significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation placed in service by our domestic regulated utilities and other energy businesses. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2019 increased primarily due to benefits recognized in 2018 related to foreign earnings and the accrued repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the TCJA, partially offset by an increase in recognized production tax credits and favorable impacts of rate making. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions). Manufacturing Service and retailing Pre-tax earnings Income taxes and noncontrolling interests Effective income tax rate Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which were primarily from the amortization of identified intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings in the preceding table were $192 million in 2019 and $218 million in 2018. These expenses are included in Other in the summary of earnings on page 25 and in the Other earnings section on page 39. Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of industrial, building and consumer products businesses. The industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (Lubrizol)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (PCC)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (IMC)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (CTB)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (LSPI)). Marmon includes UTLX Company (UTLX), which provides various products and services (including equipment leasing) for the rail and mobile crane industries. The building products group includes homebuilding and manufactured housing finance (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and the Duracell Company (Duracell), a manufacturer of high performance alkaline batteries. This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (dollars in millions). Industrial products Building products Consumer products 35 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Manufacturing (Continued) Aggregate revenues of our manufacturing businesses in the first quarter of 2019 were approximately $15.1 billion, an increase of $348 million (2.4%) compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2019 were approximately $2.2 billion, a decrease of $13 million (0.6%) from 2018. Industrial products Revenues of the industrial products group in the first quarter of 2019 were approximately $7.7 billion, an increase of $58 million (0.8%) versus 2018. Pre-tax earnings of the group were approximately $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2019, a decrease of $36 million (2.5%) compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues for the first quarter were 18.6% in 2019 and 19.3% in 2018. PCCs revenues in the first quarter of 2019 were approximately $2.6 billion, an increase of 3.1% over 2018. The increase reflected higher demand in aerospace markets in connection with new aircraft programs, partly offset by lower industrial gas turbine products sales and lower sales of certain pipe products, primarily attributable to U.S tariffs. PCCs pre-tax earnings increased 3.4% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. Results in 2019 reflected higher earnings from aerospace products, partially offset by lower earnings from industrial gas turbine business. While demand for aerospace products has been increasing, we have incurred incremental production and other costs to meet required deliveries to customers, which has negatively affected margins and earnings. However, we expect costs will decline as we increase production capacity where needed and further improve processes and reduce inefficiencies. Lubrizols revenues in the first quarter of 2019 were approximately $1.7 billion, a decrease of 3.6% compared to 2018. The decline was primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by higher average selling prices. Lubrizol continued to experience increases in average material unit costs, necessitating increases in sales prices. Lubrizols consolidated volume in the first quarter of 2019 declined 4% from 2018, reflecting reduced volumes in the Additives product lines, partially offset by volume increases in the Advanced Materials product lines. Lubrizols pre-tax earnings decreased 5.2% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. Results in the first quarter of 2019 were negatively affected by the reduction in sales volume, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, increased operating expenses and raw materials costs. Marmons revenues in the first quarter of 2019 were approximately $2.0 billion, an increase of 1.2% as compared to 2018. First quarter revenues were higher in the Transportation Products (heavy-duty trucks and trailers), Retail Solutions and Crane Services sectors, partially offset by decreases across the other sectors. The comparative first quarter revenue declines were primarily in the Food & Beverage Equipment and Plumbing & Refrigeration sectors, which included the effects of a 2018 divestiture of a beverage equipment parts business, lower metals prices and volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S Dollar. Marmons pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2019 decreased 3.1% compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of sales fell to 14.9% in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 15.5% in 2018. Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2019 of the Rail Products & Leasing sector declined $10 million, which was attributable to lower average railcar lease rates. In addition, we experienced lower earnings from sales volume declines in the Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration sectors, and depressed margins in the Retail Solutions and Industrial Products sectors, with the latter negatively affected by U.S. tariffs. These earnings declines were partially offset by increased earnings in the Transportation Products and Electrical Products sectors and from the effects of 2018 business acquisitions. IMCs revenues in the first quarter of 2019 were relatively unchanged from the first quarter of 2018, reflecting increased revenues from recent business acquisitions, offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects from a stronger U.S. Dollar. IMCs pre-tax earnings declined in the first quarter of 2019 versus 2018, reflecting increased average raw material costs, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and changes in business mix. CTBs revenues increased 3.9% in the first quarter of 2019 versus 2018, primarily due to increased revenues from grain systems and processing equipment, partially offset by lower protein production revenues and the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar. CTBs pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2019 increased 16.3% versus 2018, primarily due to the increase in revenues, moderation of average costs of certain raw materials, pricing efficiency and ongoing efforts to control operating expenses. 36 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing ( Continued) Building products Revenues of the building products group in the first quarter of 2019 were approximately $4.6 billion, an increase of $482 million (11.8%) compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings of the group in the first quarter of 2019 were $482 million, an increase of 7.8% versus 2018. Pre-tax earnings represented 10.6% and 11.0% of revenues in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Clayton Homes produced revenues of $1,554 million in the first quarter of 2019, an increase of $307 million (25%) over 2018. The comparative increase was primarily due to increased home sales of $281 million (33%) and increased interest income from lending activities. The sales increase reflected changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site built homes in the first quarter of 2019 increased 157% over 2018, primarily due to business acquisitions completed during 2018, while manufactured homes sold at retail and wholesale declined 10%. The increase in income from lending activities was primarily due to increased average outstanding loan balances. As of March 31, 2019, aggregate loan balances outstanding were approximately $14.8 billion, compared to $13.8 billion as of March 31, 2018. Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes for the first quarter of 2019 were $216 million, an increase of $21 million (11%) compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to home building activities, which reflected the increase in home sales. A significant part of Clayton Homes earnings derives from manufactured housing lending activities. Pre-tax earnings from lending activities in 2019 were relatively unchanged compared to 2018, as the increase in income from lending activities was substantially offset by higher interest expense, attributable to higher average outstanding debt and interest rates and to higher operating costs. In the first quarter of 2019, our other building products businesses generated a comparative increase in revenues of 6%, primarily attributable to higher hard surface flooring products and roofing systems volumes, partly offset by lower carpet volumes. Additionally, average selling prices of these businesses were generally higher in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 2018, which were in response to rising raw material and other production costs over the past year. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses in the first quarter of 2019 were $266 million, an increase of 6% over 2018. The ratio of pre-tax earnings to revenues was relatively unchanged from the first quarter of 2018. As previously noted, rising raw material and production cost increases prevailed over the past year. In particular, the cost increases for steel, titanium dioxide, and certain petrochemicals were significant. In the first quarter of 2019, these cost increases moderated. Consumer products Consumer products revenues were approximately $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2019, a decrease of $192 million (6.4%) versus 2018. The first quarter revenue decline was primarily attributable to decreases at Forest River and Duracell, partly offset by higher revenues from apparel and footwear businesses. First quarter 2019 revenues of Forest River declined 16% versus 2018, reflecting an 18% decline in unit sales. Revenues of Duracell declined 6% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year period due to lower sales in foreign markets and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation. Apparel and footwear revenues in the first quarter of 2019 increased 6%, due primarily to increases of Brooks Sports footwear (22%) and the apparel group (5%). Consumer products pre-tax earnings were $281 million in the first quarter of 2019, a decrease of $12 million (4.1%) compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 9.9% in 2019 and 9.7% in 2018. The decrease in pre-tax earnings reflected a 24% comparative decline at Forest River, partly offset by comparative earnings increases from Brooks Sports, the apparel businesses and Richline. Service and retailing A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (in millions). Service Retailing McLane Company 37 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) Service Our service business group offers fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI) and franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), publication of newspapers and other publications (Buffalo News and the BH Media Group) and operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). We also offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Revenues of the service group in the first quarter of 2019 were approximately $3.4 billion, an increase of $245 million (7.7%) as compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to TTI and NetJets. First quarter 2019 revenues of TTI increased 15% compared to 2018, reflecting industry-wide increased demand for electronic components in many geographic markets around the world that began in 2017, and from the effects of business acquisitions, partly offset by foreign currency translation effects of a stronger average U.S. Dollar. We believe the strong growth in electronic components demand experienced recently is beginning to moderate. NetJets revenue increased 5% in the first quarter of 2019, due to increases in the number of aircraft on lease and in flight hours. Pre-tax earnings of the service group in the first quarter of 2019 were $472 million, an increase of $57 million (13.7%) compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings of the group were 13.8% of first quarter revenues in 2019 compared to 13.1% in 2018. The increase in comparative first quarter earnings was primarily attributable to TTI and NetJets. Retailing Our retailers include Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (BHA). BHA includes over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles, and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordans), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), Sees Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (Louis), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories. Revenues of the retailing group in the first quarter of 2019 were approximately $3.6 billion, a decrease of $35 million (1.0%) compared to 2018. BHAs revenues, which represented approximately 65% of our aggregate retailing revenues, increased 1.3% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily from a 7% increase in pre-owned vehicle sales and higher revenues from finance and service contract activities, partly offset by a 4% reduction in new auto sales. Revenues of Sees Candies and Oriental Trading declined 19% and 11%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018, primarily attributable to the seasonal effects of the timing of the Easter holiday. Revenues of our home furnishings businesses declined 4% in the first quarter of 2019 versus 2018 attributable to slowing consumer demand and unfavorable weather in certain regions. Pre-tax earnings of the retailing group in the first quarter of 2019 were $149 million, a decrease of $9 million (5.7%) from 2018. Our home furnishings retailers experienced a 42% decline in comparative first quarter earnings, reflecting lower revenues and generally higher operating expenses. Pre-tax earnings of Sees Candies and Oriental Trading also declined in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018, attributable to the lower revenues previously noted. These earnings declines were partly offset by increased earnings of BHA, due to increased earnings from finance and service contract activities, partly offset by higher floorplan interest expense. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (grocery) and to restaurants (foodservice). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (beverage). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprise approximately two-thirds of McLanes consolidated sales with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. Revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $12.2 billion, relatively unchanged from the first quarter of 2018, reflecting a 1.5% decrease in grocery sales and a 2.7% increase in foodservice sales. Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2019 were $111 million, an increase of $51 million (85%) compared to 2018. The comparative improvement in first quarter earnings was primarily due to the effects of lower LIFO inventory valuation allowances from lower inventory levels and gains from increased prices related to certain inventory items. Otherwise, pretax-earnings in the first quarter of 2019 were substantially unchanged from 2018. McLane continues to operate in an intensely competitive business environment, which is negatively affecting its current operating results and contributing to low operating margin rates. We expect these unfavorable operating conditions will continue in 2019. 38 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains/losses follows (dollars in millions). Investment gains (losses) Derivative gains (losses) Gains (losses) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests Income taxes and noncontrolling interests Net gains (losses) Effective income tax rate Investment gains/losses Due to a new accounting pronouncement adopted as of January 1, 2018, pre-tax investment gains/losses reported in earnings in the first quarter included net unrealized gains of approximately $19.4 billion in 2019 and net unrealized losses of approximately $7.8 billion in 2018 from our investments in equity securities still held the end of each period. Prior to 2018, investment gains/losses on equity securities were recorded when the securities were sold based on the cost of the disposed securities. While the new accounting standard does not change the affect on our consolidated shareholders equity or total comprehensive income, it has significantly increased the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Investment gains/losses from periodic changes in securities prices will continue to cause significant volatility in our consolidated earnings. We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings, including the changes in market prices for equity securities in any given period, has little analytical or predictive value. Derivative gains/losses Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities. These liabilities relate to contracts entered into before March 2008. Substantially all of these contracts will expire between April 2019 and February 2023. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying equity markets and the changes in the inputs used to measure such liabilities. As of March 31, 2019, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was approximately $1.0 billion and our recorded liabilities at fair value were approximately $1.7 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. Contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately $12.2 billion will expire over the remainder of 2019. Derivative contracts produced pre-tax gains of $770 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to pre-tax losses of $206 million in 2018. The gains in 2019 were primarily due to higher equity index values, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and shorter average contract durations. Other A summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). Equity method earnings Acquisition accounting expenses Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects Corporate interest expense, Euro note foreign exchange rate effects Income tax expense adjustment Other Net earnings (losses) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders 39 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Other ( Continued ) After-tax equity method earnings include Berkshires share of earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz, Pilot Flying J, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. As discussed in Note 5 to the accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements, financial statements of Kraft Heinz for the first quarter of 2019 were not made available to us. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements do not include our share of Kraft Heinzs earnings for that period. After-tax equity method earnings from Kraft Heniz were $234 million in the first quarter of 2018. We will include our share of Kraft Heinzs first quarter 2019 earnings in our earnings in the period such information is made available to Berkshire. After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshires past business acquisitions. Such charges were primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. The aggregate par amount of Berkshires outstanding Euro denominated debt was 6.85 billion during the first quarter of 2019 and 2018. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced non-cash unrealized gains in the first quarter of 2019 and losses in the first quarter of 2018 from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The income tax expense adjustment relates to investments that we made between 2015 and 2018 in certain tax equity investment funds. Our investments in these funds aggregated approximately $340 million. In December 2018 and during the first quarter of 2019, we learned of allegations by federal authorities of fraudulent income conduct by the sponsor of these funds. As a result of our investigation into these allegations, we now believe that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefits that we recognized are not valid. Financial Condition Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders equity at March 31, 2019 was approximately $369 billion, an increase of $20.2 billion since December 31, 2018. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in the first quarter of 2019 were $21.7 billion, which included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $15.5 billion, which was primarily due to increases during the first quarter in market prices of the equity securities we owned at March 31, 2019. At March 31, 2019, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of approximately $110.5 billion, which included $89.9 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were approximately $211.2 billion. Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at March 31, 2019 was approximately $16.7 billion, a decrease of $167 million since December 31, 2018, which was attributable to foreign currency exchange rate changes applicable to the 6.85 billion par amount of Euro denominated senior notes. Berkshire parent company debt of $750 million matures in August 2019. Berkshires insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings declined approximately $1 billion in the first quarter of 2019 to approximately $17.1 billion at March 31, 2019, primarily attributable to a net decrease in borrowings of Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC), a wholly-owned financing subsidiary. BHFCs senior note borrowings are used to fund loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and a portion of assets held for lease by our UTLX railcar leasing business. In the first quarter of 2019, BHFC repaid $2.7 billion of maturing senior notes and issued $2.0 billion of 4.25% senior notes due in 2049. An additional $1.25 billion of BHFC senior notes will mature in August 2019. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFCs senior notes. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of these two operations in the first quarter of 2019 were $2.0 billion and we forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $9.0 billion over the remainder of 2019. BNSFs outstanding debt approximated $23.2 billion as of March 31, 2019, which was substantially unchanged since December 31, 2018. BNSF debentures of $750 million will mature in 2019. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were approximately $40.1 billion at March 31, 2019, an increase of $840 million since December 31, 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, BHE and its subsidiaries issued debt aggregating $3.0 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2029 to 2050 and repaid approximately $1.4 billion of maturing term debt. The proceeds from these financings were used to repay borrowings, to fund capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes. BHE subsidiary term debt of $666 million will mature over the remainder of 2019. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. 40 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition (Continued) Berkshires common stock repurchase program was amended on July 17, 2018, permitting Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshires intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshires Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshires consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In the first quarter of 2019, Berkshire repurchased shares of Class A and B common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $1.7 billion. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future are not currently reflected in the financial statements, and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. Beginning in 2019, operating lease obligations are included in the consolidated balance sheet as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2019 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in the Contractual Obligations section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Berkshires Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to Critical Accounting Policies discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Berkshires Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2019 includes estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts of approximately $111 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing loss reserve amounts, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude will result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2019 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately $81 billion. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2018. Although we believe that the goodwill reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is not impaired, goodwill may subsequently become impaired due to changes in facts and circumstances affecting the valuation of the reporting unit. A goodwill impairment charge could have a material effect on periodic earnings. Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, estimates or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Reference is made to Berkshires most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the Market Risk Disclosures included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. As of March 31, 2019, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshires Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Companys periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. 42 Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 to which reference is made herein. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities For several years, Berkshire had a common stock repurchase program, which permitted Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. On July 17, 2018, Berkshires Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the program, permitting Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshires Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshires intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshires Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the first quarter of 2019 follows. Period February 26 through February 28: Class A common stock Class B common stock March 1 through March 29: Class A common stock Class B common stock The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshires consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $20 billion.

Contents UnitedHealth Group Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 as filed with the SEC (2022 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. Use of Estimates These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues - Products and Services As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, accounts receivable related to products and services were $ 8.0 billion and $ 7.1 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, was $ 11.8 billion, of which approximately half is expected to be recognized in the next three years . 7 Table of Contents 2.

The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments, venture investments and shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.5 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was not material. 8 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of September 30, 2023, by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 5,372 $ 5,340 $ 375 $ 372 Due after one year through five years 15,098 14,183 262 255 Due after five years through ten years 11,256 9,898 25 24 Due after ten years 5,219 4,690 20 16 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 8,632 7,474 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,091 2,767 — — Total debt securities $ 48,668 $ 44,352 $ 682 $ 667 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses September 30, 2023 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 2,023 $ ( 34 ) $ 2,081 $ ( 306 ) $ 4,104 $ ( 340 ) State and municipal obligations 2,872 ( 124 ) 4,042 ( 519 ) 6,914 ( 643 ) Corporate obligations 5,563 ( 149 ) 14,821 ( 1,708 ) 20,384 ( 1,857 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,562 ( 140 ) 4,867 ( 1,018 ) 7,429 ( 1,158 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 480 ( 21 ) 2,249 ( 303 ) 2,729 ( 324 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 13,500 $ ( 468 ) $ 28,060 $ ( 3,854 ) $ 41,560 $ ( 4,322 ) December 31, 2022 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 2,007 $ ( 96 ) $ 1,290 $ ( 189 ) $ 3,297 $ ( 285 ) State and municipal obligations 4,630 ( 288 ) 1,178 ( 191 ) 5,808 ( 479 ) Corporate obligations 13,003 ( 893 ) 6,637 ( 905 ) 19,640 ( 1,798 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,561 ( 345 ) 2,239 ( 463 ) 5,800 ( 808 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,698 ( 128 ) 976 ( 166 ) 2,674 ( 294 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 24,899 $ ( 1,750 ) $ 12,320 $ ( 1,914 ) $ 37,219 $ ( 3,664 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of September 30, 2023 were generated from approximately 37,000 positions out of a total of 41,000 positions. The Company believes that it will timely collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company’s assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of September 30, 2023, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was not material. 9 Table of Contents 3. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2022 10-K. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value September 30, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents $ 38,880 $ 35 $ — $ 38,915 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 5,050 349 — 5,399 State and municipal obligations — 7,053 — 7,053 Corporate obligations 15 21,462 182 21,659 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 7,474 — 7,474 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,767 — 2,767 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 5,065 39,105 182 44,352 Equity securities 2,231 31 70 2,332 Assets under management 1,420 2,094 102 3,616 Total assets at fair value $ 47,596 $ 41,265 $ 354 $ 89,215 Percentage of total assets at fair value 53 % 46 % 1 % 100 % December 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 23,202 $ 163 $ — $ 23,365 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,505 304 — 3,809 State and municipal obligations — 7,248 — 7,248 Corporate obligations 7 21,695 192 21,894 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 6,586 — 6,586 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,784 — 2,784 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,512 38,617 192 42,321 Equity securities 2,043 35 70 2,148 Assets under management 1,788 2,203 96 4,087 Total assets at fair value $ 30,545 $ 41,018 $ 358 $ 71,921 Percentage of total assets at fair value 42 % 57 % 1 % 100 % There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 or 2022. 10 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value September 30, 2023 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 593 $ 74 $ — $ 667 $ 682 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 55,137 $ — $ 55,137 $ 60,769 December 31, 2022 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 577 $ 102 $ — $ 679 $ 696 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 53,626 $ — $ 53,626 $ 56,823 Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 or 2022. 4. Medical Costs Payable The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the nine months ended September 30: (in millions) 2023 2022 Medical costs payable, beginning of period $ 29,056 $ 24,483 Acquisitions 1 177 Reported medical costs: Current year 180,423 157,601 Prior years ( 760 ) ( 350 ) Total reported medical costs 179,663 157,251 Medical payments: Payments for current year ( 149,671 ) ( 130,788 ) Payments for prior years ( 26,257 ) ( 22,059 ) Total medical payments ( 175,928 ) ( 152,847 ) Medical costs payable, end of period $ 32,792 $ 29,064 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, prior years’ medical cost reserve development included no individual factors that were significant. Medical costs payable included reserves for claims incurred by consumers but not yet reported to the Company of $ 22.7 billion and $ 20.0 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 5. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt In March 2023, the Company issued $ 6.5 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of the following: (in millions, except percentages) Par Value 4.250 % notes due January 2029 $ 1,250 4.500 % notes due April 2033 1,500 5.050 % notes due April 2053 2,000 5.200 % notes due April 2063 1,750 As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $ 2.6 billion of commercial paper outstanding, with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 5.3 %. For more information on the Company’s short-term borrowings, debt covenants and long-term debt, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2022 10-K. 11 Table of Contents 6. Dividends In June 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $7.52 compared to $6.60 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2022. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The following table provides details of the Company’s dividend payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2023: Payment Date Amount per Share Total Amount Paid (in millions) March 21 $ 1.65 $ 1,537 June 27 1.88 1,747 September 19 1.88 1,739 7. Commitments and Contingencies Pending Acquisitions As of September 30, 2023, the Company has entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated consideration required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $ 5 billion. Legal Matters The Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, the Company’s international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, the DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome which may result from this matter given its procedural status. 12 Table of Contents 8. Business Combinations During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company completed several business combinations for total consideration of $ 8.4 billion. Acquired assets (liabilities) at acquisition date were: (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 104 Accounts receivable and other current assets 587 Property, equipment and other long-term assets 573 Other intangible assets 1,800 Total identifiable assets acquired 3,064 Medical costs payable ( 1 ) Accounts payable and other current liabilities ( 551 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 661 ) Total identifiable liabilities acquired ( 1,213 ) Total net identifiable assets 1,851 Goodwill 8,073 Redeemable noncontrolling interests ( 121 ) Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests ( 1,339 ) Net assets acquired $ 8,464 The majority of goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The preliminary purchase price allocations for the various business combinations are subject to adjustment as valuation analyses, primarily related to intangible assets and contingent liabilities, are finalized. The acquisition date fair values and weighted-average useful lives assigned to intangible assets were: (in millions, except years) Fair Value Weighted-Average Useful Life Acquired finite-lived intangible assets: Customer-related $ 223 12 years Trademarks and technology 171 5 years Other 42 6 years Total acquired finite-lived intangible assets 436 9 years Total acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets - operating licenses and certificates 1,364 Total acquired intangible assets $ 1,800 The results of operations and financial condition of acquired entities have been included in the Company’s consolidated results and the results of the corresponding operating segment as of the date of acquisition. Through September 30, 2023, acquired entities’ impact on revenues and net earnings was not material. Unaudited pro forma revenues and net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, as if the business combinations had occurred on January 1, 2022, were immaterial for both periods. 13 Table of Contents 9. Segment Financial Information The Company’s four reportable segments are UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx.

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2022 10-K and in the discussion below. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. We have four reportable segments: • Optum Health; • Optum Insight; • Optum Rx; and • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2022 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 9 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of expected future costs, including medical cost trends, inflation and labor market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. Government programs in the community and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. 16 Table of Contents Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, care activity and prescription drug costs. During the third quarter we continued to observe increased care patterns, primarily related to outpatient procedures for seniors, consistent with the levels observed in the second quarter, and which may continue in future periods. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve quality, affordable care. Medicaid Redeterminations. The majority of states have resumed Medicaid redeterminations, which have impacted the number of people served through our Medicaid offerings, partially offset by an increase in consumers served through our commercial offerings as we endeavor to ensure that people and families have continued access to benefits. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Medicare Advantage Rates. Medicare Advantage rate notices over the years have at times resulted in industry base rates well below industry forward medical trend. For example, the Final Notice for 2024 rates resulted in an industry base rate decrease, well short of what is an increasing industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Further, substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient’s health status and care resource needs, will result in reduced funding and potentially benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges. As a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.

Revenues also increased due to increased investment income, primarily driven by increased interest rates. Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased primarily due to growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. The MCR increased as a result of elevated care activity, primarily relating to outpatient care for seniors, and business mix. Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio increased primarily due to business mix and investments to support future growth, partially offset by continued productivity advances. 18 Table of Contents Reportable Segments See Note 9 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including people served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the level and scope of services provided to people, and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment.

Earnings from operations increased due to increased investment income and the factors impacting revenue, partially offset by elevated care activity, primarily relating to outpatient care for seniors. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows: Optum Health Revenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in patients served under value-based care arrangements and business combinations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, earnings from operations increased, while remaining consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to cost management initiatives and increased investment income, offset by higher senior outpatient and behavioral health care activity, costs associated with serving newly added patients under value-based care arrangements and decreased asset dispositions. Optum Health served approximately 103 million people as of September 30, 2023 compared to 101 million people as of September 30, 2022. Optum Insight Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Insight increased due to growth in business services as a result of business combinations and growth in technology services. Optum Rx Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to growth in pharmacy offerings and higher script volumes from both new clients and growth in existing clients. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain and operating cost management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 383 million and 359 million adjusted scripts in the third quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. 20 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 34,261 $ 30,739 $ 3,522 Issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net of repayments 5,848 3,806 2,042 Proceeds from common stock issuances 1,039 1,084 (45) Customer funds administered 2,037 7,028 (4,991) Other — 50 (50) Total sources of cash 43,185 42,707 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (6,500) (6,000) (500) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (8,389) (7,154) (1,235) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (2,850) (4,067) 1,217 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (2,427) (1,936) (491) Cash dividends paid (5,023) (4,450) (573) Other (2,495) (1,634) (861) Total uses of cash (27,684) (25,241) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 49 4 45 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 15,550 $ 17,470 $ (1,920) 2023 Cash Flows Compared to 2022 Cash Flows Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by increased net earnings and the receipt of our October CMS premium payment of $11.9 billion and $9.8 billion in September 2023 and 2022, respectively. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt and decreased net purchases of investments, partially offset by decreased customer funds administered, primarily driven by Medicare Part D timing, and increased cash paid for acquisitions. Financial Condition As of September 30, 2023, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $87.5 billion included approximately $38.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.5 billion was available for general corporate use), $44.4 billion of debt securities and $4.2 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.8 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of September 30, 2023. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Cash Requirements. A summary of our cash requirements as of December 31, 2022 was disclosed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2022 10-K. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs. We continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and business combinations. 21 Table of Contents Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2022 10-K. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of September 30, 2023, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 38%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2022 10-K. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of September 30, 2023 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A2 Stable A+ Stable A Stable A Stable Commercial paper P-1 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1+ n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased approximately 13 million shares at an average price of $485.10 per share. As of September 30, 2023, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to 18 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In June 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $7.52 compared to $6.60 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Pending Acquisitions. As of September 30, 2023, we have entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated consideration required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $5 billion. For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 in our 2022 10-K. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS There are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 in our 2022 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2022 10-K. 22 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities law. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; cyberattacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; risks and uncertainties associated with our businesses providing pharmacy care services; competitive pressures, including our ability to maintain or increase our market share; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers; the impact of potential changes in tax laws and regulations; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to complete, manage or integrate strategic transactions; risks associated with public health crises arising from large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, natural disasters and other extreme events; failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; failure to protect proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products; downgrades in our credit ratings; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of September 30, 2023 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): September 30, 2023 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 971 $ 419 $ (3,408) $ (7,067) 1 486 209 (1,758) (3,846) (1) (486) (193) 1,858 4,635 (2) (971) (386) 3,800 10,274 Note: The impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates may not reflect the full 100 or 200 basis point change on interest income and interest expense or on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities as the rates are assumed to not fall below zero. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2023. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2023.

Group Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 as filed with the SEC (2022 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. Use of Estimates These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues - Products and Services As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, accounts receivable related to products and services were $ 7.7 billion and $ 7.1 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, was $ 12.2 billion, of which approximately half is expected to be recognized in the next three years . 7 Table of Contents 2.

The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments, venture investments and shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.5 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was not material. 8 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of June 30, 2023, by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 4,646 $ 4,613 $ 466 $ 461 Due after one year through five years 14,748 13,935 225 219 Due after five years through ten years 11,332 10,206 31 30 Due after ten years 5,180 4,820 18 16 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 8,504 7,710 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,148 2,844 — — Total debt securities $ 47,558 $ 44,128 $ 740 $ 726 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses June 30, 2023 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 2,300 $ ( 28 ) $ 1,902 $ ( 255 ) $ 4,202 $ ( 283 ) State and municipal obligations 2,769 ( 46 ) 3,324 ( 381 ) 6,093 ( 427 ) Corporate obligations 6,346 ( 122 ) 13,974 ( 1,521 ) 20,320 ( 1,643 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,111 ( 79 ) 4,314 ( 720 ) 7,425 ( 799 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 577 ( 15 ) 2,239 ( 289 ) 2,816 ( 304 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 15,103 $ ( 290 ) $ 25,753 $ ( 3,166 ) $ 40,856 $ ( 3,456 ) December 31, 2022 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 2,007 $ ( 96 ) $ 1,290 $ ( 189 ) $ 3,297 $ ( 285 ) State and municipal obligations 4,630 ( 288 ) 1,178 ( 191 ) 5,808 ( 479 ) Corporate obligations 13,003 ( 893 ) 6,637 ( 905 ) 19,640 ( 1,798 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,561 ( 345 ) 2,239 ( 463 ) 5,800 ( 808 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,698 ( 128 ) 976 ( 166 ) 2,674 ( 294 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 24,899 $ ( 1,750 ) $ 12,320 $ ( 1,914 ) $ 37,219 $ ( 3,664 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of June 30, 2023 were generated from approximately 35,000 positions out of a total of 41,000 positions. The Company believes that it will timely collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company’s assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of June 30, 2023, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was not material. 9 Table of Contents 3. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2022 10-K. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value June 30, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents $ 41,763 $ 50 $ — $ 41,813 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 4,318 389 — 4,707 State and municipal obligations — 6,917 — 6,917 Corporate obligations 36 21,732 182 21,950 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 7,710 — 7,710 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,844 — 2,844 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 4,354 39,592 182 44,128 Equity securities 2,270 37 70 2,377 Assets under management 1,332 2,190 101 3,623 Total assets at fair value $ 49,719 $ 41,869 $ 353 $ 91,941 Percentage of total assets at fair value 54 % 45 % 1 % 100 % December 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 23,202 $ 163 $ — $ 23,365 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,505 304 — 3,809 State and municipal obligations — 7,248 — 7,248 Corporate obligations 7 21,695 192 21,894 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 6,586 — 6,586 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,784 — 2,784 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,512 38,617 192 42,321 Equity securities 2,043 35 70 2,148 Assets under management 1,788 2,203 96 4,087 Total assets at fair value $ 30,545 $ 41,018 $ 358 $ 71,921 Percentage of total assets at fair value 42 % 57 % 1 % 100 % There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 or 2022. 10 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value June 30, 2023 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 651 $ 75 $ — $ 726 $ 740 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 58,644 $ — $ 58,644 $ 61,217 December 31, 2022 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 577 $ 102 $ — $ 679 $ 696 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 53,626 $ — $ 53,626 $ 56,823 Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2023 or 2022. 4. Medical Costs Payable The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the six months ended June 30: (in millions) 2023 2022 Medical costs payable, beginning of period $ 29,056 $ 24,483 Acquisitions 1 171 Reported medical costs: Current year 120,773 104,936 Prior years ( 660 ) ( 320 ) Total reported medical costs 120,113 104,616 Medical payments: Payments for current year ( 91,621 ) ( 78,937 ) Payments for prior years ( 25,602 ) ( 21,355 ) Total medical payments ( 117,223 ) ( 100,292 ) Medical costs payable, end of period $ 31,947 $ 28,978 For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, prior years’ medical cost reserve development included no individual factors that were significant. Medical costs payable included reserves for claims incurred by insured customers but not yet reported to the Company of $ 22.0 billion and $ 20.0 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 5. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt In March 2023, the Company issued $ 6.5 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of the following: (in millions, except percentages) Par Value 4.250 % notes due January 2029 $ 1,250 4.500 % notes due April 2033 1,500 5.050 % notes due April 2053 2,000 5.200 % notes due April 2063 1,750 As of June 30, 2023, the Company had $ 4.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding, with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 5.1 %. For more information on the Company’s short-term borrowings, debt covenants and long-term debt, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2022 10-K. 11 Table of Contents 6. Dividends In June 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $7.52 compared to $6.60 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2022. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The following table provides details of the Company’s dividend payments during the six months ended June 30, 2023: Payment Date Amount per Share Total Amount Paid (in millions) March 21 $ 1.65 $ 1,537 June 27 1.88 1,747 7. Commitments and Contingencies Pending Acquisitions As of June 30, 2023, the Company has entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated consideration required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $ 5 billion. Legal Matters The Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, the DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome which may result from this matter given its procedural status. 12 Table of Contents 8. Business Combinations During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company completed several business combinations for total consideration of $ 8.2 billion. Acquired assets (liabilities) at acquisition date were: (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 104 Accounts receivable and other current assets 550 Property, equipment and other long-term assets 542 Other intangible assets 1,795 Total identifiable assets acquired 2,991 Medical costs payable ( 1 ) Accounts payable and other current liabilities ( 473 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 617 ) Total identifiable liabilities acquired ( 1,091 ) Total net identifiable assets 1,900 Goodwill 7,734 Redeemable noncontrolling interests ( 113 ) Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests ( 1,297 ) Net assets acquired $ 8,224 The majority of goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The preliminary purchase price allocations for the various business combinations are subject to adjustment as valuation analyses, primarily related to intangible assets and contingent liabilities, are finalized. The acquisition date fair values and weighted-average useful lives assigned to intangible assets were: (in millions, except years) Fair Value Weighted-Average Useful Life Acquired finite-lived intangible assets: Customer-related $ 223 12 years Trademarks and technology 171 5 years Other 38 6 years Total acquired finite-lived intangible assets 432 9 years Total acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets - operating licenses and certificates 1,363 Total acquired intangible assets $ 1,795 The results of operations and financial condition of acquired entities have been included in the Company’s consolidated results and the results of the corresponding operating segment as of the date of acquisition. Through June 30, 2023, acquired entities impact on revenues and net earnings was not material. Unaudited pro forma revenues and net earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, as if the business combinations had occurred on January 1, 2022, were immaterial for both periods. 13 Table of Contents 9.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and with our 2022 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in that report. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the terms “UnitedHealth Group,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 2, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2022 10-K and in the discussion below. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. We have four reportable segments: • Optum Health; • Optum Insight; • Optum Rx; and • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2022 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 9 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of expected future costs, including medical cost trends, inflation and labor market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. Government programs in the community and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. 16 Table of Contents Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, care activity and prescription drug costs. During the second quarter, we observed increased care patterns, primarily related to outpatient procedures for seniors, which may continue in future periods. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve quality, affordable care. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Medicare Advantage Rates. Medicare Advantage rate notices over the years have at times resulted in industry base rates well below industry forward medical trend. For example, the Final Notice for 2024 rates resulted in an industry base rate decrease, well short of what is an increasing industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Further, substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient’s health status and care resource needs, will result in reduced funding and potentially benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges. As a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.

Revenues also increased due to increased investment income, primarily driven by increased interest rates. Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased primarily due to growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. The MCR increased as a result of elevated care activity, primarily relating to outpatient care for seniors, and business mix. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, the MCR also increased due to decreased favorable reserve development. Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio increased primarily due to business mix and investments to support future growth, partially offset by continued productivity advances. Reportable Segments See Note 9 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including people served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the level and scope of services provided to people, and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment. The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: Three Months Ended June 30, Increase/ (Decrease) Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022 2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022 Revenues UnitedHealthcare $ 70,231 $ 62,105 $ 8,126 13 % $ 140,699 $ 124,700 $ 15,999 13 % Optum Health 23,917 17,583 6,334 36 46,921 34,265 12,656 37 Optum Insight 4,674 3,282 1,392 42 9,170 6,501 2,669 41 Optum Rx 28,646 24,805 3,841 15 56,064 48,716 7,348 15 Optum eliminations (893) (588) (305) 52 (1,752) (1,141) (611) 54 Optum 56,344 45,082 11,262 25 110,403 88,341 22,062 25 Eliminations (33,672) (26,855) (6,817) 25 (66,268) (52,560) (13,708) 26 Consolidated revenues $ 92,903 $ 80,332 $ 12,571 16 % $ 184,834 $ 160,481 $ 24,353 15 % Earnings from operations UnitedHealthcare $ 4,358 $ 3,850 $ 508 13 % $ 8,701 $ 7,648 $ 1,053 14 % Optum Health 1,525 1,399 126 9 3,301 2,765 536 19 Optum Insight 968 839 129 15 1,875 1,686 189 11 Optum Rx 1,206 1,044 162 16 2,266 1,983 283 14 Optum 3,699 3,282 417 13 7,442 6,434 1,008 16 Consolidated earnings from operations $ 8,057 $ 7,132 $ 925 13 % $ 16,143 $ 14,082 $ 2,061 15 % Operating margin UnitedHealthcare 6.2 % 6.2 % — % 6.2 % 6.1 % 0.1 % Optum Health 6.4 8.0 (1.6) 7.0 8.1 (1.1) Optum Insight 20.7 25.6 (4.9) 20.4 25.9 (5.5) Optum Rx 4.2 4.2 — 4.0 4.1 (0.1) Optum 6.6 7.3 (0.7) 6.7 7.3 (0.6) Consolidated operating margin 8.7 % 8.9 % (0.2) % 8.7 % 8.8 % (0.1) % 19 Table of Contents UnitedHealthcare The following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: Three Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022 2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Domestic $ 16,759 $ 15,567 $ 1,192 8 % $ 33,303 $ 31,389 $ 1,914 6 % UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Global 2,325 2,247 78 3 4,488 4,380 108 2 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Total 19,084 17,814 1,270 7 37,791 35,769 2,022 6 UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement 32,440 28,625 3,815 13 65,446 57,725 7,721 13 UnitedHealthcare Community & State 18,707 15,666 3,041 19 37,462 31,206 6,256 20 Total UnitedHealthcare revenues $ 70,231 $ 62,105 $ 8,126 13 % $ 140,699 $ 124,700 $ 15,999 13 % The following table summarizes the number of people served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: June 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in thousands, except percentages) 2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022 Commercial - Domestic: Risk-based 8,035 8,010 25 — % Fee-based 19,140 18,480 660 4 Total Commercial - Domestic 27,175 26,490 685 3 Medicare Advantage 7,590 6,945 645 9 Medicaid 8,355 7,990 365 5 Medicare Supplement (Standardized) 4,330 4,355 (25) (1) Total Community and Senior 20,275 19,290 985 5 Total UnitedHealthcare - Domestic Medical 47,450 45,780 1,670 4 Commercial - Global 5,385 5,465 (80) (1) Total UnitedHealthcare - Medical 52,835 51,245 1,590 3 % Supplemental Data: Medicare Part D stand-alone 3,355 3,330 25 1 % UnitedHealthcare’s revenues increased due to growth in the number of people served through individual and group Medicare Advantage plans; growth in existing Medicaid markets, including a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs; and an increase in the number of people served through commercial offerings. Earnings from operations increased due to increased investment income and the factors impacting revenue, partially offset by elevated care activity, primarily relating to outpatient care for seniors. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows: Optum Health Revenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in patients served under value-based care arrangements and business combinations. Earnings from operations increased due to increased investment income and cost management initiatives, partially offset by higher senior outpatient and behavioral health care activity and costs associated with serving newly added patients under value-based care arrangements. Optum Health served approximately 103 million people as of June 30, 2023 compared to 101 million people as of June 30, 2022. Optum Insight Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Insight increased due to growth in business services as a result of business combinations and growth in technology services. 20 Table of Contents Optum Rx Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to growth in specialty pharmacy offerings and higher script volumes from growth in people served. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 381 million and 357 million adjusted scripts in the second quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 27,359 $ 12,190 $ 15,169 Issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net of repayments 7,695 6,162 1,533 Proceeds from common stock issuances 628 756 (128) Customer funds administered 4,069 5,786 (1,717) Total sources of cash 39,751 24,894 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (5,000) (5,000) — Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (8,161) (7,150) (1,011) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (1,574) (3,366) 1,792 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (1,589) (1,212) (377) Cash dividends paid (3,284) (2,908) (376) Other (1,801) (2,078) 277 Total uses of cash (21,409) (21,714) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 106 57 49 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 18,448 $ 3,237 $ 15,211 2023 Cash Flows Compared to 2022 Cash Flows Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by an increase in unearned revenue due to the June receipt of our July CMS premium payment of $11.8 billion and changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt and decreased net purchases of investments, partially offset by decreased customer funds administered and increased cash paid for acquisitions. Financial Condition As of June 30, 2023, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $90.1 billion included approximately $41.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.2 billion was available for general corporate use), $44.1 billion of debt securities and $4.2 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.9 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of June 30, 2023. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. 21 Table of Contents Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Cash Requirements. A summary of our cash requirements as of December 31, 2022 was disclosed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2022 10-K. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs. We continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and business combinations. Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2022 10-K. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of June 30, 2023, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 40%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2022 10-K. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of June 30, 2023 were as follows: Moody’s (a) S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Positive A+ Stable A Stable A Stable Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1+ n/a (a) On July 27, 2023, Moody’s upgraded the credit rating on our senior unsecured debt to A2 with an outlook of Stable and the credit rating on our commercial paper to P-1. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased approximately 10 million shares at an average price of $483.78 per share. As of June 30, 2023, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to 21 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In June 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $7.52 compared to $6.60 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Pending Acquisitions. As of June 30, 2023, we have entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated consideration required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $5 billion. For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 in our 2022 10-K. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS There are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 22 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 in our 2022 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2022 10-K. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities law. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; cyberattacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; risks and uncertainties associated with our businesses providing pharmacy care services; competitive pressures, including our ability to maintain or increase our market share; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers; the impact of potential changes in tax laws and regulations; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to complete, manage or integrate strategic transactions; risks associated with public health crises arising from large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, natural disasters and other extreme events; failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; failure to protect proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products; downgrades in our credit ratings; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of June 30, 2023 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): June 30, 2023 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 1,025 $ 469 $ (3,500) $ (8,164) 1 512 234 (1,799) (4,458) (1) (512) (207) 1,882 5,415 (2) (1,025) (410) 3,817 12,059 Note: The impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates may not reflect the full 100 or 200 basis point change on interest income and interest expense or on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities as the rates are assumed to not fall below zero. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2023. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2023. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Consolidated Financial Statements 5 Table of Contents UnitedHealth Group Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 as filed with the SEC (2022 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. Use of Estimates These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenues - Products and Services As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, accounts receivable related to products and services were $ 8.1 billion and $ 7.1 billion, respectively. Revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracting having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related undelivered performance obligations, was $ 12.3 billion, of which approximately half is expected to be recognized in the next three years . 6 Table of Contents 2.

The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was not material. 7 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of March 31, 2023, by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 4,722 $ 4,691 $ 377 $ 376 Due after one year through five years 14,356 13,708 261 254 Due after five years through ten years 12,240 11,217 24 22 Due after ten years 5,646 5,351 20 17 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 8,213 7,540 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,156 2,874 — — Total debt securities $ 48,333 $ 45,381 $ 682 $ 669 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses March 31, 2023 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 1,279 $ ( 12 ) $ 1,825 $ ( 224 ) $ 3,104 $ ( 236 ) State and municipal obligations 1,898 ( 30 ) 3,110 ( 335 ) 5,008 ( 365 ) Corporate obligations 6,337 ( 178 ) 12,443 ( 1,347 ) 18,780 ( 1,525 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,589 ( 55 ) 4,274 ( 653 ) 5,863 ( 708 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 783 ( 26 ) 1,989 ( 257 ) 2,772 ( 283 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 11,886 $ ( 301 ) $ 23,641 $ ( 2,816 ) $ 35,527 $ ( 3,117 ) December 31, 2022 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 2,007 $ ( 96 ) $ 1,290 $ ( 189 ) $ 3,297 $ ( 285 ) State and municipal obligations 4,630 ( 288 ) 1,178 ( 191 ) 5,808 ( 479 ) Corporate obligations 13,003 ( 893 ) 6,637 ( 905 ) 19,640 ( 1,798 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,561 ( 345 ) 2,239 ( 463 ) 5,800 ( 808 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,698 ( 128 ) 976 ( 166 ) 2,674 ( 294 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 24,899 $ ( 1,750 ) $ 12,320 $ ( 1,914 ) $ 37,219 $ ( 3,664 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of March 31, 2023 were generated from approximately 32,000 positions out of a total of 42,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company’s assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of March 31, 2023, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was not material. 8 Table of Contents 3. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2022 10-K. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value March 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents $ 41,851 $ 62 $ — $ 41,913 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 4,122 407 — 4,529 State and municipal obligations — 7,755 — 7,755 Corporate obligations 16 22,486 181 22,683 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 7,540 — 7,540 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,874 — 2,874 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 4,138 41,062 181 45,381 Equity securities 2,128 35 70 2,233 Assets under management 1,491 2,245 101 3,837 Total assets at fair value $ 49,608 $ 43,404 $ 352 $ 93,364 Percentage of total assets at fair value 53 % 46 % 1 % 100 % December 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 23,202 $ 163 $ — $ 23,365 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,505 304 — 3,809 State and municipal obligations — 7,248 — 7,248 Corporate obligations 7 21,695 192 21,894 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 6,586 — 6,586 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,784 — 2,784 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,512 38,617 192 42,321 Equity securities 2,043 35 70 2,148 Assets under management 1,788 2,203 96 4,087 Total assets at fair value $ 30,545 $ 41,018 $ 358 $ 71,921 Percentage of total assets at fair value 42 % 57 % 1 % 100 % There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2023 or 2022. 9 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value March 31, 2023 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 595 $ 74 $ — $ 669 $ 682 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 60,307 $ — $ 60,307 $ 62,360 December 31, 2022 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 577 $ 102 $ — $ 679 $ 696 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 53,626 $ — $ 53,626 $ 56,823 Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2023 or 2022. 4. Medical Costs Payable The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the three months ended March 31: (in millions) 2023 2022 Medical costs payable, beginning of period $ 29,056 $ 24,483 Acquisitions 1 8 Reported medical costs: Current year 60,315 52,813 Prior years ( 470 ) ( 290 ) Total reported medical costs 59,845 52,523 Medical payments: Payments for current year ( 35,087 ) ( 29,589 ) Payments for prior years ( 22,006 ) ( 18,749 ) Total medical payments ( 57,093 ) ( 48,338 ) Medical costs payable, end of period $ 31,809 $ 28,676 For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, prior years’ medical cost reserve development included no individual factors that were significant. Medical costs payable included reserves for claims incurred by insured customers but not yet reported to the Company of $ 21.7 billion and $ 20.0 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 10 Table of Contents 5. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt In March 2023, the Company issued $ 6.5 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of the following: (in millions, except percentages) Par Value 4.250 % notes due January 2029 $ 1,250 4.500 % notes due April 2033 1,500 5.050 % notes due April 2053 2,000 5.200 % notes due April 2063 1,750 As of March 31, 2023, the Company had $ 8.2 billion of commercial paper outstanding, with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 5.2 %. For more information on the Company’s short-term borrowings, debt covenants and long-term debt, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2022 10-K. 6. Commitments and Contingencies Legal Matters The Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, the DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome which may result from this matter given its procedural status. 11 Table of Contents 7. Business Combinations During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company completed several business combinations for total consideration of $ 8.0 billion. Acquired assets (liabilities) at acquisition date were: (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 142 Accounts receivable and other current assets 530 Property, equipment and other long-term assets 659 Other intangible assets 2,141 Total identifiable assets acquired 3,472 Medical costs payable ( 1 ) Accounts payable and other current liabilities ( 467 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 698 ) Total identifiable liabilities acquired ( 1,166 ) Total net identifiable assets 2,306 Goodwill 6,646 Redeemable noncontrolling interests ( 130 ) Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests ( 819 ) Net assets acquired $ 8,003 The majority of goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The preliminary purchase price allocations for the various business combinations are subject to adjustment as valuation analyses, primarily related to intangible assets and contingent liabilities, are finalized. The acquisition date fair values and weighted-average useful lives assigned to intangible assets were: (in millions, except years) Fair Value Weighted-Average Useful Life Acquired finite-lived intangible assets: Customer-related $ 234 13 years Trademarks and technology 220 5 years Other 10 11 years Total acquired finite-lived intangible assets 464 9 years Total acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets - operating licenses and certificates 1,677 Total acquired intangible assets $ 2,141 The results of operations and financial condition of acquired entities have been included in the Company’s consolidated results and the results of the corresponding operating segment as of the date of acquisition. Through March 31, 2023, acquired entities impact on revenues and net earnings was not material. Unaudited pro forma revenues and net earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, as if the business combinations had occurred on January 1, 2022, were immaterial for both periods. 12 Table of Contents 8. Segment Financial Information The Company’s four reportable segments are UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx. For more information on the Company’s segments, see Part I, Item I, “Business” and Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2022 10-K. Total assets at Optum Health increased to $ 80.4 billion as of March 31, 2023 compared to $ 69.0 billion as of December 31, 2022, primarily due to goodwill from business combinations of $ 5.9 billion.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and with our 2022 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in that report. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the terms “UnitedHealth Group,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 2, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2022 10-K and in the discussion below. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. We have four reportable segments: • Optum Health; • Optum Insight; • Optum Rx; and • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2022 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of expected future costs, including inflation and labor market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. Government programs in the community and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, care activity and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve quality, affordable care. 14 Table of Contents Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Medicare Advantage Rates. Medicare Advantage rate notices over the years have at times resulted in industry base rates well below industry forward medical trend. For example, the Final Notice for 2024 rates resulted in an industry base rate decrease, well short of what is an increasing industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Further, substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient’s health status and care resource needs, will result in reduced funding and potentially benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges. As a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS The following summarizes select first quarter 2023 year-over-year operating comparisons to first quarter 2022 and other financial results. • Consolidated revenues grew 15%, UnitedHealthcare revenues grew 13% and Optum revenues grew 25%. • UnitedHealthcare served 1.9 million more people, driven by growth across our U.S. businesses. • Consolidated earnings from operations of $8.1 billion compared to $7.0 billion last year, included growth of 14% at UnitedHealthcare and 19% at Optum. • Diluted earnings per common share were $5.95. • Cash flows from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $16.3 billion. • Return on equity was 28.2%. 15 Table of Contents RESULTS SUMMARY The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information: (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022 Revenues: Premiums $ 72,786 $ 64,070 $ 8,716 14 % Products 10,267 9,340 927 10 Services 8,080 6,372 1,708 27 Investment and other income 798 367 431 117 Total revenues 91,931 80,149 11,782 15 Operating costs: Medical costs 59,845 52,523 7,322 14 Operating costs 13,625 11,401 2,224 20 Cost of products sold 9,405 8,487 918 11 Depreciation and amortization 970 788 182 23 Total operating costs 83,845 73,199 10,646 15 Earnings from operations 8,086 6,950 1,136 16 Interest expense (754) (433) (321) 74 Earnings before income taxes 7,332 6,517 815 13 Provision for income taxes (1,558) (1,369) (189) 14 Net earnings 5,774 5,148 626 12 Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (163) (121) (42) 35 Net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 5,611 $ 5,027 $ 584 12 % Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 5.95 $ 5.27 $ 0.68 13 % Medical care ratio (a) 82.2 % 82.0 % 0.2 % Operating cost ratio 14.8 14.2 0.6 Operating margin 8.8 8.7 0.1 Tax rate 21.2 21.0 0.2 Net earnings margin (b) 6.1 6.3 (0.2) Return on equity (c) 28.2 % 27.8 % 0.4 % (a) Medical care ratio (MCR) is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue. (b) Net earnings margin attributable to UnitedHealth Group shareholders. (c) Return on equity is calculated as annualized net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders divided by average shareholders’ equity. Average shareholders’ equity is calculated using the shareholders’ equity balance at the end of the preceding year and the shareholders’ equity balances at the end of each of the quarters in the year presented. 2023 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2022 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues The increases in revenues were primarily driven by growth in the number of people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, pricing trends and growth across the Optum businesses. Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased primarily due to growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. The MCR increased as a result of business mix. Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio increased primarily due to business mix and investments to support future growth, partially offset by continued productivity advances. 16 Table of Contents Reportable Segments See Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including people served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the level and scope of services provided to people and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment. The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022 Revenues UnitedHealthcare $ 70,468 $ 62,595 $ 7,873 13 % Optum Health 23,004 16,682 6,322 38 Optum Insight 4,496 3,219 1,277 40 Optum Rx 27,418 23,911 3,507 15 Optum eliminations (859) (553) (306) 55 Optum 54,059 43,259 10,800 25 Eliminations (32,596) (25,705) (6,891) 27 Consolidated revenues $ 91,931 $ 80,149 $ 11,782 15 % Earnings from operations UnitedHealthcare $ 4,343 $ 3,798 $ 545 14 % Optum Health 1,776 1,366 410 30 Optum Insight 907 847 60 7 Optum Rx 1,060 939 121 13 Optum 3,743 3,152 591 19 Consolidated earnings from operations $ 8,086 $ 6,950 $ 1,136 16 % Operating margin UnitedHealthcare 6.2 % 6.1 % 0.1 % Optum Health 7.7 8.2 (0.5) Optum Insight 20.2 26.3 (6.1) Optum Rx 3.9 3.9 — Optum 6.9 7.3 (0.4) Consolidated operating margin 8.8 % 8.7 % 0.1 % 17 Table of Contents UnitedHealthcare The following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Domestic $ 16,544 $ 15,822 $ 722 5 % UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Global 2,163 2,133 30 1 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Total 18,707 17,955 752 4 UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement 33,006 29,100 3,906 13 UnitedHealthcare Community & State 18,755 15,540 3,215 21 Total UnitedHealthcare revenues $ 70,468 $ 62,595 $ 7,873 13 % The following table summarizes the number of people served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in thousands, except percentages) 2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022 Commercial - Domestic: Risk-based 8,025 7,950 75 1 % Fee-based 19,325 18,460 865 5 Total Commercial - Domestic 27,350 26,410 940 4 Medicare Advantage 7,545 6,890 655 10 Medicaid 8,380 7,810 570 7 Medicare Supplement (Standardized) 4,320 4,355 (35) (1) Total Community and Senior 20,245 19,055 1,190 6 Total UnitedHealthcare - Domestic Medical 47,595 45,465 2,130 5 Commercial - Global 5,295 5,500 (205) (4) Total UnitedHealthcare - Medical 52,890 50,965 1,925 4 % Supplemental Data: Medicare Part D stand-alone 3,380 3,360 20 1 % UnitedHealthcare’s revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth in the number of people served through individual and group Medicare Advantage plans; growth in existing Medicaid markets; including a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs; and an increase in the number of people served through risk-based and fee-based commercial offerings. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows: Optum Health Revenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in patients served under value-based care arrangements and business combinations. Earnings from operations increased due to organic growth in the number of people served under value-based care arrangements and cost management initiatives. Optum Health served approximately 103 million people as of March 31, 2023 compared to 100 million people as of March 31, 2022. Optum Insight Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Insight increased due growth in business services as a result of business combinations and growth in technology services. Optum Rx Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served and growth in specialty pharmacy offerings. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 378 million and 352 million adjusted scripts in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. 18 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 16,327 $ 5,319 $ 11,008 Issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net of repayments 12,375 2,048 10,327 Proceeds from common stock issuances 344 551 (207) Customer funds administered 5,012 5,120 (108) Total sources of cash 34,058 13,038 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (2,000) (2,500) 500 Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (7,826) (1,231) (6,595) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (2,319) (1,632) (687) Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (760) (555) (205) Cash dividends paid (1,537) (1,363) (174) Other (1,119) (1,807) 688 Total uses of cash (15,561) (9,088) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 51 157 (106) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 18,548 $ 4,107 $ 14,441 2023 Cash Flows Compared to 2022 Cash Flows Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by an increase in unearned revenue due to the March receipt of our April CMS premium payment of $11.2 billion and increased net earnings, partially offset by changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, partially offset by increased cash paid for acquisitions and net purchases of investments. Financial Condition As of March 31, 2023, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $91.2 billion included approximately $41.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $7.0 billion was available for general corporate use), $45.4 billion of debt securities and $3.9 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 4.0 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of March 31, 2023. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Cash Requirements. A summary of our cash requirements as of December 31, 2022 was disclosed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2022 10-K. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs. We continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and business combinations. 19 Table of Contents Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2022 10-K. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of March 31, 2023, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 42%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2022 10-K. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of March 31, 2023 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Positive A+ Stable A Stable A Stable Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1+ n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares at an average price of $484.83 per share. As of March 31, 2023, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to 27 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. Our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders reflects an annual dividend rate of $6.60 per share. For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 in our 2022 10-K. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS There are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 in our 2022 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2022 10-K. 20 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities law. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; cyberattacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; risks and uncertainties associated with our businesses providing pharmacy care services; competitive pressures, including our ability to maintain or increase our market share; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers; the impact of potential changes in tax laws and regulations (including any increase in the U.S. income tax rate applicable to corporations); increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete, manage or integrate strategic transactions; risks associated with public health crises arising from large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, natural disasters and other extreme events; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; failure to protect proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products; downgrades in our credit ratings; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of March 31, 2023 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): March 31, 2023 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 1,027 $ 487 $ (3,684) $ (8,701) 1 513 244 (1,894) (4,741) (1) (513) (216) 1,979 5,729 (2) (1,027) (428) 4,008 12,724 Note: The impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates may not reflect the full 100 or 200 basis point change on interest income and interest expense or on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities as the rates are assumed to not fall below zero. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2023.

Basis of Presentation UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 as filed with the SEC (2021 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. Use of Estimates These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. 7 Table of Contents 2. Investments A summary of debt securities by major security type is as follows: (in millions) Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value September 30, 2022 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 3,752 $ — $ ( 299 ) $ 3,453 State and municipal obligations 7,380 2 ( 621 ) 6,761 Corporate obligations 22,533 1 ( 2,057 ) 20,477 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,868 1 ( 875 ) 5,994 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,164 — ( 295 ) 2,869 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 43,697 4 ( 4,147 ) 39,554 Debt securities - held-to-maturity: U.S. government and agency obligations 538 — ( 16 ) 522 State and municipal obligations 29 — ( 4 ) 25 Corporate obligations 74 — — 74 Total debt securities - held-to-maturity 641 — ( 20 ) 621 Total debt securities $ 44,338 $ 4 $ ( 4,167 ) $ 40,175 December 31, 2021 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 3,206 $ 23 $ ( 31 ) $ 3,198 State and municipal obligations 6,829 297 ( 20 ) 7,106 Corporate obligations 20,947 372 ( 145 ) 21,174 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 5,868 88 ( 55 ) 5,901 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,819 42 ( 23 ) 2,838 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 39,669 822 ( 274 ) 40,217 Debt securities - held-to-maturity: U.S. government and agency obligations 511 2 ( 2 ) 511 State and municipal obligations 30 2 — 32 Corporate obligations 100 — — 100 Total debt securities - held-to-maturity 641 4 ( 2 ) 643 Total debt securities $ 40,310 $ 826 $ ( 276 ) $ 40,860 The Company held $ 3.4 billion and $ 3.5 billion of equity securities as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments, other venture investments and shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.3 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was not material. 8 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of September 30, 2022, by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 3,840 $ 3,809 $ 330 $ 326 Due after one year through five years 12,565 11,755 257 246 Due after five years through ten years 12,172 10,608 34 32 Due after ten years 5,088 4,519 20 17 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,868 5,994 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,164 2,869 — — Total debt securities $ 43,697 $ 39,554 $ 641 $ 621 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses September 30, 2022 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 2,484 $ ( 170 ) $ 866 $ ( 129 ) $ 3,350 $ ( 299 ) State and municipal obligations 5,811 ( 470 ) 833 ( 151 ) 6,644 ( 621 ) Corporate obligations 15,374 ( 1,292 ) 4,364 ( 765 ) 19,738 ( 2,057 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 4,201 ( 517 ) 1,609 ( 358 ) 5,810 ( 875 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,182 ( 172 ) 670 ( 123 ) 2,852 ( 295 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 30,052 $ ( 2,621 ) $ 8,342 $ ( 1,526 ) $ 38,394 $ ( 4,147 ) December 31, 2021 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 1,976 $ ( 18 ) $ 249 $ ( 13 ) $ 2,225 $ ( 31 ) State and municipal obligations 1,386 ( 19 ) 31 ( 1 ) 1,417 ( 20 ) Corporate obligations 9,357 ( 130 ) 376 ( 15 ) 9,733 ( 145 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,078 ( 52 ) 116 ( 3 ) 3,194 ( 55 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,321 ( 18 ) 114 ( 5 ) 1,435 ( 23 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 17,118 $ ( 237 ) $ 886 $ ( 37 ) $ 18,004 $ ( 274 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of September 30, 2022 were generated from approximately 36,000 positions out of a total of 40,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities that impacted the Company’s assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of September 30, 2022, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was not material. 9 Table of Contents 3. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2021 10-K. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value September 30, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 38,671 $ 174 $ — $ 38,845 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,302 151 — 3,453 State and municipal obligations — 6,761 — 6,761 Corporate obligations 85 20,213 179 20,477 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 5,994 — 5,994 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,869 — 2,869 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,387 35,988 179 39,554 Equity securities 1,901 17 68 1,986 Assets under management 1,727 2,207 88 4,022 Total assets at fair value $ 45,686 $ 38,386 $ 335 $ 84,407 Percentage of total assets at fair value 54 % 45 % 1 % 100 % December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 21,359 $ 16 $ — $ 21,375 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,017 181 — 3,198 State and municipal obligations — 7,106 — 7,106 Corporate obligations 40 20,916 218 21,174 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 5,901 — 5,901 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,838 — 2,838 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,057 36,942 218 40,217 Equity securities 2,090 23 64 2,177 Assets under management 1,972 2,376 101 4,449 Total assets at fair value $ 28,478 $ 39,357 $ 383 $ 68,218 Percentage of total assets at fair value 42 % 57 % 1 % 100 % There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 or 2021. 10 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value September 30, 2022 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 534 $ 87 $ — $ 621 $ 641 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 43,705 $ — $ 43,705 $ 48,667 December 31, 2021 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 534 $ 102 $ 7 $ 643 $ 641 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 52,583 $ — $ 52,583 $ 46,003 Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 or 2021. 4. Medical Costs Payable The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the nine months ended September 30: (in millions) 2022 2021 Medical costs payable, beginning of period $ 24,483 $ 21,872 Acquisitions 177 88 Reported medical costs: Current year 157,601 140,052 Prior years ( 350 ) ( 1,300 ) Total reported medical costs 157,251 138,752 Medical payments: Payments for current year ( 130,788 ) ( 116,135 ) Payments for prior years ( 22,059 ) ( 18,659 ) Total medical payments ( 152,847 ) ( 134,794 ) Medical costs payable, end of period $ 29,064 $ 25,918 For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, prior years’ medical cost reserve development included no individual factors that were significant. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, prior years’ medical cost reserve development was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization and the uncertainty of care patterns due to the disruption of the health care system caused by COVID-19. Medical costs payable included reserves for claims incurred by insured customers but not yet reported to the Company of $ 20.0 billion and $ 17.1 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 5. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt In May 2022, the Company issued $ 6.0 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of the following: (in millions, except percentages) Par Value 3.700 % notes due May 2027 $ 600 4.000 % notes due May 2029 900 4.200 % notes due May 2032 1,500 4.750 % notes due May 2052 2,000 4.950 % notes due May 2062 1,000 11 Table of Contents In October 2022, the Company issued $ 9.0 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of the following: (in millions, except percentages) Par Value 5.000 % notes due October 2024 $ 500 5.150 % notes due October 2025 750 5.250 % notes due February 2028 1,000 5.300 % notes due February 2030 1,250 5.350 % notes due February 2033 2,000 5.875 % notes due February 2053 2,000 6.050 % notes due February 2063 1,500 For more information on the Company’s short-term borrowings, debt covenants and long-term debt, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2021 10-K. 6. Dividends In June 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $6.60 compared to $5.80 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2021. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The following table provides details of the Company’s 2022 dividend payments: Payment Date Amount per Share Total Amount Paid (in millions) March 22 $ 1.45 $ 1,363 June 28 1.65 1,545 September 20 1.65 1,542 7. Commitments and Contingencies Pending Business Combinations As of September 30, 2022, the Company has entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, most notably Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG) and LHC Group, Inc (NASDAQ: LHCG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. As of that date, the total anticipated capital required for these business combinations, excluding associated disposition proceeds and the payoff of acquired indebtedness, was approximately $ 14 billion. The Company completed the acquisition of Change Healthcare on October 3, 2022. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. 12 Table of Contents Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office for Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper Medicare risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, the DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status. 8. Business Combinations During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company completed several business combinations for total consideration of $ 8.2 billion.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and with our 2021 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in that report. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the terms “UnitedHealth Group,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 2, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2021 10-K and in the discussion below. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group Incorporated is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, Optum and UnitedHealthcare: • Optum Health; • Optum Insight; • Optum Rx; and • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2021 10-K and additional information on our segments, including the realignment of our UnitedHealthcare operating segments to combine UnitedHealthcare Global and UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 9 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. Overall spending on health care is impacted by inflation, utilization, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including inflation and labor market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. Government programs in the community and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. COVID-19 related care and testing costs as well as the deferral of care have also impacted medical cost trends in the current year and may continue in future years. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians 17 Table of Contents and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care. COVID-19 Trends and Uncertainties During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, overall care was near normal baseline levels, with certain areas of care at or approaching seasonal baselines, and other areas below. Future care patterns and acuity may temporarily rise due to missed regular care. Future developments, such as the severity of new COVID-19 variants, could introduce new uncertainties to care patterns and our business.

Medical Costs and MCR For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, medical costs increased due to growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. The MCR decreased due to COVID-19 effects, partially offset by business mix. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the decreases to the MCR were also partially offset by decreased prior years favorable development, primarily due to the effects of COVID-19 in 2021. 19 Table of Contents Operating Cost Ratio For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the operating cost ratio decreased primarily due to productivity gains, offset by business mix and investments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the operating cost ratio also decreased due to COVID-19 related revenue effects. Reportable Segments See Note 9 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including people served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the mix of care delivered through value-based care models at Optum Health, level and scope of services provided to people and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment.

The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements due to COVID-19 and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans. UnitedHealthcare’s revenues increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, including a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, earnings from operations increased due to growth in people served and COVID-19 effects. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, earnings from operations increased due to growth in people served and COVID-19 effects, partially offset by decreased prior years favorable development, primarily due to the effects of COVID-19 in 2021. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows: Optum Health Revenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in value-based care arrangements and business combinations. Earnings from operations increased due to organic growth in the number of people served under value-based care arrangements, cost management initiatives, asset dispositions and COVID-19 effects. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, increases in earnings from operations were partially offset by care activity levels at fee-for-service practices. Optum Health served approximately 101 million people as of September 30, 2022 compared to 99 million people as of September 30, 2021. 21 Table of Contents Optum Insight Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Insight increased due to growth in technology and managed services, with managed services growth driven by higher payer volumes and new health system partnerships. Optum Rx Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic growth in pharmacy care services, including community-behavioral and specialty pharmacy. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 359 million and 344 million adjusted scripts in the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 30,739 $ 19,125 $ 11,614 Issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net of repayments 3,806 3,733 73 Proceeds from common stock issuances 1,084 1,077 7 Customer funds administered 7,028 1,402 5,626 Other 50 — 50 Total sources of cash 42,707 25,337 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (6,000) (3,950) (2,050) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (7,154) (4,727) (2,427) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (4,067) (3,702) (365) Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (1,936) (1,759) (177) Cash dividends paid (4,450) (3,915) (535) Purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests (176) (1,338) 1,162 Other (1,458) (1,737) 279 Total uses of cash (25,241) (21,128) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 4 (45) 49 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 17,470 $ 4,164 $ 13,306 2022 Cash Flows Compared to 2021 Cash Flows Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by an increase in unearned revenue due to the September receipt of our October CMS premium payment of $9.8 billion and increased net earnings. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased customer funds administered, primarily driven by Medicare Part D timing, and decreased purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests, partially offset by increased cash paid for acquisitions and common stock repurchases. Financial Condition As of September 30, 2022, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $81.8 billion included approximately $38.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $3.7 billion was available for general corporate use), $39.6 billion of debt securities and $3.4 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 4.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of September 30, 2022. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. 22 Table of Contents Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Cash Requirements. A summary of our cash requirements as of December 31, 2021 was disclosed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2021 10-K. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs. We continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and business combinations. Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2021 10-K. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of September 30, 2022, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 35%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2021 10-K. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of September 30, 2022 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Positive A+ Stable A Stable A Stable Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1+ n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares at an average price of $497.41 per share. As of September 30, 2022, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to 33 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In June 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $6.60 compared to $5.80 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Pending Business Combinations. As of September 30, 2022, we have entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, most notably Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG) and LHC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LHCG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. As of that date, the total anticipated capital required for these business combinations, excluding associated disposition proceeds and the payoff of acquired indebtedness, was approximately $14 billion. The Company completed the acquisition of Change Healthcare on October 3, 2022. For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 in our 2021 10-K. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS There are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 23 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 in our 2021 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2021 10-K. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities law. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; cyberattacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; failure to protect proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products; risks and uncertainties associated with our businesses providing pharmacy care services; competitive pressures, including our ability to develop and deliver innovative products to health care payers and expand access to virtual care; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives; the impact of potential changes in tax laws and regulations (including any increase in the U.S. income tax rate applicable to corporations); failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of strategic transactions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; downgrades in our credit ratings; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. 24 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of September 30, 2022 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): September 30, 2022 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 845 $ 186 $ (3,027) $ (6,014) 1 422 93 (1,563) (3,261) (1) (422) (93) 1,656 3,894 (2) (845) (186) 3,391 8,586 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2022. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Statements 6 Table of Contents UnitedHealth Group Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 as filed with the SEC (2021 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. Use of Estimates These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. 7 Table of Contents 2. Investments A summary of debt securities by major security type is as follows: (in millions) Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value June 30, 2022 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 3,808 $ 1 $ ( 209 ) $ 3,600 State and municipal obligations 7,725 25 ( 381 ) 7,369 Corporate obligations 22,080 5 ( 1,515 ) 20,570 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,275 2 ( 537 ) 5,740 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,926 — ( 201 ) 2,725 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 42,814 33 ( 2,843 ) 40,004 Debt securities - held-to-maturity: U.S. government and agency obligations 544 — ( 11 ) 533 State and municipal obligations 29 — ( 2 ) 27 Corporate obligations 141 — — 141 Total debt securities - held-to-maturity 714 — ( 13 ) 701 Total debt securities $ 43,528 $ 33 $ ( 2,856 ) $ 40,705 December 31, 2021 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 3,206 $ 23 $ ( 31 ) $ 3,198 State and municipal obligations 6,829 297 ( 20 ) 7,106 Corporate obligations 20,947 372 ( 145 ) 21,174 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 5,868 88 ( 55 ) 5,901 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,819 42 ( 23 ) 2,838 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 39,669 822 ( 274 ) 40,217 Debt securities - held-to-maturity: U.S. government and agency obligations 511 2 ( 2 ) 511 State and municipal obligations 30 2 — 32 Corporate obligations 100 — — 100 Total debt securities - held-to-maturity 641 4 ( 2 ) 643 Total debt securities $ 40,310 $ 826 $ ( 276 ) $ 40,860 The Company held $ 3.4 billion and $ 3.5 billion of equity securities as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments, other venture investments and shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.3 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was not material. 8 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of June 30, 2022, by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 3,439 $ 3,422 $ 385 $ 381 Due after one year through five years 13,237 12,672 295 288 Due after five years through ten years 12,332 11,213 14 13 Due after ten years 4,605 4,232 20 19 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,275 5,740 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,926 2,725 — — Total debt securities $ 42,814 $ 40,004 $ 714 $ 701 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses June 30, 2022 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 2,921 $ ( 152 ) $ 474 $ ( 57 ) $ 3,395 $ ( 209 ) State and municipal obligations 4,807 ( 355 ) 209 ( 26 ) 5,016 ( 381 ) Corporate obligations 16,894 ( 1,200 ) 2,261 ( 315 ) 19,155 ( 1,515 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 4,323 ( 356 ) 1,201 ( 181 ) 5,524 ( 537 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,354 ( 151 ) 354 ( 50 ) 2,708 ( 201 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 31,299 $ ( 2,214 ) $ 4,499 $ ( 629 ) $ 35,798 $ ( 2,843 ) December 31, 2021 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 1,976 $ ( 18 ) $ 249 $ ( 13 ) $ 2,225 $ ( 31 ) State and municipal obligations 1,386 ( 19 ) 31 ( 1 ) 1,417 ( 20 ) Corporate obligations 9,357 ( 130 ) 376 ( 15 ) 9,733 ( 145 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,078 ( 52 ) 116 ( 3 ) 3,194 ( 55 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,321 ( 18 ) 114 ( 5 ) 1,435 ( 23 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 17,118 $ ( 237 ) $ 886 $ ( 37 ) $ 18,004 $ ( 274 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of June 30, 2022 were generated from approximately 33,000 positions out of a total of 40,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities that impacted the Company’s assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of June 30, 2022, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was not material. 9 Table of Contents 3. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2021 10-K. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value June 30, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 24,546 $ 66 $ — $ 24,612 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,432 168 — 3,600 State and municipal obligations — 7,369 — 7,369 Corporate obligations 35 20,342 193 20,570 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 5,740 — 5,740 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,725 — 2,725 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,467 36,344 193 40,004 Equity securities 1,894 18 68 1,980 Assets under management 1,655 2,268 94 4,017 Total assets at fair value $ 31,562 $ 38,696 $ 355 $ 70,613 Percentage of total assets at fair value 45 % 54 % 1 % 100 % December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 21,359 $ 16 $ — $ 21,375 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,017 181 — 3,198 State and municipal obligations — 7,106 — 7,106 Corporate obligations 40 20,916 218 21,174 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 5,901 — 5,901 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,838 — 2,838 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,057 36,942 218 40,217 Equity securities 2,090 23 64 2,177 Assets under management 1,972 2,376 101 4,449 Total assets at fair value $ 28,478 $ 39,357 $ 383 $ 68,218 Percentage of total assets at fair value 42 % 57 % 1 % 100 % There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the six months ended June 30, 2022 or 2021. 10 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value June 30, 2022 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 597 $ 104 $ — $ 701 $ 714 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 48,549 $ — $ 48,549 $ 50,041 December 31, 2021 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 534 $ 102 $ 7 $ 643 $ 641 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 52,583 $ — $ 52,583 $ 46,003 Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during either the six months ended June 30, 2022 or 2021. 4. Medical Costs Payable The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the six months ended June 30: (in millions) 2022 2021 Medical costs payable, beginning of period $ 24,483 $ 21,872 Acquisitions 171 46 Reported medical costs: Current year 104,936 92,570 Prior years ( 320 ) ( 1,120 ) Total reported medical costs 104,616 91,450 Medical payments: Payments for current year ( 78,937 ) ( 69,808 ) Payments for prior years ( 21,355 ) ( 18,429 ) Total medical payments ( 100,292 ) ( 88,237 ) Medical costs payable, end of period $ 28,978 $ 25,131 For the six months ended June 30, 2022, prior years’ medical cost reserve development included no individual factors that were significant. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, prior years’ medical cost reserve development was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization and the uncertainty of care patterns due to the disruption of the health care system caused by COVID-19. Medical costs payable included reserves for claims incurred by insured customers but not yet reported to the Company of $ 20.3 billion and $ 17.1 billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 5. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt In May 2022, the Company issued $6.0 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of the following: (in millions, except percentages) Par Value 3.700 % notes due May 2027 $ 600 4.000 % notes due May 2029 900 4.200 % notes due May 2032 1,500 4.750 % notes due May 2052 2,000 4.950 % notes due May 2062 1,000 11 Table of Contents For more information on the Company’s short-term borrowings, debt covenants and long-term debt, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2021 10-K. 6. Dividends In June 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $6.60 compared to $5.80 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2021. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The following table provides details of the Company’s 2022 dividend payments: Payment Date Amount per Share Total Amount Paid (in millions) March 22 $ 1.45 $ 1,363 June 28 1.65 1,545 7. Commitments and Contingencies Pending Business Combinations As of June 30, 2022, the Company has entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, most notably Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG) and LHC Group, Inc (NASDAQ: LHCG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these business combinations, excluding associated disposition proceeds and the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $ 14 billion. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office for Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the DOJ, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper Medicare risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On 12 Table of Contents February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, the DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status. 8. Business Combinations During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company completed several business combinations for total consideration of $ 8.1 billion. Acquired assets (liabilities) at acquisition date were: (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 457 Accounts receivable and other current assets 585 Property, equipment and other long-term assets 1,494 Intangible assets 1,810 Total identifiable assets acquired 4,346 Medical costs payable ( 171 ) Accounts payable and other current liabilities ( 590 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 605 ) Total identifiable liabilities acquired ( 1,366 ) Total net identifiable assets 2,980 Goodwill 8,309 Redeemable noncontrolling interests ( 3,101 ) Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests ( 103 ) Net assets acquired $ 8,085 The majority of goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The preliminary purchase price allocations for the various business combinations are subject to adjustment as valuation analyses, primarily related to intangible assets and contingent liabilities, are finalized. The acquisition date fair values and weighted-average useful lives assigned to finite-lived intangible assets were: (in millions, except years) Fair Value Weighted-Average Useful Life Customer-related $ 915 9 years Trademarks and technology 800 9 years Other 80 11 years Total acquired finite-lived intangible assets $ 1,795 9 years The results of operations and financial condition of acquired entities have been included in the Company’s consolidated results and the results of the corresponding operating segment as of the date of acquisition. Through June 30, 2022, acquired entities impact on revenues and net earnings was not material. Unaudited pro forma revenues and net earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 as if the business combinations had occurred on January 1, 2021 were immaterial for both periods. 9. Segment Financial Information The Company’s four reportable segments are UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx. For more information on the Company’s segments, see Part I, Item I, “Business” and Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2021 10-K. Total assets at Optum Health and Optum Rx increased to $ 67.9 billion and $ 46.2 billion as of June 30, 2022 compared to $ 60.5 billion and $ 40.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase in total assets at Optum Health and Optum Rx was primarily due to goodwill from business combinations of $ 4.5 billion and $ 3.8 billion, respectively. 13 Table of Contents On January 1, 2022, the Company realigned its operating segments to combine UnitedHealthcare Global and UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual. The realignment had no impact on the Company’s reportable segments.

A description of some of the risks and uncertainties is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2021 10-K and in the discussion below. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group Incorporated is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, Optum and UnitedHealthcare: • Optum Health; • Optum Insight; • Optum Rx; and • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2021 10-K and additional information on our segments, including the realignment of our UnitedHealthcare operating segments to combine UnitedHealthcare Global and UnitedHealthcare Employer and Individual, can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 9 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. Overall spending on health care is impacted by inflation, utilization, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, such as the economic impact of COVID-19, and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any potential impacts from COVID-19. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. Government programs in the community and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. COVID-19 related care and testing costs as well as the deferral of care have also impacted medical cost trends in the current year and may continue in future years. Future medical cost trends may be impacted by increased consumer 16 Table of Contents demand for care, and potentially even higher acuity care, due to the temporary deferral of care since the onset of the pandemic. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care. The continued uncertain impact of COVID-19 may impact our ability to estimate medical costs payable, which has resulted in, and could result in, increased variability to medical cost reserve development. COVID-19 Trends and Uncertainties The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, overall care was near normal baseline levels, with certain areas of care at or approaching seasonal baselines, and other areas below. COVID-19 treatment and testing costs continue to be mitigated by the temporary deferral of care, both generally varying with COVID-19 incidence rates. The relationship between COVID-19 care costs and non-COVID-19 utilization lagged in the second quarter, with increased non-COVID-19 utilization not as rapidly coinciding with decreased COVID-19 care and incidence rates as it had throughout the pandemic. In future periods, care patterns may moderately exceed normal baselines as previously deferred care is obtained. Though not yet experienced, acuity may temporarily rise due to missed regular care. COVID-19 may continue to influence customer and consumer behavior, which could impact how and where care is delivered, benefit product designs, and the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services. Disrupted care patterns, as a result of the pandemic, have affected and may continue to temporarily affect the ability to obtain complete member health status information, impacting revenue in businesses utilizing risk adjustment methodologies. The ultimate overall impact is uncertain and dependent on the future pacing, intensity and duration of the pandemic, the severity of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccination and treatments and general economic uncertainty.

Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased due to growth in people served through Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and commercial offerings. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, MCR decreased due to COVID-19 effects and business mix. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, MCR decreased as a result of COVID-19 effects offset by business mix and decreased prior years favorable development, primarily due to the effects of COVID-19 in 2021. 18 Table of Contents Operating Cost Ratio For the three months ended June 30, 2022, the operating cost ratio increased primarily due to business mix and investments, partially offset by COVID-19 related revenue effects. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, the operating cost ratio decreased as a result of COVID-19 related revenue effects, partially offset by business mix. Reportable Segments See Note 9 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including people served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the mix of care delivered through value-based care models at Optum Health, level and scope of services provided to people and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment.

Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and group Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements due to COVID-19, new state-based awards and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans. UnitedHealthcare’s revenues increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, including a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs, and an increase in the number of individuals served through commercial benefits. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, earnings from operations increased due growth in people served and COVID-19 effects. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, earnings from operations increased due to growth in people served and COVID-19 effects, partially offset by decreased prior years favorable development, primarily due to the effects of COVID-19 in 2021. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows: Optum Health Revenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in value-based care arrangements and business combinations. Earnings from operations increased due to organic growth in value-based care arrangements, cost management initiatives and COVID-19 effects. Optum Health served approximately 101 million people as of June 30, 2022 compared to 99 million people as of June 30, 2021. 20 Table of Contents Optum Insight Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Insight increased due to growth in managed services and technology, with managed services growth driven by higher payer volumes and new health system partnerships. Optum Rx Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic growth in pharmacy care services, including community-behavioral and specialty pharmacy. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 357 million and 342 million adjusted scripts in the second quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 12,190 $ 11,545 $ 645 Issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net of repayments 6,162 4,858 1,304 Proceeds from common stock issuances 756 764 (8) Customer funds administered 5,786 2,395 3,391 Total sources of cash 24,894 19,562 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (5,000) (2,900) (2,100) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (7,150) (4,642) (2,508) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (3,366) (2,789) (577) Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (1,212) (1,130) (82) Cash dividends paid (2,908) (2,548) (360) Purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests (97) (1,338) 1,241 Other (1,981) (1,310) (671) Total uses of cash (21,714) (16,657) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 57 6 51 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,237 $ 2,911 $ 326 2022 Cash Flows Compared to 2021 Cash Flows Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by increased net earnings partially offset by changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased customer funds administered, primarily driven by Medicare Part D timing, net issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt and decreased purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests, partially offset by increased cash paid for acquisitions and share repurchases. Financial Condition As of June 30, 2022, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $68.0 billion included approximately $24.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.7 billion was available for general corporate use), $40.0 billion of debt securities and $3.4 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 4.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of June 30, 2022. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. 21 Table of Contents Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Cash Requirements. A summary of our cash requirements as of December 31, 2021 was disclosed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2021 10-K. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs. We continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and business combinations. Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2021 10-K. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of June 30, 2022, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 37%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2021 10-K. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of June 30, 2022 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Positive A+ Stable A Stable A Stable Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1+ n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we repurchased approximately 10 million shares at an average price of $492.11 per share. As of June 30, 2022, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to 35 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In June 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $6.60 compared to $5.80 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Pending Business Combinations. As of June 30, 2022, we have entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, most notably Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG) and LHC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LHCG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these business combinations, excluding associated disposition proceeds and the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $14 billion. For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 in our 2021 10-K. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS There are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 22 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 in our 2021 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2021 10-K. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities law. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; cyberattacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; failure to protect proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products; risks and uncertainties associated with our businesses providing pharmacy care services; competitive pressures, including our ability to develop and deliver innovative products to health care payers and expand access to virtual care; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives; the impact of potential changes in tax laws and regulations (including any increase in the U.S. income tax rate applicable to corporations); failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of strategic transactions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; downgrades in our credit ratings; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. 23 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of June 30, 2022 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): June 30, 2022 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 559 $ 215 $ (3,073) $ (7,035) 1 280 107 (1,583) (3,824) (1) (248) (107) 1,666 4,595 (2) (248) (191) 3,380 10,165 Note: Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2022, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 basis point reduction in interest income and the full 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense, as the rates are assumed not to fall below zero. As of June 30, 2022, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2022. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2022. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS A description of our legal proceedings is included in and incorporated by reference to Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 2021 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2021 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in our 2021 10-K. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 as filed with the SEC (2021 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. Use of Estimates These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. 6 Table of Contents 2. Investments A summary of debt securities by major security type is as follows: (in millions) Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value March 31, 2022 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 3,507 $ 4 $ ( 140 ) $ 3,371 State and municipal obligations 7,022 57 ( 224 ) 6,855 Corporate obligations 21,669 55 ( 811 ) 20,913 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,210 7 ( 316 ) 5,901 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,913 2 ( 112 ) 2,803 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 41,321 125 ( 1,603 ) 39,843 Debt securities - held-to-maturity: U.S. government and agency obligations 510 1 ( 9 ) 502 State and municipal obligations 29 — — 29 Corporate obligations 87 — — 87 Total debt securities - held-to-maturity 626 1 ( 9 ) 618 Total debt securities $ 41,947 $ 126 $ ( 1,612 ) $ 40,461 December 31, 2021 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 3,206 $ 23 $ ( 31 ) $ 3,198 State and municipal obligations 6,829 297 ( 20 ) 7,106 Corporate obligations 20,947 372 ( 145 ) 21,174 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 5,868 88 ( 55 ) 5,901 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,819 42 ( 23 ) 2,838 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 39,669 822 ( 274 ) 40,217 Debt securities - held-to-maturity: U.S. government and agency obligations 511 2 ( 2 ) 511 State and municipal obligations 30 2 — 32 Corporate obligations 100 — — 100 Total debt securities - held-to-maturity 641 4 ( 2 ) 643 Total debt securities $ 40,310 $ 826 $ ( 276 ) $ 40,860 The Company held $ 3.5 billion of equity securities as of both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments, other venture investments and shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.3 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector, as of both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was not material. 7 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of March 31, 2022, by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 2,987 $ 2,986 $ 217 $ 217 Due after one year through five years 12,900 12,608 355 347 Due after five years through ten years 12,055 11,461 29 29 Due after ten years 4,256 4,084 25 25 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,210 5,901 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,913 2,803 — — Total debt securities $ 41,321 $ 39,843 $ 626 $ 618 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses March 31, 2022 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 2,485 $ ( 96 ) $ 451 $ ( 44 ) $ 2,936 $ ( 140 ) State and municipal obligations 3,568 ( 204 ) 218 ( 20 ) 3,786 ( 224 ) Corporate obligations 14,237 ( 603 ) 2,049 ( 208 ) 16,286 ( 811 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 4,192 ( 201 ) 1,225 ( 115 ) 5,417 ( 316 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,097 ( 78 ) 348 ( 34 ) 2,445 ( 112 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 26,579 $ ( 1,182 ) $ 4,291 $ ( 421 ) $ 30,870 $ ( 1,603 ) December 31, 2021 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 1,976 $ ( 18 ) $ 249 $ ( 13 ) $ 2,225 $ ( 31 ) State and municipal obligations 1,386 ( 19 ) 31 ( 1 ) $ 1,417 $ ( 20 ) Corporate obligations 9,357 ( 130 ) 376 ( 15 ) $ 9,733 $ ( 145 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 3,078 ( 52 ) 116 ( 3 ) $ 3,194 $ ( 55 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,321 ( 18 ) 114 ( 5 ) $ 1,435 $ ( 23 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 17,118 $ ( 237 ) $ 886 $ ( 37 ) $ 18,004 $ ( 274 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of March 31, 2022 were generated from approximately 27,000 positions out of a total of 39,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities that impacted the Company’s assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of March 31, 2022, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was not material. 8 Table of Contents 3. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2021 10-K. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value March 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 25,382 $ 100 $ — $ 25,482 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,214 157 — 3,371 State and municipal obligations — 6,855 — 6,855 Corporate obligations 36 20,670 207 20,913 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 5,901 — 5,901 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,803 — 2,803 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,250 36,386 207 39,843 Equity securities 2,036 20 68 2,124 Assets under management 1,727 2,333 95 4,155 Total assets at fair value $ 32,395 $ 38,839 $ 370 $ 71,604 Percentage of total assets at fair value 45 % 54 % 1 % 100 % December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 21,359 $ 16 $ — $ 21,375 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,017 181 — 3,198 State and municipal obligations — 7,106 — 7,106 Corporate obligations 40 20,916 218 21,174 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 5,901 — 5,901 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,838 — 2,838 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,057 36,942 218 40,217 Equity securities 2,090 23 64 2,177 Assets under management 1,972 2,376 101 4,449 Total assets at fair value $ 28,478 $ 39,357 $ 383 $ 68,218 Percentage of total assets at fair value 42 % 57 % 1 % 100 % There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2022 or 2021. 9 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value March 31, 2022 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 525 $ 86 $ 7 $ 618 $ 626 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 46,686 $ — $ 46,686 $ 43,344 December 31, 2021 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 534 $ 102 $ 7 $ 643 $ 641 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 52,583 $ — $ 52,583 $ 46,003 Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during either the three months ended March 31, 2022 or 2021. 4. Medical Costs Payable The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the three months ended March 31: (in millions) 2022 2021 Medical costs payable, beginning of period $ 24,483 $ 21,872 Acquisitions 8 12 Reported medical costs: Current year 52,813 45,914 Prior years ( 290 ) ( 1,010 ) Total reported medical costs 52,523 44,904 Medical payments: Payments for current year ( 29,589 ) ( 25,960 ) Payments for prior years ( 18,749 ) ( 15,995 ) Total medical payments ( 48,338 ) ( 41,955 ) Medical costs payable, end of period $ 28,676 $ 24,833 For the three months ended March 31, 2022, prior years medical cost reserve development included no individual factors that were significant. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, prior years’ medical cost reserve development was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization and the uncertainty of care patterns due to the disruption of the health care system caused by COVID-19. Medical costs payable included reserves for claims incurred by insured customers but not yet reported to the Company of $ 19.5 billion and $ 17.1 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 5. Commitments and Contingencies Pending Acquisitions As of March 31, 2022, the Company has entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, most notably Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG) and LHC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LHCG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding associated disposition proceeds and the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $ 15 billion. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. 10 Table of Contents The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office for Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the DOJ, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper Medicare risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, the DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status. 11 Table of Contents 6. Segment Financial Information The Company’s four reportable segments are UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx. For more information on the Company’s segments see Part I, Item I, “Business” and Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2021 10-K.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and with our 2021 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in that report. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the terms “UnitedHealth Group,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 2, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2021 10-K and in the discussion below. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group Incorporated is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, Optum and UnitedHealthcare: • Optum Health; • Optum Insight; • Optum Rx; and • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2021 10-K and additional information on our segments, including the realignment of our UnitedHealthcare operating segments to combine UnitedHealthcare Global and UnitedHealthcare Employer and Individual, can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. Overall spending on health care is impacted by inflation, utilization, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, such as the economic impact of COVID-19, and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any potential impacts from COVID-19. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. Government programs in the community and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. COVID-19 related care and testing costs as well as the deferral of care have also impacted medical cost trends in the current year and may continue in future years. Future medical cost trends may be impacted by increased consumer 13 Table of Contents demand for care, potentially even higher acuity care, due to the temporary deferral of care since the onset of the pandemic. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care. The continued uncertain impact of COVID-19 may impact our ability to estimate medical costs payable, which has resulted in, and could result in, increased variability to medical cost reserve development. COVID-19 Trends and Uncertainties The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, overall care was near normal baseline levels. COVID-19 treatment and testing costs continue to be mitigated by the temporary deferral of care, both varying with COVID-19 incidence rates. In future periods, care patterns may moderately exceed normal baselines as previously deferred care is obtained. Though not yet experienced, acuity may temporarily rise due to missed regular care. COVID-19 may continue to influence customer and consumer behavior, which could impact how and where care is delivered, benefit product designs, and the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services. Disrupted care patterns, as a result of the pandemic, have affected and may continue to temporarily affect the ability to obtain complete member health status information, impacting revenue in businesses utilizing risk adjustment methodologies. The ultimate overall impact is uncertain and dependent on the future pacing, intensity and duration of the pandemic, the severity of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccination and treatments and general economic uncertainty.

Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs and MCR increased as a result of business mix and decreased favorable development. Medical costs also increased due to growth in people served through Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and commercial offerings. Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio decreased primarily due to COVID-19 related revenue effects, operating efficiency gains and business mix. 15 Table of Contents Reportable Segments See Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including people served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the mix of care delivered through value-based care models at Optum Health, level and scope of services provided to people and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment. The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 Revenues UnitedHealthcare $ 62,595 $ 55,114 $ 7,481 14 % Optum Health 16,682 12,403 4,279 34 Optum Insight 3,219 2,852 367 13 Optum Rx 23,911 21,604 2,307 11 Optum eliminations (553) (475) (78) 16 Optum 43,259 36,384 6,875 19 Eliminations (25,705) (21,302) (4,403) 21 Consolidated revenues $ 80,149 $ 70,196 $ 9,953 14 % Earnings from operations UnitedHealthcare $ 3,798 $ 4,108 $ (310) (8) % Optum Health 1,366 962 404 42 Optum Insight 847 779 68 9 Optum Rx 939 890 49 6 Optum 3,152 2,631 521 20 Consolidated earnings from operations $ 6,950 $ 6,739 $ 211 3 % Operating margin UnitedHealthcare 6.1 % 7.5 % (1.4) % Optum Health 8.2 7.8 0.4 Optum Insight 26.3 27.3 (1.0) Optum Rx 3.9 4.1 (0.2) Optum 7.3 7.2 0.1 Consolidated operating margin 8.7 % 9.6 % (0.9) % UnitedHealthcare The following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Domestic $ 15,822 $ 14,632 $ 1,190 8 % UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Global (a) 2,133 2,035 98 5 % UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Total (a) 17,955 16,667 1,288 8 % UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement 29,100 25,474 3,626 14 UnitedHealthcare Community & State 15,540 12,973 2,567 20 Total UnitedHealthcare revenues $ 62,595 $ 55,114 $ 7,481 14 % (a) On January 1, 2022, we realigned our operating segments to combine UnitedHealthcare Global and UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual. 16 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the number of people served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in thousands, except percentages) 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 Commercial - domestic: Risk-based 7,950 7,860 90 1 % Fee-based 18,460 18,455 5 — Total commercial - domestic 26,410 26,315 95 — Medicare Advantage 6,890 6,335 555 9 Medicaid 7,810 6,975 835 12 Medicare Supplement (Standardized) 4,355 4,390 (35) (1) Total community and senior 19,055 17,700 1,355 8 Total UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical 45,465 44,015 1,450 3 Commercial - global 5,500 5,460 40 1 Total UnitedHealthcare - medical 50,965 49,475 1,490 3 % Supplemental Data: Medicare Part D stand-alone 3,360 3,795 (435) (11) % Commercial business increased due to growth in risk-based offerings. Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and group Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements due to COVID-19, new state-based awards and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans. UnitedHealthcare’s revenues increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, including a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs, and an increase in the number of individuals served through commercial benefits. Earnings from operations declined primarily due to decreased favorable development partially offset by the factors impacting revenue and COVID-19 impacts. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows: Optum Health Revenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in value-based care arrangements and acquisitions. Earnings from operations increased due to organic growth in value-based care arrangements, COVID-19 effects and cost management initiatives. Optum Health served approximately 100 million people as of March 31, 2022 compared to 99 million people as of March 31, 2021. Optum Insight Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Insight increased due to growth in managed services and technology, with managed services growth driven by higher payer volumes and new health system partnerships. Optum Rx Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic growth in pharmacy care services, including community-behavioral, specialty pharmacy and e-commerce services. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 352 million and 329 million adjusted scripts in the first quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. 17 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 5,319 $ 6,005 $ (686) Issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net of repayments 2,048 2,907 (859) Proceeds from common stock issuances 551 436 115 Customer funds administered 5,120 2,131 2,989 Total sources of cash 13,038 11,479 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (2,500) (1,650) (850) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (1,231) (1,193) (38) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (1,632) (1,714) 82 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (555) (568) 13 Cash dividends paid (1,363) (1,181) (182) Other (1,807) (2,088) 281 Total uses of cash (9,088) (8,394) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 157 (51) 208 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 4,107 $ 3,034 $ 1,073 2022 Cash Flows Compared to 2021 Cash Flows Decreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased customer funds administered, partially offset by increased share repurchases and decreased net issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Financial Condition As of March 31, 2022, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $68.8 billion included approximately $25.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $2.5 billion was available for general corporate use), $39.8 billion of debt securities and $3.5 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 4.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of March 31, 2022. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Cash Requirements. A summary of our cash requirements as of December 31, 2021 was disclosed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2021 10-K. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs. We continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions. Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2021 10-K. 18 Table of Contents Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of March 31, 2022, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 37%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2021 10-K. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of March 31, 2022 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Stable A+ Stable A Stable A Stable Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1+ n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares at an average price of $485.12 per share. As of March 31, 2022, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 40 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. Our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders reflects an annual dividend rate of $5.80 per share. Pending Acquisitions. As of March 31, 2022, we have entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, most notably Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG) and LHC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LHCG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding associated disposition proceeds and the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $15 billion. For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2021 10-K. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS There are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2021 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2021 10-K. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities law. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical 19 Table of Contents emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; cyberattacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; failure to protect proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products; risks and uncertainties associated with our businesses providing pharmacy care services; competitive pressures, including our ability to develop and deliver innovative products to health care payers and expand access to virtual care; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives; the impact of potential changes in tax laws and regulations (including any increase in the U.S. income tax rate applicable to corporations); failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of strategic transactions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; downgrades in our credit ratings; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of March 31, 2022 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): March 31, 2022 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 578 $ 202 $ (3,090) $ (7,429) 1 289 101 (1,586) (4,041) (1) (92) (46) 1,650 4,857 (2) (92) (46) 3,280 10,710 Note: Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2022, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense, as the rates are assumed not to fall below zero. As of March 31, 2022, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2022. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2022. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and “the Company”) is a diversified health care company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access, affordability, experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 as filed with the SEC (2020 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. Use of Estimates These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. 7 Table of Contents 2.

The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments, shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds with readily determinable fair values and other venture investments. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.3 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was not material. 8 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of September 30, 2021, by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 2,871 $ 2,886 $ 234 $ 235 Due after one year through five years 13,492 13,826 333 334 Due after five years through ten years 12,062 12,406 26 27 Due after ten years 4,280 4,423 23 24 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,281 6,403 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,763 2,813 — — Total debt securities $ 41,749 $ 42,757 $ 616 $ 620 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses September 30, 2021 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 1,499 $ ( 16 ) $ 117 $ ( 7 ) $ 1,616 $ ( 23 ) State and municipal obligations 1,226 ( 15 ) — — 1,226 ( 15 ) Corporate obligations 6,471 ( 75 ) 326 ( 9 ) 6,797 ( 84 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,537 ( 34 ) — — 2,537 ( 34 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 830 ( 9 ) 92 ( 4 ) 922 ( 13 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 12,563 $ ( 149 ) $ 535 $ ( 20 ) $ 13,098 $ ( 169 ) December 31, 2020 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 346 $ ( 3 ) $ — $ — $ 346 $ ( 3 ) Corporate obligations 1,273 ( 9 ) 456 ( 3 ) 1,729 ( 12 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 601 ( 3 ) — — 601 ( 3 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 195 ( 1 ) 93 ( 3 ) 288 ( 4 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 2,415 $ ( 16 ) $ 549 $ ( 6 ) $ 2,964 $ ( 22 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of September 30, 2021 were generated from approximately 9,000 positions out of a total of 40,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities that impacted our assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of September 30, 2021, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was not material. 9 Table of Contents 3. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in the 2020 10-K. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value September 30, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 20,944 $ 141 $ — $ 21,085 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,446 226 — 3,672 State and municipal obligations — 7,419 — 7,419 Corporate obligations 62 22,165 223 22,450 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 6,403 — 6,403 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,813 — 2,813 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,508 39,026 223 42,757 Equity securities 1,972 22 64 2,058 Assets under management 1,930 2,271 103 4,304 Total assets at fair value $ 28,354 $ 41,460 $ 390 $ 70,204 Percentage of total assets at fair value 40 % 59 % 1 % 100 % December 31, 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 16,841 $ 80 $ — $ 16,921 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,241 224 — 3,465 State and municipal obligations — 7,328 — 7,328 Corporate obligations 25 19,424 288 19,737 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 7,091 — 7,091 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,207 — 2,207 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,266 36,274 288 39,828 Equity securities 1,795 33 — 1,828 Assets under management 1,774 2,250 52 4,076 Total assets at fair value $ 23,676 $ 38,637 $ 340 $ 62,653 Percentage of total assets at fair value 38 % 61 % 1 % 100 % There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 or 2020. 10 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value September 30, 2021 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 525 $ 88 $ 7 $ 620 $ 616 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 53,425 $ — $ 53,425 $ 46,965 December 31, 2020 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 466 $ 108 $ 73 $ 647 $ 638 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 51,254 $ — $ 51,254 $ 42,171 Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during either the nine months ended September 30, 2021 or 2020. 4. Medical Costs Payable The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the nine months ended September 30: (in millions) 2021 2020 Medical costs payable, beginning of period $ 21,872 $ 21,690 Acquisitions 88 186 Reported medical costs: Current year 140,052 118,114 Prior years ( 1,300 ) ( 800 ) Total reported medical costs 138,752 117,314 Medical payments: Payments for current year ( 116,135 ) ( 98,548 ) Payments for prior years ( 18,659 ) ( 19,475 ) Total medical payments ( 134,794 ) ( 118,023 ) Medical costs payable, end of period $ 25,918 $ 21,167 For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, prior years medical cost reserve development was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization. Medical costs payable included reserves for claims incurred by insured customers but not yet reported to the Company of $ 17.6 billion and $ 14.8 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 5. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt In May 2021, the Company issued $ 7.0 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of the following: (in millions, except percentages) Par Value 0.550 % notes due May 2024 $ 1,000 1.150 % notes due May 2026 1,000 2.300 % notes due May 2031 1,500 3.050 % notes due May 2041 1,500 3.250 % notes due May 2051 2,000 For more information on the Company’s short-term borrowings, debt covenants and long-term debt see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in the 2020 10-K. 11 Table of Contents 6. Dividends In June 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.80 compared to $5.00 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2020. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The following table provides details of the Company’s 2021 dividend payments: Payment Date Amount per Share Total Amount Paid (in millions) March 23 $ 1.25 $ 1,181 June 29 1.45 1,367 September 21 1.45 1,367 7. Commitments and Contingencies Pending Acquisitions The Company has entered into agreements to purchase companies in the health care sector, most notably Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG), subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $ 9 billion. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status. 12 Table of Contents 8.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the terms “UnitedHealth Group,” “we,” “our” or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 2, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2020 10-K and in the discussion below. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access, affordability, experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, Optum and UnitedHealthcare: • OptumHealth; • OptumInsight; • OptumRx; and • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2020 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. COVID-19 Trends and Uncertainties The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain. In the quarter ended September 30, 2021, overall care activity continued to increase, including a mix of temporary deferral of care activity and COVID-19 related care costs. The temporary deferral of care was more than offset by COVID-19 related care and testing costs, rebate requirements, and general economic impacts. In future periods, care patterns may moderately exceed normal baselines as previously deferred care is obtained and acuity temporarily rises due to missed regular care. From time to time, health system capacity may be subject to possible increased volatility due to the pandemic. Specific trends and uncertainties related to our two business platforms are as follows: Optum. COVID-19 related care costs continued to impact our OptumHealth risk-based care delivery businesses, which were partially offset by the continued temporary deferral of care. The temporary deferral of care reduced fee-for-service care delivery volume, as well as OptumInsight and OptumRx volume-based business activity, although we expect the impact to continue decreasing as care returns to, and potentially exceeds, normal levels. We believe COVID-19 will continue to influence customer and consumer behavior, both during and after the pandemic, which could impact how and where care is delivered and the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services. As a result of the dynamic situation and broad-reaching impact to the health system, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our Optum businesses is uncertain. 15 Table of Contents UnitedHealthcare. In 2021, we have continued expanded benefit coverage in areas such as COVID-19 related care and testing, telemedicine, and pharmacy; continuing to assist our customers, care providers, members and communities in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. UnitedHealthcare’s results of operations were negatively impacted by COVID-19 related care and testing, rebate requirements and other revenue impacts, as well as broader economic impacts, partially offset by the continued deferral of care. The increase in people served through Medicaid was attributable in part to continuing action by states to ease redetermination requirements due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. Disrupted care patterns, as a result of the pandemic, have and may continue to temporarily affect the ability to obtain complete member health status information, impacting revenue in businesses utilizing risk adjustment methodologies. The ultimate overall impact is uncertain and dependent on the future pacing and intensity of the pandemic, the duration of policies and initiatives to address COVID-19, and general economic uncertainty. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South American and certain other international health markets. Overall spending on health care is impacted by inflation; utilization; medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement; regulatory requirements; demographic trends in the population; and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions, such as the impacts of COVID-19, and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any potential impacts from COVID-19. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. Government programs in the community and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. COVID-19 related care costs as well as the deferral of care have also impacted medical cost trends in the current year and may continue in future years. Future medical cost trends may be impacted by increased consumer demand for care, potentially even higher acuity care, due to the temporary deferral of care since the onset of the pandemic. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care. The continued uncertain impact of COVID-19 may impact our ability to estimate medical costs payable, which has resulted in, and could result in, increased variability to medical cost reserve development. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of management’s view of regulatory trends and uncertainties. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation,” Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2020 10-K. Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2022 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 4.1%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend. We continue to manage costs through improving and expanding our coordinated care models, value-based care arrangements and various consumer engagement tools. Affordable Care Act (ACA) Tax. The Health Insurance Tax was permanently repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021. The permanent repeal of the tax impacts year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations. 16 Table of Contents SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS The following summarizes select third quarter 2021 year-over-year operating comparisons to third quarter 2020. • Consolidated revenues grew 11%, UnitedHealthcare revenues grew 11% and Optum revenues grew 14%. • UnitedHealthcare served 2.0 million more people domestically, driven by growth in community and senior programs. • Earnings from operations increased at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. • Diluted earnings per common share were $4.28. • Cash flows from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were $19.1 billion. • Return on equity was 23.5%.

Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased as a result of growth in people served through Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and commercial offerings, as well as increased COVID-19 related care costs and medical cost trends, partially offset by higher temporary care deferrals. The MCR increased due to the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax and increased COVID-19 related care costs, partially offset by increased deferral of care. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, medical costs and the MCR were also impacted by increased prior year favorable reserve development. Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio decreased primarily due to the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax and operating efficiency gains, partially offset by business mix. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the operating cost ratio also decreased due to COVID-19 impacts on revenue and operating costs in the prior year. Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the permanent repeal of the nondeductible Health Insurance Tax. Reportable Segments See Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by OptumHealth and adjusted scripts for OptumRx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, customer penetration and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment. 18 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: Three Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 Revenues UnitedHealthcare $ 55,927 $ 50,373 $ 5,554 11 % $ 166,515 $ 150,548 $ 15,967 11 % OptumHealth 13,812 10,499 3,313 32 39,515 28,830 10,685 37 OptumInsight 3,139 2,767 372 13 8,948 7,893 1,055 13 OptumRx 23,337 22,081 1,256 6 67,465 65,009 2,456 4 Optum eliminations (503) (424) (79) 19 (1,456) (1,275) (181) 14 Optum 39,785 34,923 4,862 14 114,472 100,457 14,015 14 Eliminations (23,375) (20,181) (3,194) 16 (67,133) (59,331) (7,802) 13 Consolidated revenues $ 72,337 $ 65,115 $ 7,222 11 % $ 213,854 $ 191,674 $ 22,180 12 % Earnings from operations UnitedHealthcare $ 2,651 $ 2,068 $ 583 28 % $ 9,854 $ 11,963 $ (2,109) (18) % OptumHealth 1,143 835 308 37 3,233 2,388 845 35 OptumInsight 906 785 121 15 2,447 1,882 565 30 OptumRx 1,012 963 49 5 2,895 2,655 240 9 Optum 3,061 2,583 478 19 8,575 6,925 1,650 24 Consolidated earnings from operations $ 5,712 $ 4,651 $ 1,061 23 % $ 18,429 $ 18,888 $ (459) (2) % Operating margin UnitedHealthcare 4.7 % 4.1 % 0.6 % 5.9 % 7.9 % (2.0) % OptumHealth 8.3 8.0 0.3 8.2 8.3 (0.1) OptumInsight 28.9 28.4 0.5 27.3 23.8 3.5 OptumRx 4.3 4.4 (0.1) 4.3 4.1 0.2 Optum 7.7 7.4 0.3 7.5 6.9 0.6 Consolidated operating margin 7.9 % 7.1 % 0.8 % 8.6 % 9.9 % (1.3) % UnitedHealthcare The following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: Three Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual $ 15,094 $ 14,081 $ 1,013 7 % $ 44,668 $ 41,324 $ 3,344 8 % UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement 24,931 22,606 2,325 10 75,709 68,613 7,096 10 UnitedHealthcare Community & State 13,763 11,820 1,943 16 39,846 34,796 5,050 15 UnitedHealthcare Global 2,139 1,866 273 15 6,292 5,815 477 8 Total UnitedHealthcare revenues $ 55,927 $ 50,373 $ 5,554 11 % $ 166,515 $ 150,548 $ 15,967 11 % 19 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: September 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in thousands, except percentages) 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 Commercial: Risk-based 7,960 7,950 10 — % Fee-based 18,595 18,400 195 1 Total commercial 26,555 26,350 205 1 Medicare Advantage 6,455 5,670 785 14 Medicaid 7,510 6,435 1,075 17 Medicare Supplement (Standardized) 4,405 4,450 (45) (1) Total community and senior 18,370 16,555 1,815 11 Total UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical 44,925 42,905 2,020 5 Global 5,490 5,285 205 4 Total UnitedHealthcare - medical 50,415 48,190 2,225 5 % Supplemental Data: Medicare Part D stand-alone 3,725 4,075 (350) (9) % Commercial business increased primarily due to acquisitions in risk-based and fee-based offerings. Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and group Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements due to COVID-19, new state-based awards and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans. UnitedHealthcare’s revenue increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, including a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs, and an increase in the number of individuals served through commercial benefits, partially offset by the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business. Earnings from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2021 increased primarily due to the higher temporary deferral of care and growth in people served across our domestic businesses, partially offset by COVID-19 related care costs and other economic factors. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, earnings from operations decreased due to COVID-19 related care costs and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business, partially offset by higher temporary deferral of care and growth in people served across our domestic businesses. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue at OptumHealth increased primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in care delivery and the impact of COVID-19 at our fee-based businesses as consumers resumed elective care. Earnings from operations increased due to organic growth and acquisitions and cost management initiatives. COVID-19 related care costs and temporary care deferrals affected earnings from operations at our risk-based and fee-based businesses in offsetting manners. OptumHealth served approximately 99 million people as of September 30, 2021 compared to 98 million people as of September 30, 2020. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased due to growth in technology and managed services and increased activity levels in our volume-based services as a result of care activity normalizing for payer and care provider clients. Earnings from operations also increased due to productivity gains and cost management initiatives. OptumRx Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic growth in pharmacy care services. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 also increased due to acquisitions. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain management initiatives. OptumRx fulfilled 344 million and 325 million adjusted scripts in the third quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition to the factors contributing to revenue growth, adjusted scripts also increased due to the dispensing of COVID-19 vaccines. 20 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 19,125 $ 16,073 $ 3,052 Issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net of repayments 3,733 2,941 792 Proceeds from common stock issuances 1,077 1,206 (129) Customer funds administered 1,402 249 1,153 Total sources of cash 25,337 20,469 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (3,950) (2,541) (1,409) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (4,727) (4,326) (401) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (3,702) (1,386) (2,316) Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (1,759) (1,477) (282) Cash dividends paid (3,915) (3,400) (515) Purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests (1,338) — (1,338) Other (1,737) (614) (1,123) Total uses of cash (21,128) (13,744) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (45) (160) 115 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 4,164 $ 6,565 $ (2,401) 2021 Cash Flows Compared to 2020 Cash Flows Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net purchases of investments, increased share repurchases and purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests, partially offset by increased customer funds administered. Financial Condition As of September 30, 2021, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $66.8 billion included approximately $21.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $3.7 billion was available for general corporate use), $42.8 billion of debt securities and $2.9 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.8 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of September 30, 2021. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Cash Requirements. A summary of our cash requirements as of December 31, 2020 was disclosed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2020 10-K. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs. We continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions. 21 Table of Contents Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in our 2020 10-K. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of September 30, 2021, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 38%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in our 2020 10-K. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of September 30, 2021 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Stable A+ Stable A Stable A- Positive Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1 n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we repurchased approximately 10 million shares at an average price of $376.93 per share. As of September 30, 2021, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 48 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In June 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.80 compared to $5.00 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Pending Acquisitions. We have entered into agreements to purchase companies in the health care sector, most notably Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG), subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $9 billion. For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2020 10-K. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS There are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2020 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in our 2020 10-K. 22 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities law. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; cyberattacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; risks and uncertainties associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; our ability to contract on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives; the impact of potential changes in tax laws and regulations (including any increase in the U.S. income tax rate applicable to corporations); failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of strategic transactions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; downgrades in our credit ratings; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of September 30, 2021 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): September 30, 2021 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 496 $ 171 $ (3,245) $ (8,646) 1 248 85 (1,639) (4,711) (1) (85) (7) 1,310 5,525 (2) (85) (7) 1,723 11,273 Note: Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2021, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense, as the rates are assumed not to fall below zero. As of September 30, 2021 some of our investments had interest rates below 1% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2021. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2021. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS A description of our legal proceedings is included in and incorporated by reference to Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 2020 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2020 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in our 2020 10-K. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the third quarter 2021, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares at an average price of $414.23 per share. As of September 30, 2021, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 48 million shares of our common stock. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 6.

Statements (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and “the Company”) is a diversified health care company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access, affordability, experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 as filed with the SEC (2020 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. Use of Estimates These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. 7 Table of Contents 2. Investments A summary of debt securities by major security type is as follows: (in millions) Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value June 30, 2021 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 3,526 $ 88 $ ( 17 ) $ 3,597 State and municipal obligations 7,044 386 ( 7 ) 7,423 Corporate obligations 21,116 628 ( 57 ) 21,687 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,596 167 ( 30 ) 6,733 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,623 72 ( 10 ) 2,685 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 40,905 1,341 ( 121 ) 42,125 Debt securities - held-to-maturity: U.S. government and agency obligations 412 4 — 416 State and municipal obligations 30 2 — 32 Corporate obligations 148 — ( 1 ) 147 Total debt securities - held-to-maturity 590 6 ( 1 ) 595 Total debt securities $ 41,495 $ 1,347 $ ( 122 ) $ 42,720 December 31, 2020 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 3,335 $ 133 $ ( 3 ) $ 3,465 State and municipal obligations 6,893 435 — 7,328 Corporate obligations 18,886 863 ( 12 ) 19,737 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,849 245 ( 3 ) 7,091 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,116 95 ( 4 ) 2,207 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 38,079 1,771 ( 22 ) 39,828 Debt securities - held-to-maturity: U.S. government and agency obligations 420 6 — 426 State and municipal obligations 31 2 — 33 Corporate obligations 187 1 — 188 Total debt securities - held-to-maturity 638 9 — 647 Total debt securities $ 38,717 $ 1,780 $ ( 22 ) $ 40,475 The Company held $ 2.8 billion and $ 2.3 billion of equity securities as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments, shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds with readily determinable fair values and other venture investments. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.3 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was not material. 8 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of June 30, 2021, by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 2,808 $ 2,822 $ 309 $ 310 Due after one year through five years 13,088 13,460 231 233 Due after five years through ten years 11,550 12,000 28 29 Due after ten years 4,240 4,425 22 23 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,596 6,733 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,623 2,685 — — Total debt securities $ 40,905 $ 42,125 $ 590 $ 595 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses June 30, 2021 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 1,201 $ ( 17 ) $ — $ — $ 1,201 $ ( 17 ) State and municipal obligations 777 ( 7 ) — — 777 ( 7 ) Corporate obligations 4,679 ( 56 ) 229 ( 1 ) 4,908 ( 57 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,668 ( 30 ) — — 2,668 ( 30 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 713 ( 8 ) 42 ( 2 ) 755 ( 10 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 10,038 $ ( 118 ) $ 271 $ ( 3 ) $ 10,309 $ ( 121 ) December 31, 2020 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 346 $ ( 3 ) $ — $ — $ 346 $ ( 3 ) Corporate obligations 1,273 ( 9 ) 456 ( 3 ) 1,729 ( 12 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 601 ( 3 ) — — 601 ( 3 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 195 ( 1 ) 93 ( 3 ) 288 ( 4 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 2,415 $ ( 16 ) $ 549 $ ( 6 ) $ 2,964 $ ( 22 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of June 30, 2021 were generated from approximately 6,500 positions out of a total of 38,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities that impacted our assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of June 30, 2021, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was not material. 9 Table of Contents 3. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in the 2020 10-K. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value June 30, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 19,703 $ 129 $ — $ 19,832 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,379 218 — 3,597 State and municipal obligations — 7,423 — 7,423 Corporate obligations 40 21,416 231 21,687 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 6,733 — 6,733 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,685 — 2,685 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,419 38,475 231 42,125 Equity securities 1,917 20 — 1,937 Assets under management 1,803 2,292 103 4,198 Total assets at fair value $ 26,842 $ 40,916 $ 334 $ 68,092 Percentage of total assets at fair value 39 % 60 % 1 % 100 % December 31, 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 16,841 $ 80 $ — $ 16,921 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,241 224 — 3,465 State and municipal obligations — 7,328 — 7,328 Corporate obligations 25 19,424 288 19,737 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 7,091 — 7,091 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,207 — 2,207 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,266 36,274 288 39,828 Equity securities 1,795 33 — 1,828 Assets under management 1,774 2,250 52 4,076 Total assets at fair value $ 23,676 $ 38,637 $ 340 $ 62,653 Percentage of total assets at fair value 38 % 61 % 1 % 100 % There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the six months ended June 30, 2021 or 2020. 10 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value June 30, 2021 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 494 $ 93 $ 8 $ 595 $ 590 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 54,023 $ — $ 54,023 $ 47,091 December 31, 2020 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 466 $ 108 $ 73 $ 647 $ 638 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 51,254 $ — $ 51,254 $ 42,171 Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during either the six months ended June 30, 2021 or 2020. 4. Medical Costs Payable The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the six months ended June 30: (in millions) 2021 2020 Medical costs payable, beginning of period $ 21,872 $ 21,690 Acquisitions 46 41 Reported medical costs: Current year 92,570 76,338 Prior years ( 1,120 ) ( 660 ) Total reported medical costs 91,450 75,678 Medical payments: Payments for current year ( 69,808 ) ( 59,482 ) Payments for prior years ( 18,429 ) ( 18,727 ) Total medical payments ( 88,237 ) ( 78,209 ) Medical costs payable, end of period $ 25,131 $ 19,200 For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, prior years medical cost reserve development was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization. Medical costs payable included reserves for claims incurred by insured customers but not yet reported to the Company of $ 16.9 billion and $ 14.8 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 5. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt In May 2021, the Company issued $ 7.0 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of the following: (in millions, except percentages) Par Value 0.550 % notes due May 2024 $ 1,000 1.150 % notes due May 2026 1,000 2.300 % notes due May 2031 1,500 3.050 % notes due May 2041 1,500 3.250 % notes due May 2051 2,000 For more information on the Company’s short-term borrowings, debt covenants and long-term debt see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in the 2020 10-K. 11 Table of Contents 6. Dividends In June 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.80 compared to $5.00 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2020. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The following table provides details of the Company’s 2021 dividend payments: Payment Date Amount per Share Total Amount Paid (in millions) March 23 $ 1.25 $ 1,181 June 29 $ 1.45 $ 1,367 7. Commitments and Contingencies Pending Acquisitions The Company has entered into agreements to purchase companies in the health care sector, most notably Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG), subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $ 9 billion. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status. 12 Table of Contents 8.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and with our 2020 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in that report. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the terms “UnitedHealth Group,” “we,” “our” or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 2, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2020 10-K and in the discussion below. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access, affordability, experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, Optum and UnitedHealthcare: • OptumHealth; • OptumInsight; • OptumRx; and • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2020 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. COVID-19 Trends and Uncertainties The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain. Overall care activity approached seasonal baselines, including a mix of temporary deferral of care activity and COVID-19 related care costs. The temporary deferral of care was more than offset by COVID-19 related care and testing costs, rebate requirements, and general economic impacts, such as impacts of unemployment. In future periods, care patterns may moderately exceed normal baselines as previously deferred care is obtained and acuity temporarily rises due to missed regular care. From time to time, health system capacity may be subject to possible increased volatility due to the pandemic. Specific trends and uncertainties related to our two business platforms are as follows: Optum. COVID-19 related care costs continued to impact our OptumHealth risk-based care delivery businesses, which were partially offset by the continued temporary deferral of care. The temporary deferral of care reduced fee-for-service care delivery volume, as well as OptumInsight and OptumRx volume-based business activity, although we expect the impact to continue decreasing as care returns to, and potentially exceeds, normal levels. We believe COVID-19 will continue to influence customer and consumer behavior, both during and after the pandemic, which could impact how and where care is delivered and the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services. We expect COVID-19 related care costs and other economic impacts to be only partially offset by remaining temporary deferrals of care in the second half of the year as health systems return to seasonally adjusted levels of care. As a result of the dynamic situation and broad-reaching impact to the health system, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our Optum businesses is uncertain. 15 Table of Contents UnitedHealthcare. In 2021, we have continued expanded benefit coverage in areas such as COVID-19 related care and testing, telemedicine, and pharmacy; continuing to assist our customers, care providers, members and communities in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. UnitedHealthcare’s results of operations were negatively impacted by COVID-19 related care and testing, rebate requirements and other revenue impacts and broader economic impacts, partially offset by the continued deferral of care. Enrollment in our commercial products declined primarily due to employer actions in response to the pandemic, while the increase in people served through Medicaid was attributable in part to continuing action by states to ease redetermination requirements due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. Increased consumer demand for care, potentially even higher acuity care, along with continued COVID-19 related care costs are expected to result in increased future medical costs in the second half of the year. Disrupted care patterns, as a result of the pandemic, have and may continue to temporarily affect the ability to obtain complete member health status information, impacting revenue in businesses utilizing risk adjustment methodologies. The ultimate overall impact is uncertain and dependent on the future pacing and intensity of the pandemic, the duration of policies and initiatives to address COVID-19, and general economic uncertainty. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South American and certain other international health markets. Overall spending on health care is impacted by inflation; utilization; medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement; regulatory requirements; demographic trends in the population; and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions, such as the impacts of COVID-19, and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any potential impacts from COVID-19. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. Government programs in the community and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. COVID-19 related care costs as well as the deferral of care have also impacted medical cost trends in the current year and may continue in future years. Future medical cost trends may be impacted by increased consumer demand for care, potentially even higher acuity care, due to the temporary deferral of care since the onset of the pandemic. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care. The continued uncertain impact of COVID-19 may impact our ability to estimate medical costs payable, which has resulted in, and could result in, increased variability to medical cost reserve development. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of management’s view of regulatory trends and uncertainties. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation,” Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2020 10-K. Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2022 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 4.1%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend. We continue to manage costs through improving and expanding our coordinated care models, value-based care arrangements and various consumer engagement tools. Affordable Care Act (ACA) Tax. The Health Insurance Tax was permanently repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021. The permanent repeal of the tax impacts year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations. 16 Table of Contents SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS The following summarizes select second quarter 2021 year-over-year operating comparisons to second quarter 2020. • Consolidated revenues grew 15%, UnitedHealthcare revenues grew 13% and Optum revenues grew 17%. • UnitedHealthcare served 1.1 million more people domestically, driven by growth in community and senior programs, partially offset a decrease in people served by our commercial business. • Consolidated and UnitedHealthcare earnings from operations decreased due to lower temporary deferrals of care caused by COVID-19, partially offset by an increase at Optum. • Diluted earnings per common share were $4.46. • Cash flows from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2021 were $11.5 billion. • Return on equity was 25.2%.

The increases partially offset a decrease in individuals served through our commercial business due to the continued economic impacts of COVID-19. Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased as a result of increased COVID-19 related care costs, lower temporary care deferrals, growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid and medical cost trends, partially offset by decreased people served in our commercial business. The MCR increased due to increased COVID-19 related care costs and the decreased deferral of care over the year ago quarter and the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, medical costs and the MCR were also impacted by increased prior year favorable reserve development. Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio decreased primarily due to the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax, COVID-19 impacts on revenue and operating costs in the prior year and operating efficiency gains, partially offset by business mix. Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the permanent repeal of the nondeductible Health Insurance Tax. Reportable Segments See Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by OptumHealth and adjusted scripts for OptumRx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, customer penetration and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment. 18 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: Three Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 Revenues UnitedHealthcare $ 55,474 $ 49,107 $ 6,367 13 % $ 110,588 $ 100,175 $ 10,413 10 % OptumHealth 13,300 9,139 4,161 46 25,703 18,331 7,372 40 OptumInsight 2,957 2,632 325 12 5,809 5,126 683 13 OptumRx 22,524 21,371 1,153 5 44,128 42,928 1,200 3 Optum eliminations (478) (447) (31) 7 (953) (851) (102) 12 Optum 38,303 32,695 5,608 17 74,687 65,534 9,153 14 Eliminations (22,456) (19,664) (2,792) 14 (43,758) (39,150) (4,608) 12 Consolidated revenues $ 71,321 $ 62,138 $ 9,183 15 % $ 141,517 $ 126,559 $ 14,958 12 % Earnings from operations UnitedHealthcare $ 3,095 $ 7,007 $ (3,912) (56) % $ 7,203 $ 9,895 $ (2,692) (27) % OptumHealth 1,128 841 287 34 2,090 1,553 537 35 OptumInsight 762 561 201 36 1,541 1,097 444 40 OptumRx 993 832 161 19 1,883 1,692 191 11 Optum 2,883 2,234 649 29 5,514 4,342 1,172 27 Consolidated earnings from operations $ 5,978 $ 9,241 $ (3,263) (35) % $ 12,717 $ 14,237 $ (1,520) (11) % Operating margin UnitedHealthcare 5.6 % 14.3 % (8.7) % 6.5 % 9.9 % (3.4) % OptumHealth 8.5 9.2 (0.7) 8.1 8.5 (0.4) OptumInsight 25.8 21.3 4.5 26.5 21.4 5.1 OptumRx 4.4 3.9 0.5 4.3 3.9 0.4 Optum 7.5 6.8 0.7 7.4 6.6 0.8 Consolidated operating margin 8.4 % 14.9 % (6.5) % 9.0 % 11.2 % (2.2) % UnitedHealthcare The following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: Three Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual $ 14,942 $ 12,963 $ 1,979 15 % $ 29,574 $ 27,243 $ 2,331 9 % UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement 25,304 22,855 2,449 11 50,778 46,007 4,771 10 UnitedHealthcare Community & State 13,110 11,523 1,587 14 26,083 22,976 3,107 14 UnitedHealthcare Global 2,118 1,766 352 20 4,153 3,949 204 5 Total UnitedHealthcare revenues $ 55,474 $ 49,107 $ 6,367 13 % $ 110,588 $ 100,175 $ 10,413 10 % 19 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: June 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in thousands, except percentages) 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 Commercial: Risk-based 7,840 8,065 (225) (3) % Fee-based 18,395 18,705 (310) (2) Total commercial 26,235 26,770 (535) (2) Medicare Advantage 6,385 5,605 780 14 Medicaid 7,130 6,210 920 15 Medicare Supplement (Standardized) 4,390 4,450 (60) (1) Total community and senior 17,905 16,265 1,640 10 Total UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical 44,140 43,035 1,105 3 Global 5,485 5,365 120 2 Total UnitedHealthcare - medical 49,625 48,400 1,225 3 % Supplemental Data: Medicare Part D stand-alone 3,750 4,120 (370) (9) % Commercial business decreased primarily due to increased unemployment. Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and group Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements due to COVID-19, new state-based awards and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans. UnitedHealthcare’s revenue increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid and a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through commercial benefits, the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business. Earnings from operations for the three months ended June 30, 2021 decreased primarily due to the lower temporary deferral of care. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, earnings from operations decreased due to COVID-19 related care costs, reduction in people served through commercial benefits and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business, partially offset by growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid and the repeal of the Health Insurance Tax. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue at OptumHealth increased primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in care delivery and the impact of COVID-19 at our fee-based businesses as consumers resumed elective care. Earnings from operations increased due to organic growth and acquisitions and cost management initiatives. COVID-19 related care costs and temporary care deferrals affected earnings from operations at our risk-based and fee-based businesses in offsetting manners. OptumHealth served approximately 99 million people as of June 30, 2021 compared to 97 million people as of June 30, 2020. OptumInsight Revenue at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in technology and managed services and increased activity levels in our volume-based services as a result of care activity normalizing for payer and care provider clients. Earnings from operations increased primarily due to productivity gains and cost management initiatives, as well as the factors impacting revenue. OptumRx Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased due to higher script volumes, pricing trends and organic growth in pharmacy care services. Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2021 also increased due to acquisitions. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain management initiatives. OptumRx fulfilled 342 million and 316 million adjusted scripts in the second quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase was due to the continued recovery of script volumes from the second quarter of 2020 where volumes were negatively impacted by COVID-19, dispensing of COVID-19 vaccines and organic growth. 20 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 11,545 $ 12,946 $ (1,401) Issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net of repayments 4,858 5,215 (357) Proceeds from common stock issuances 764 870 (106) Customer funds administered 2,395 1,263 1,132 Sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases — 573 (573) Total sources of cash 19,562 20,867 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (2,900) (1,691) (1,209) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (4,642) (3,952) (690) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (2,789) — (2,789) Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (1,130) (920) (210) Cash dividends paid (2,548) (2,212) (336) Purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests (1,338) — (1,338) Other (1,310) (607) (703) Total uses of cash (16,657) (9,382) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 6 (143) 149 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 2,911 $ 11,342 $ (8,431) 2021 Cash Flows Compared to 2020 Cash Flows Decreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by decreased net earnings due to the lower temporary deferral of care, the timing of prior year federal income tax payments and changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net purchases of investments, purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests and increased share repurchases, partially offset by increased customer funds administered. Financial Condition As of June 30, 2021, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $64.7 billion included approximately $19.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.5 billion was available for general corporate use), $42.1 billion of debt securities and $2.8 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.8 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of June 30, 2021. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Cash Requirements. A summary of our cash requirements as of December 31, 2020 was disclosed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2020 10-K. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs. We continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions. 21 Table of Contents Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in our 2020 10-K. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of June 30, 2021, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 39%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in our 2020 10-K. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of June 30, 2021 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Stable A+ Stable A Stable A- Positive Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1 n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, we repurchased approximately 8 million shares at an average price of $365.03 per share. As of June 30, 2021, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 50 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In June 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.80 compared to $5.00 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 6 of Notes t o the Condensed Consolidated Fi nancial St atements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Pending Acquisitions. The Company has entered into agreements to purchase companies in the health care sector, most notably Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG), subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $9 billion. For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2020 10-K. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS There are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2020 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in our 2020 10-K. 22 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities law. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; cyberattacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; risks and uncertainties associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; our ability to contract on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives; the impact of potential changes in tax laws and regulations (including any increase in the U.S. income tax rate applicable to corporations); failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of strategic transactions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; downgrades in our credit ratings; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of June 30, 2021 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): June 30, 2021 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum (a) Interest Expense Per Annum (a) Fair Value of Financial Assets (b) Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 472 $ 204 $ (3,200) $ (8,864) 1 236 102 (1,615) (4,831) (1) (88) (10) 1,222 5,640 (2) (88) (10) 1,555 11,426 Note: Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2021, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense, as the rates are assumed not to fall below zero. As of June 30, 2021 some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2021. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2021. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS A description of our legal proceedings is included in and incorporated by reference to Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 2020 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2020 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in our 2020 10-K. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the second quarter 2021, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares at an average price of $394.60 per share. As of June 30, 2021, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 50 million shares of our common stock. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 6.

Statements 5 Table of Contents UnitedHealth Group Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and “the Company”) is a diversified health care company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two complementary business platforms — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access, affordability, experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 as filed with the SEC (2020 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. Use of Estimates These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. 6 Table of Contents 2.

The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments and shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.3 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector for both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was not material. 7 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of March 31, 2021, by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 3,037 $ 3,053 $ 354 $ 355 Due after one year through five years 12,571 12,922 238 242 Due after five years through ten years 10,945 11,263 25 26 Due after ten years 4,155 4,264 22 23 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,784 6,921 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,382 2,429 — — Total debt securities $ 39,874 $ 40,852 $ 639 $ 646 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses March 31, 2021 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 924 $ ( 26 ) $ — $ — $ 924 $ ( 26 ) State and municipal obligations 1,141 ( 22 ) 3 — 1,144 ( 22 ) Corporate obligations 5,266 ( 120 ) 367 ( 2 ) 5,633 ( 122 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,552 ( 48 ) 1 — 2,553 ( 48 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 650 ( 17 ) 77 ( 2 ) 727 ( 19 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 10,533 $ ( 233 ) $ 448 $ ( 4 ) $ 10,981 $ ( 237 ) December 31, 2020 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 346 $ ( 3 ) $ — $ — $ 346 $ ( 3 ) Corporate obligations 1,273 ( 9 ) 456 ( 3 ) 1,729 ( 12 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 601 ( 3 ) — — 601 ( 3 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 195 ( 1 ) 93 ( 3 ) 288 ( 4 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 2,415 $ ( 16 ) $ 549 $ ( 6 ) $ 2,964 $ ( 22 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of March 31, 2021 were generated from approximately 8,000 positions out of a total of 37,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities that impacted our assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of March 31, 2021, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was not material. 8 Table of Contents 3. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2020 10-K. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value March 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 19,880 $ 75 $ — $ 19,955 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,208 224 — 3,432 State and municipal obligations — 7,264 — 7,264 Corporate obligations 29 20,497 280 20,806 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 6,921 — 6,921 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,429 — 2,429 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,237 37,335 280 40,852 Equity securities 1,975 27 — 2,002 Assets under management 1,753 2,286 55 4,094 Total assets at fair value $ 26,845 $ 39,723 $ 335 $ 66,903 Percentage of total assets at fair value 40 % 59 % 1 % 100 % December 31, 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 16,841 $ 80 $ — $ 16,921 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,241 224 — 3,465 State and municipal obligations — 7,328 — 7,328 Corporate obligations 25 19,424 288 19,737 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 7,091 — 7,091 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,207 — 2,207 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,266 36,274 288 39,828 Equity securities 1,795 33 — 1,828 Assets under management 1,774 2,250 52 4,076 Total assets at fair value $ 23,676 $ 38,637 $ 340 $ 62,653 Percentage of total assets at fair value 38 % 61 % 1 % 100 % There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2021 or 2020. 9 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value March 31, 2021 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 463 $ 110 $ 73 $ 646 $ 639 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 46,315 $ — $ 46,315 $ 40,903 December 31, 2020 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 466 $ 108 $ 73 $ 647 $ 638 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 51,254 $ — $ 51,254 $ 42,171 Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during either the three months ended March 31, 2021 or 2020. 4. Medical Costs Payable The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the three months ended March 31: (in millions) 2021 2020 Medical costs payable, beginning of period $ 21,872 $ 21,690 Acquisitions 12 — Reported medical costs: Current year 45,914 41,580 Prior years ( 1,010 ) ( 580 ) Total reported medical costs 44,904 41,000 Medical payments: Payments for current year ( 25,960 ) ( 23,471 ) Payments for prior years ( 15,995 ) ( 16,447 ) Total medical payments ( 41,955 ) ( 39,918 ) Medical costs payable, end of period $ 24,833 $ 22,772 For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, prior years medical cost reserve development was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization. Medical costs payable included reserves for claims incurred by insured customers but not yet reported to the Company of $ 16.3 billion and $ 14.8 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 10 Table of Contents 5.

Short-Term Borrowings Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers. As of March 31, 2021, the Company’s outstanding commercial paper had a weighted average annual interest rate of 0.2 %. The Company has $ 4.4 billion five-year, $ 4.4 billion three-year and $ 3.8 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 26 banks, which mature in December 2025, December 2023 and December 2021, respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2021, no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Company’s senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of March 31, 2021, annual interest rates would have ranged from 0.8 % to 0.9 %. Debt Covenants The Company’s bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring the Company to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of March 31, 2021. 6. Commitments and Contingencies Pending Acquisitions The Company has entered into agreements to purchase companies in the health care sector, most notably Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG), which is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $ 12 billion. Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. 12 Table of Contents On February 14, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status. 7.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the terms “UnitedHealth Group,” “we,” “our” or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 2, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2020 10-K and in the discussion below. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access, affordability, experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, Optum and UnitedHealthcare: • OptumHealth; • OptumInsight; • OptumRx; and • UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2020 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. COVID-19 Trends and Uncertainties The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, overall care activity, including COVID-19 related care, was nearly at seasonal baselines. This was primarily the result of temporary deferral of elective care activity, which generally tracked with COVID-19 incidence rates during the quarter. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the temporary deferral of care was more than offset by COVID-19 related care and testing costs, rebate requirements, and general economic impacts, such as impacts of unemployment. The temporary deferral of care, along with continued COVID-19 related care costs, may cause care patterns to moderately exceed normal baselines in future periods as utilization of health system capacity increases and consumers resume elective care. From time to time, health system capacity may be subject to possible increased volatility due to the pandemic. Specific trends and uncertainties related to our two business platforms are as follows: Optum. COVID-19 related care costs continued to impact our OptumHealth risk-based care delivery businesses, which were partially offset by the continued temporary deferral of care. The temporary deferral of care reduced fee-for-service care delivery volume, as well as OptumInsight and OptumRx volume-based business activity. We believe COVID-19 will continue to influence customer and consumer behavior, both during and after the pandemic, which could impact how care is delivered and the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services. We expect COVID-19 related care costs and other economic impacts to only partially be offset by temporary deferrals of care in the second half of the year as health systems return to seasonally adjusted levels of care. As a result of the dynamic situation and broad-reaching impact to the health system, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our Optum businesses is uncertain. 14 Table of Contents UnitedHealthcare. In 2021, we have continued expanded benefit coverage in areas such as COVID-19 related care and testing, telemedicine, and pharmacy; continuing to assist our customers, care providers, members and communities in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. Temporary care deferrals continued to impact UnitedHealthcare’s results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021, offset by COVID-19 related care and testing, rebate requirements and other revenue impacts and broader economic impacts. Enrollment in our commercial products declined primarily due to employer actions in response to the pandemic. Increased consumer demand for care, potentially even higher acuity care, along with continued COVID-19 related care and testing costs are expected to result in increased future medical costs in the second half of the year. Disrupted care patterns, as a result of the pandemic, have and may continue to temporarily affect the ability to obtain complete member health status information, impacting revenue in businesses utilizing risk adjustment methodologies. The ultimate overall impact is uncertain and dependent on the future pacing and intensity of the pandemic, the duration of policies and initiatives to address COVID-19, and general economic uncertainty. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South American and certain other international health markets. Overall spending on health care is impacted by inflation; utilization; medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement; regulatory requirements; demographic trends in the population; and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions, such as the impacts of COVID-19, and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any potential impacts from COVID-19. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. Government programs in the community and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. COVID-19 related care and testing costs as well as the deferral of care have also impacted medical cost trends in the current year and may continue in future years. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care. The continued uncertain impact of COVID-19 may impact our ability to estimate medical costs payable, which has resulted in, and could result in, increased variability to medical cost reserve development. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of management’s view of regulatory trends and uncertainties. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation,” Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2020 10-K and “ Risk Factors ” in Part II, Item 1A of this report. Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2022 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 4.1%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend. We continue to manage costs through improving and expanding our coordinated care models, value-based care arrangements and various consumer engagement tools. Affordable Care Act (ACA) Tax. The Health Insurance Tax was permanently repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021. The permanent repeal of the tax impacts year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations. 15 Table of Contents SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS The following summarizes select first quarter 2021 year-over-year operating comparisons to first quarter 2020. • Consolidated revenues grew 9%, UnitedHealthcare revenues grew 8% and Optum revenues grew 11%. • UnitedHealthcare served 1.1 million more people domestically, driven by growth in community and senior programs, partially offset by decreased people served by our commercial benefits business. • Consolidated earnings from operations increased 35%, including increases of 42% at UnitedHealthcare and 25% at Optum. • Diluted earnings per common share increased 44% to $5.08. • Cash flows from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $6.0 billion. • Return on equity was 29.5%. RESULTS SUMMARY The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information: (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 Revenues: Premiums $ 55,486 $ 50,640 $ 4,846 10 % Products 8,340 8,431 (91) (1) Services 5,918 4,985 933 19 Investment and other income 452 365 87 24 Total revenues 70,196 64,421 5,775 9 Operating costs: Medical costs 44,904 41,000 3,904 10 Operating costs 10,223 10,015 208 2 Cost of products sold 7,572 7,687 (115) (1) Depreciation and amortization 758 723 35 5 Total operating costs 63,457 59,425 4,032 7 Earnings from operations 6,739 4,996 1,743 35 Interest expense (397) (437) 40 (9) Earnings before income taxes 6,342 4,559 1,783 39 Provision for income taxes (1,364) (1,094) (270) 25 Net earnings 4,978 3,465 1,513 44 Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (116) (83) (33) 40 Net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 4,862 $ 3,382 $ 1,480 44 % Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 5.08 $ 3.52 $ 1.56 44 % Medical care ratio (a) 80.9 % 81.0 % (0.1) % Operating cost ratio 14.6 15.5 (0.9) Operating margin 9.6 7.8 1.8 Tax rate 21.5 24.0 (2.5) Net earnings margin (b) 6.9 5.2 1.7 Return on equity (c) 29.5 % 23.6 % 5.9 % (a) Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.

(c) Return on equity is calculated as annualized net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders divided by average shareholders’ equity. Average shareholders’ equity is calculated using the shareholders’ equity balance at the end of the preceding year and the shareholders’ equity balances at the end of each of the quarters in the year presented. 16 Table of Contents 2021 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2020 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Financial Results Revenue The increases in revenue were primarily driven by the increase in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid; pricing trends; and organic and acquisition growth across the Optum business, primarily due to expansion in care delivery and managed services. The increases were partially offset by decreased individuals served through our commercial benefits business due to the continued economic impacts of COVID-19. Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased as a result of growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, medical cost trends and COVID-19 related care and testing costs, partially offset by the temporary deferral of care continued to be caused by COVID-19, decreased people served in commercial, increased prior year favorable reserve development and calendar day impacts. The MCR was stable due to the temporary deferral of care, increased prior year favorable reserve development and calendar day impacts, being offset by the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax and COVID-19 related care and testing costs. Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio decreased primarily due to the permanent repeal of the return of the Health Insurance Tax and operating efficiency gains, partially offset by business mix. Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the permanent repeal of the nondeductible Health Insurance Tax. Reportable Segments See Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by OptumHealth and adjusted scripts for OptumRx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, customer penetration and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment. 17 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 Revenues UnitedHealthcare $ 55,114 $ 51,068 $ 4,046 8 % OptumHealth 12,403 9,192 3,211 35 OptumInsight 2,852 2,494 358 14 OptumRx 21,604 21,557 47 — Optum eliminations (475) (404) (71) 18 Optum 36,384 32,839 3,545 11 Eliminations (21,302) (19,486) (1,816) 9 Consolidated revenues $ 70,196 $ 64,421 $ 5,775 9 % Earnings from operations UnitedHealthcare $ 4,108 $ 2,888 $ 1,220 42 % OptumHealth 962 712 250 35 OptumInsight 779 536 243 45 OptumRx 890 860 30 3 Optum 2,631 2,108 523 25 Consolidated earnings from operations $ 6,739 $ 4,996 $ 1,743 35 % Operating margin UnitedHealthcare 7.5 % 5.7 % 1.8 % OptumHealth 7.8 7.7 0.1 OptumInsight 27.3 21.5 5.8 OptumRx 4.1 4.0 0.1 Optum 7.2 6.4 0.8 Consolidated operating margin 9.6 % 7.8 % 1.8 % UnitedHealthcare The following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual $ 14,632 $ 14,280 $ 352 2 % UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement 25,474 23,152 2,322 10 UnitedHealthcare Community & State 12,973 11,453 1,520 13 UnitedHealthcare Global 2,035 2,183 (148) (7) Total UnitedHealthcare revenues $ 55,114 $ 51,068 $ 4,046 8 % 18 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in thousands, except percentages) 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 Commercial: Risk-based 7,860 8,215 (355) (4) % Fee-based 18,455 18,825 (370) (2) Total commercial 26,315 27,040 (725) (3) Medicare Advantage 6,335 5,575 760 14 Medicaid 6,975 5,880 1,095 19 Medicare Supplement (Standardized) 4,390 4,440 (50) (1) Total community and senior 17,700 15,895 1,805 11 Total UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical 44,015 42,935 1,080 3 Global 5,460 5,605 (145) (3) Total UnitedHealthcare - medical 49,475 48,540 935 2 % Supplemental Data: Medicare Part D stand-alone 3,795 4,150 (355) (9) % Fee-based and risk-based commercial business decreased primarily due to increased unemployment. Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and group Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements due to COVID-19, new state-based awards and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans. UnitedHealthcare’s revenue increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid and a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through commercial benefits and the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax. Earnings from operations increased due to the continued deferral of care caused by COVID-19 on the health system, the growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid and the repeal of the Health Insurance Tax, partially offset by COVID-19 related care and testing costs, the reduction in people served through commercial benefits and broader economic impacts of COVID-19. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth at OptumHealth and OptumInsight. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumHealth increased primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in care delivery. Earnings from operations were also impacted by the temporary deferral of care at our risk-based businesses caused by COVID-19 and cost management initiatives, partially offset by COVID-19 related care costs. OptumHealth served approximately 99 million people as of March 31, 2021 compared to 96 million people as of March 31, 2020. OptumInsight Revenue at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in technology and managed services, partially offset by decreased activity levels in volume-based services due to the impact of COVID-19 on payer and care provider clients. Earnings from operations increased primarily due to productivity gains and cost management initiatives, as well as the factors impacting revenue. OptumRx Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx grew modestly due to organic growth and acquisitions in pharmacy care services and pricing trends, offset by lower script volumes. OptumRx fulfilled 329 million and 339 million adjusted scripts in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively, as the first quarter 2020 included the advance provision of medications to people served in response to COVID-related supply concerns, with script levels then receding with care deferral patterns. 19 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 6,005 $ 2,943 $ 3,062 Issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net of repayments 2,907 10,797 (7,890) Proceeds from common stock issuances 436 557 (121) Customer funds administered 2,131 1,062 1,069 Sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases — 30 (30) Total sources of cash 11,479 15,389 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (1,650) (1,691) 41 Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (1,193) (929) (264) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (1,714) — (1,714) Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (568) (469) (99) Cash dividends paid (1,181) (1,024) (157) Other (2,088) (563) (1,525) Total uses of cash (8,394) (4,676) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (51) (129) 78 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,034 $ 10,584 $ (7,550) 2021 Cash Flows Compared to 2020 Cash Flows Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by increased net earnings and changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included decreased short-term borrowings and increased purchases of investments, partially offset by increased customer funds administered. Financial Condition As of March 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $63.4 billion included approximately $20.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $2.1 billion was available for general corporate use), $40.9 billion of debt securities and $2.6 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.8 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of March 31, 2021. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Cash Requirements. A summary of our cash requirements as of December 31, 2020 was disclosed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” in our 2020 10-K. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs. We continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions. 20 Table of Contents Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of March 31, 2021, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 39%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of March 31, 2021 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Stable A+ Stable A Stable A- Positive Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1 n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares at an average price of $345.42 per share. As of March 31, 2021, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 53 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. Our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders reflects an annual dividend rate of $5.00 per share. Pending Acquisitions. The Company has entered into agreements to purchase companies in the health care sector, most notably Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG), which is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $12 billion. For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2020 10-K. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS There are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2020 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” in our 2020 10-K. 21 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities law. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; cyberattacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; risks and uncertainties associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; our ability to contract on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives; the impact of potential changes in tax laws and regulations (including any increase in the U.S. income tax rate applicable to corporations); failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of strategic transactions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; downgrades in our credit ratings; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of March 31, 2021 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): March 31, 2021 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum (a) Interest Expense Per Annum (a) Fair Value of Financial Assets (b) Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 468 $ 245 $ (3,116) $ (7,467) 1 234 122 (1,576) (4,059) (1) (80) (14) 1,226 4,741 (2) (80) (14) 1,689 9,821 Note: Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2021, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense, as the rates are assumed not to fall below zero. As of March 31, 2021 and 2020, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2021. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2021. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS A description of our legal proceedings is included in and incorporated by reference to Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 2020 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2020 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in our 2020 10-K. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the first quarter 2021, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares at an average price of $345.42 per share. As of March 31, 2021, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 53 million shares of our common stock. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 6.

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 6 Table of Contents UnitedHealth Group Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and “the Company”) is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in data and health information, advanced technology and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 as filed with the SEC (2019 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. Use of Estimates These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenue from Products For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company recognized revenue and cost of products sold for retail pharmacy co-payments related to its OptumRx business. Revenue recognized in prior periods related to retail pharmacy transactions excludes the member’s applicable co-payment. There was no impact on earnings from operations, net earnings, earnings per share or total equity. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)” (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 requires the use of the current expected credit loss impairment model to develop an estimate of expected credit losses for certain financial assets. ASU 2016-13 also requires expected credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be recognized through an allowance for credit losses and revises certain disclosure requirements. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 using a cumulative effect upon adoption approach. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 was immaterial to the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, results of operations, equity and cash flows. Under the current expected credit loss impairment model, the Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security’s amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings. The Company has determined that there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 7 Table of Contents 2.

The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments and shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.4 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities at September 30, 2020 was not material. 8 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of September 30, 2020, by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 3,388 $ 3,407 $ 400 $ 401 Due after one year through five years 11,253 11,678 246 252 Due after five years through ten years 9,179 9,826 30 31 Due after ten years 4,326 4,511 22 24 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,523 6,790 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 2,033 2,125 — — Total debt securities $ 36,702 $ 38,337 $ 698 $ 708 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses September 30, 2020 Debt securities - available-for-sale: State and municipal obligations $ 366 $ ( 4 ) $ — $ — $ 366 $ ( 4 ) Corporate obligations 2,314 ( 30 ) 400 ( 5 ) 2,714 ( 35 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 687 ( 3 ) — — 687 ( 3 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 278 ( 3 ) 55 ( 3 ) 333 ( 6 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 3,645 $ ( 40 ) $ 455 $ ( 8 ) $ 4,100 $ ( 48 ) December 31, 2019 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 616 $ ( 4 ) $ — $ — $ 616 $ ( 4 ) State and municipal obligations 440 ( 5 ) — — 440 ( 5 ) Corporate obligations 1,903 ( 7 ) 740 ( 4 ) 2,643 ( 11 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 657 ( 3 ) 333 ( 3 ) 990 ( 6 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 406 ( 3 ) — — 406 ( 3 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 4,022 $ ( 22 ) $ 1,073 $ ( 7 ) $ 5,095 $ ( 29 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of September 30, 2020 were generated from approximately 3,000 positions out of a total of 34,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities that impacted our assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, and the potential economic impacts of COVID-19 on the issuers, noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of September 30, 2020, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at September 30, 2020 was not material. 9 Table of Contents 3. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2019 10-K. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value September 30, 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 17,472 $ 78 $ — $ 17,550 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,336 198 — 3,534 State and municipal obligations — 6,684 — 6,684 Corporate obligations 44 18,881 279 19,204 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 6,790 — 6,790 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 2,125 — 2,125 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,380 34,678 279 38,337 Equity securities 1,593 30 — 1,623 Assets under management 1,690 2,050 48 3,788 Total assets at fair value $ 24,135 $ 36,836 $ 327 $ 61,298 Percentage of total assets at fair value 39 % 60 % 1 % 100 % December 31, 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 10,837 $ 148 $ — $ 10,985 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,369 184 — 3,553 State and municipal obligations — 5,926 — 5,926 Corporate obligations 70 17,923 249 18,242 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 6,528 — 6,528 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 1,845 — 1,845 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,439 32,406 249 36,094 Equity securities 1,734 22 — 1,756 Assets under management 1,123 1,918 35 3,076 Total assets at fair value $ 17,133 $ 34,494 $ 284 $ 51,911 Percentage of total assets at fair value 33 % 66 % 1 % 100 % There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 or 2019. 10 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value September 30, 2020 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 531 $ 99 $ 78 $ 708 $ 698 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 51,785 $ — $ 51,785 $ 43,794 December 31, 2019 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 541 $ 181 $ 253 $ 975 $ 972 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 45,078 $ — $ 45,078 $ 40,278 Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during either the nine months ended September 30, 2020 or 2019. 4. Medical Costs Payable The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the nine months ended September 30: (in millions) 2020 2019 Medical costs payable, beginning of period $ 21,690 $ 19,891 Acquisitions 186 868 Reported medical costs: Current year 118,114 117,624 Prior years ( 800 ) ( 460 ) Total reported medical costs 117,314 117,164 Medical payments: Payments for current year ( 98,548 ) ( 99,487 ) Payments for prior years ( 19,475 ) ( 17,497 ) Total medical payments ( 118,023 ) ( 116,984 ) Medical costs payable, end of period $ 21,167 $ 20,939 For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, prior years medical cost reserve development was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the prior years medical cost reserve development included no individual factors that were significant. Medical costs payable included reserves for claims incurred by insured customers but not yet reported to the Company of $ 14.7 billion and $ 13.8 billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 11 Table of Contents 5.

Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers. The Company has $ 4.4 billion five-year, $ 4.4 billion three-year and $ 3.8 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 25 banks, which mature in December 2024, December 2022 and December 2020, respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2020, no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Company’s senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of September 30, 2020, annual interest rates would have ranged from 0.8 % to 1 %. Debt Covenants The Company’s bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring the Company to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of September 30, 2020. 6. Dividends In June 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.00 compared to $4.32 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2019. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The following table provides details of the Company’s 2020 dividend payments: Payment Date Amount per Share Total Amount Paid (in millions) March 24 $ 1.08 $ 1,024 June 30 1.25 1,188 September 22 1.25 1,188 7. Commitments and Contingencies Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including 13 Table of Contents for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status. 8.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and with our 2019 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in that report. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the terms “UnitedHealth Group,” “we,” “our” or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 2, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2019 10-K and in the discussion below. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise, focused on improving health outcomes, lowering health care costs and creating a better experience for patients, their caregivers and physicians. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2019 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. COVID-19 Trends and Uncertainties The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain and difficult to predict. During the second quarter, the global health system experienced unprecedented levels of care deferral, which impacted all of our businesses. As the pandemic advanced, access to and demand for care was most constrained from mid-March through April, began to recover in May and June and restored to near normal seasonal levels in the third quarter. The temporary deferral of care may cause care patterns to moderately exceed normal baselines in future periods as utilization of health system capacity continues to increase. From time to time, health system capacity may be subject to possible increased volatility due to the pandemic. Specific trends and uncertainties related to our two business platforms are as follows: UnitedHealthcare. We have expanded benefit coverage in areas such as COVID-19 care and testing, telemedicine, and pharmacy benefits; provided customers assistance in the form of co-pay waivers and premium forgiveness; offered additional enrollment opportunities to those who previously declined employer-sponsored offerings; extended certain premium payment terms for customers experiencing financial hardship; simplified administrative practices; and accelerated payments to care providers, all with the aim of assisting our customers, providers and members in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. Temporary care deferrals significantly impacted UnitedHealthcare’s results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, contributing to a lower medical care ratio and higher operating earnings than in previous periods. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, the impact of temporary care deferrals was more than offset by COVID-19 related care and testing, the significant financial assistance we continued to provide our customers and broader economic impacts. Enrollment in our commercial products declined primarily due to employer actions. Increased consumer demand for care, potentially even higher acuity care, along with continued COVID-19 care and testing costs are expected to result in increased future medical costs. Disrupted care patterns, as a result of the pandemic, may temporarily affect the ability to obtain complete member health status information, impacting future revenue in businesses that utilize risk adjustment methodologies. The ultimate overall impact is uncertain and dependent on the future pacing and intensity of the pandemic, the duration of policies and initiatives to address COVID-19, and the progress of an uncertain economic recovery. 16 Table of Contents Optum. The temporary deferral of care also meaningfully impacted the Optum businesses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. For example, our fee-for-service care delivery business, such as traditional procedure work at our ambulatory surgery centers, was negatively impacted, while our risk-based care delivery business performance reflected lower demand for care. Our OptumInsight and OptumRx volume-based businesses were negatively impacted by the lower level of care encounters which took place, as well as by broader economic factors, contributing to lower managed services and prescription volume. As the health system continues to return to normal seasonally adjusted levels of care, we have seen business activity approach more normal levels. COVID-19 will also continue to influence customer and consumer behavior, both during and after the pandemic, which could impact how care is delivered and the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services. The impact of COVID-19 on our care provider and payer clients could impact the volume and types of services that Optum provides, as well as the pacing of potential new business opportunities. As a result of the dynamic situation and broad-reaching impact to the health system, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our Optum businesses is uncertain. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South American and certain other international health markets. Overall spending on health care is impacted by inflation; utilization; medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement; regulatory requirements; demographic trends in the population; and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions, such as the economic impact of COVID-19, and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any potential impacts from COVID-19 and the Health Insurance Tax. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. Pricing for contracts that cover some portion of calendar year 2021 will reflect the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax. Government programs in the public and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. COVID-19 care and testing costs and certain of our customer assistance initiatives have also impacted medical cost trends in the current year and may continue in future years. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care. The uncertain impact of COVID-19 may impact our ability to estimate medical costs payable, which could result in increased variability to medical cost reserve development in future periods. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of management’s view of regulatory trends and uncertainties. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation,” Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2019 10-K and “ Risk Factors ” in Part II, Item 1A of this report. Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2021 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 1.7%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Affordable Care Act (ACA) Tax. After a moratorium in 2019, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Tax for 2020, which is primarily borne by customers, is $15.5 billion, with our portion being approximately $3.0 billion. The return of the tax impacts year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations. The ACA Tax was permanently repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021. 17 Table of Contents SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS The following summarizes select third quarter 2020 year-over-year operating comparisons to third quarter 2019, which were significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19 on the health system. • Consolidated revenues grew 8%, UnitedHealthcare revenues grew 5% and Optum revenues grew 21%. • UnitedHealthcare served 635,000 fewer people domestically primarily due to increased unemployment and expected attrition in commercial group benefits. • Consolidated earnings from operations decreased 7%, including a decrease of 22% at UnitedHealthcare primarily due to COVID-19 impacts, partially offset by an increase of 9% at Optum. • Diluted earnings per common share decreased to $3.30. • Cash flows from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were $16.1 billion. • Return on equity was 19.7%.

The increases were partially offset by decreased individuals served through our commercial and Global benefits businesses and certain customer assistance programs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, revenues were also negatively impacted by decreases in our fee-for-service care delivery and other volume-based businesses, primarily as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 on the economy. Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased as a result of growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, medical cost trends and COVID-19 care and testing costs, partially offset by decreased people served in commercial and Global and modestly lower care patterns. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the MCR decreased primarily due to the temporary deferral of care and the revenue effects of the return of the Health Insurance Tax, partially offset by COVID-19 care and testing costs and customer assistance measures. Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio increased primarily due to the impact of the return of the Health Insurance Tax and business mix. Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate increased primarily due to the impact of the return of the nondeductible Health Insurance Tax. 19 Table of Contents Reportable Segments See Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by OptumHealth and adjusted scripts for OptumRx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, customer penetration and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment. The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: Three Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 Revenues UnitedHealthcare $ 50,373 $ 48,105 $ 2,268 5 % $ 150,548 $ 145,595 $ 4,953 3 % OptumHealth 10,499 8,133 2,366 29 28,830 21,994 6,836 31 OptumInsight 2,767 2,617 150 6 7,893 7,145 748 10 OptumRx 22,081 18,454 3,627 20 65,009 55,194 9,815 18 Optum eliminations (424) (441) 17 (4) (1,275) (1,181) (94) 8 Optum 34,923 28,763 6,160 21 100,457 83,152 17,305 21 Eliminations (20,181) (16,517) (3,664) 22 (59,331) (47,493) (11,838) 25 Consolidated revenues $ 65,115 $ 60,351 $ 4,764 8 % $ 191,674 $ 181,254 $ 10,420 6 % Earnings from operations UnitedHealthcare $ 2,068 $ 2,655 $ (587) (22) % $ 11,963 $ 8,251 $ 3,712 45 % OptumHealth 835 748 87 12 2,388 2,062 326 16 OptumInsight 785 632 153 24 1,882 1,589 293 18 OptumRx 963 979 (16) (2) 2,655 2,688 (33) (1) Optum 2,583 2,359 224 9 6,925 6,339 586 9 Consolidated earnings from operations $ 4,651 $ 5,014 $ (363) (7) % $ 18,888 $ 14,590 $ 4,298 29 % Operating margin UnitedHealthcare 4.1 % 5.5 % (1.4) % 7.9 % 5.7 % 2.2 % OptumHealth 8.0 9.2 (1.2) 8.3 9.4 (1.1) OptumInsight 28.4 24.1 4.3 23.8 22.2 1.6 OptumRx 4.4 5.3 (0.9) 4.1 4.9 (0.8) Optum 7.4 8.2 (0.8) 6.9 7.6 (0.7) Consolidated operating margin 7.1 % 8.3 % (1.2) % 9.9 % 8.0 % 1.9 % UnitedHealthcare The following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: Three Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual $ 14,081 $ 14,291 $ (210) (1) % $ 41,324 $ 42,407 $ (1,083) (3) % UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement 22,606 20,698 1,908 9 68,613 62,649 5,964 10 UnitedHealthcare Community & State 11,820 10,670 1,150 11 34,796 33,038 1,758 5 UnitedHealthcare Global 1,866 2,446 (580) (24) 5,815 7,501 (1,686) (22) Total UnitedHealthcare revenues $ 50,373 $ 48,105 $ 2,268 5 % $ 150,548 $ 145,595 $ 4,953 3 % 20 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: September 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in thousands, except percentages) 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 Commercial: Risk-based 7,950 8,605 (655) (8) % Fee-based 18,400 19,230 (830) (4) Total commercial 26,350 27,835 (1,485) (5) Medicare Advantage 5,670 5,230 440 8 Medicaid 6,435 5,965 470 8 Medicare Supplement (Standardized) 4,450 4,510 (60) (1) Total public and senior 16,555 15,705 850 5 Total UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical 42,905 43,540 (635) (1) Global 5,285 5,845 (560) (10) Total UnitedHealthcare - medical 48,190 49,385 (1,195) (2) % Supplemental Data: Medicare Part D stand-alone 4,075 4,415 (340) (8) % Fee-based and risk-based commercial business decreased primarily due to increased unemployment and expected attrition. Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states easing redetermination requirements due to COVID-19 and growth in people served via Dual Special Needs Plans. The decrease in people served by UnitedHealthcare Global is a result of our continued affordability efforts, underwriting discipline and increased unemployment. UnitedHealthcare’s revenue increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs and the return of the Health Insurance Tax, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through the commercial and Global businesses and foreign currency impacts. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, earnings from operations decreased due to direct COVID-19 care and testing costs, our customer assistance measures as well as broader economic effects, partially offset by modestly lower care patterns. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, earnings from operations increased due to the deferral of care caused by COVID-19 on the health system and the factors impacting revenue, partially offset by the return of the Health Insurance Tax, COVID-19 care and testing costs, customer assistance programs and broader economic effects. Optum Total revenues increased as each segment reported revenue growth. Earnings from operations increased due to growth at OptumHealth and OptumInsight. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue and earnings at OptumHealth increased primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in risk-based care delivery. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, reduced care volumes in fee-for-service arrangements as a result of COVID-19, partially offset the increases in revenues and earnings. OptumHealth served approximately 98 million people as of September 30, 2020 compared to 95 million people as of September 30, 2019. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in technology and managed services, partially offset by decreased activity levels in volume-based services due to the impact of COVID-19 on payer and care provider clients. 21 Table of Contents OptumRx Revenue at OptumRx and the corresponding eliminations increased due to the inclusion of retail pharmacy co-payments. See Note 1 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further detail. Revenue at OptumRx also increased due to organic and acquisition growth in specialty pharmacy and new client wins, partially offset by an expected large client transition and lower script volumes driven by COVID-19 related care deferral, primarily related to first fill script volumes. Earnings from operations decreased primarily due to COVID-19 impacts, partially offset by improved supply chain management. OptumRx fulfilled 325 million adjusted scripts in both the third quarters of 2020 and 2019, with growth offset by the large client transition. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 16,073 $ 12,258 $ 3,815 Issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net of repayments 2,941 8,192 (5,251) Proceeds from common stock issuances 1,206 740 466 Customer funds administered 249 420 (171) Other — 338 (338) Total sources of cash 20,469 21,948 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (2,541) (5,101) 2,560 Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (4,326) (8,200) 3,874 Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (1,386) (2,028) 642 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (1,477) (1,421) (56) Cash dividends paid (3,400) (2,908) (492) Other (614) (756) 142 Total uses of cash (13,744) (20,414) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (160) (37) (123) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 6,565 $ 1,497 $ 5,068 2020 Cash Flows Compared to 2019 Cash Flows Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by increased net earnings as a result of the temporary deferral of care experienced at our benefits businesses related to COVID-19, partially offset by the payment of the Health Insurance Tax in the third quarter. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included decreased cash paid for acquisitions, common stock repurchases and net purchases of investments, partially offset by decreased issuances of long-term debt. Financial Condition As of September 30, 2020, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $58.0 billion included approximately $17.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $2.9 billion was available for general corporate use), $38.3 billion of debt securities and $2.1 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.6 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of September 30, 2020. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. 22 Table of Contents Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of September 30, 2020, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 38%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of September 30, 2020 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Stable A+ Stable A Stable A- Positive Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1 n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions, including the impacts of COVID-19 and related governmental market stabilization programs. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we repurchased 9 million shares at an average price of $281.37 per share. As of September 30, 2020, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 63 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In June 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.00 compared to $4.32 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this report. For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2019 10-K. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS A summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019 was disclosed in our 2019 10-K. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 1 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. 23 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2019 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2019 10-K. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities law. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; cyber-attacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; risks and uncertainties associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; our ability to contract on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of strategic transactions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; downgrades in our credit ratings; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of September 30, 2020 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): September 30, 2020 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum (a) Interest Expense Per Annum (a) Fair Value of Financial Assets (b) Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 412 $ 176 $ (2,847) $ (8,464) 1 206 88 (1,412) (4,609) (1) (62) (13) 636 4,792 (2) (62) (13) 675 6,424 (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2020, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense, as the rates are assumed not to fall below zero. (b) As of September 30, 2020, some of our investments had interest rates below 1% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2020. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2020. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS A description of our legal proceedings is included in and incorporated by reference to Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 2019 10-K and Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2020 (“2020 First Quarter 10-Q”), which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2019 10-K and 2020 First Quarter 10-Q, are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no other material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in our 2019 10-K and 2020 First Quarter 10-Q. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the third quarter 2020, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares at an average price of $303.76 per share.

Statements 6 Table of Contents UnitedHealth Group Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and “the Company”) is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 as filed with the SEC (2019 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. Use of Estimates These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenue from Products For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, the Company recognized revenue and cost of products sold for retail pharmacy co-payments related to its OptumRx business. Revenue recognized in prior periods related to retail pharmacy transactions excludes the member’s applicable co-payment. There was no impact on earnings from operations, net earnings, earnings per share or total equity. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)” (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 requires the use of the current expected credit loss impairment model to develop an estimate of expected credit losses for certain financial assets. ASU 2016-13 also requires expected credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be recognized through an allowance for credit losses and revises certain disclosure requirements. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 using a cumulative effect upon adoption approach. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 was immaterial to the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, results of operations, equity and cash flows. Under the current expected credit loss impairment model, the Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security’s amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings. The Company has determined that there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 7 Table of Contents 2.

The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities at June 30, 2020 was not material. 8 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of June 30, 2020, by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 3,414 $ 3,433 $ 429 $ 429 Due after one year through five years 10,974 11,365 255 261 Due after five years through ten years 8,481 9,083 31 33 Due after ten years 3,729 3,882 22 24 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,005 6,279 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,875 1,944 — — Total debt securities $ 34,478 $ 35,986 $ 737 $ 747 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses June 30, 2020 Debt securities - available-for-sale: State and municipal obligations $ 284 $ ( 3 ) $ — $ — $ 284 $ ( 3 ) Corporate obligations 1,908 ( 58 ) 375 ( 10 ) 2,283 ( 68 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 249 ( 12 ) 42 ( 2 ) 291 ( 14 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 2,441 $ ( 73 ) $ 417 $ ( 12 ) $ 2,858 $ ( 85 ) December 31, 2019 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 616 $ ( 4 ) $ — $ — $ 616 $ ( 4 ) State and municipal obligations 440 ( 5 ) — — 440 ( 5 ) Corporate obligations 1,903 ( 7 ) 740 ( 4 ) 2,643 ( 11 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 657 ( 3 ) 333 ( 3 ) 990 ( 6 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 406 ( 3 ) — — 406 ( 3 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 4,022 $ ( 22 ) $ 1,073 $ ( 7 ) $ 5,095 $ ( 29 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of June 30, 2020 were generated from approximately 3,000 positions out of a total of 31,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities that impacted our assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, and the potential economic impacts of COVID-19 on the issuers, noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of June 30, 2020, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at June 30, 2020 was not material. 9 Table of Contents 3. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2019 10-K. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value June 30, 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 22,215 $ 112 $ — $ 22,327 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,419 161 — 3,580 State and municipal obligations — 6,199 — 6,199 Corporate obligations 63 17,654 267 17,984 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 6,279 — 6,279 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 1,944 — 1,944 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,482 32,237 267 35,986 Equity securities 1,530 23 — 1,553 Assets under management 1,441 1,932 44 3,417 Total assets at fair value $ 28,668 $ 34,304 $ 311 $ 63,283 Percentage of total assets at fair value 45 % 54 % 1 % 100 % December 31, 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 10,837 $ 148 $ — $ 10,985 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,369 184 — 3,553 State and municipal obligations — 5,926 — 5,926 Corporate obligations 70 17,923 249 18,242 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 6,528 — 6,528 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 1,845 — 1,845 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,439 32,406 249 36,094 Equity securities 1,734 22 — 1,756 Assets under management 1,123 1,918 35 3,076 Total assets at fair value $ 17,133 $ 34,494 $ 284 $ 51,911 Percentage of total assets at fair value 33 % 66 % 1 % 100 % There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the six months ended June 30, 2020 or 2019. 10 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value June 30, 2020 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 566 $ 96 $ 85 $ 747 $ 737 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 53,119 $ — $ 53,119 $ 45,284 December 31, 2019 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 541 $ 181 $ 253 $ 975 $ 972 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 45,078 $ — $ 45,078 $ 40,278 Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during either the six months ended June 30, 2020 or 2019. 4. Medical Costs Payable The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the six months ended June 30: (in millions) 2020 2019 Medical costs payable, beginning of period $ 21,690 $ 19,891 Acquisitions 41 522 Reported medical costs: Current year 76,338 78,523 Prior years ( 660 ) ( 400 ) Total reported medical costs 75,678 78,123 Medical payments: Payments for current year ( 59,482 ) ( 60,707 ) Payments for prior years ( 18,727 ) ( 16,922 ) Total medical payments ( 78,209 ) ( 77,629 ) Medical costs payable, end of period $ 19,200 $ 20,907 For the six months ended June 30, 2020, prior years medical cost reserve development was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the prior years medical cost reserve development included no individual factors that were significant. Medical costs payable included reserves for claims incurred by insured customers but not yet reported to the Company of $ 13.7 billion and $ 13.8 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 11 Table of Contents 5.

Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers. As of June 30, 2020, the Company’s outstanding commercial paper had a weighted average annual interest rate of 0.3 %. The Company has $ 4.4 billion five-year, $ 4.4 billion three-year and $ 3.8 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 25 banks, which mature in December 2024, December 2022 and December 2020, respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2020, no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Company’s senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of June 30, 2020, annual interest rates would have ranged from 0.8 % to 1.1 %. Debt Covenants The Company’s bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring the Company to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of June 30, 2020. 6. Dividends In June 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.00 compared to $4.32 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2019. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The following table provides details of the Company’s 2020 dividend payments: Payment Date Amount per Share Total Amount Paid (in millions) March 24 $ 1.08 $ 1,024 June 30 $ 1.25 1,188 7. Commitments and Contingencies Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. 13 Table of Contents governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status. 8.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and with our 2019 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in that report. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the terms “UnitedHealth Group,” “we,” “our” or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 2, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2019 10-K and in the discussion below. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in data and health information, advanced technology, and clinical expertise, focused on improving health outcomes, lowering health care costs and creating a better experience for patients, their caregivers and physicians. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2019 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. COVID-19 Trends and Uncertainties The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain and difficult to predict. During the quarter, the global health system experienced unprecedented levels of care deferral, which meaningfully impacted all of our businesses. As the pandemic advanced, access to and demand for care was most constrained from mid-March through April, began to recover in May and approached more typical levels by the end of the second quarter. The temporary deferral of care may cause care patterns to moderately exceed normal baselines in the second half of this year as utilization of health system capacity continues to increase. Health system capacity may be subject to possible increased volatility due to the pandemic from time to time. Specific trends and uncertainties related to our two business platforms are as follows: UnitedHealthcare . We have expanded benefit coverage in areas such as COVID-19 testing and treatment, telemedicine, and pharmacy benefits; provided customers assistance in the form of co-pay waivers and premium forgiveness; offered additional enrollment opportunities to those who previously declined employer-sponsored offerings; extended certain premium payment terms for customers experiencing financial hardship; simplified administrative practices; and accelerated payments to care providers, all with the aim of assisting our customers, providers and members in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. Temporary care deferrals significantly impacted UnitedHealthcare’s results of operations for the three-months ended June 30, 2020, contributing to significantly lower medical costs and higher operating earnings than previous periods. The impact of care disruption has been, and will continue to be offset by factors such as COVID-19 related treatment and testing, potential future vaccines and the financial assistance we continue to provide our customers. As health system capacity continues to approach normal levels, consumer demand for care, potentially even higher acuity care, is expected to result in increased future medical costs. Disrupted care patterns, as a result of the pandemic, may temporarily affect the ability to obtain complete member health status information, impacting future revenue in businesses that utilize risk adjustment methodologies. Depending on the future pacing and intensity of the virus, as well as the duration of policies and initiatives to address COVID-19, the ultimate impact is uncertain. 16 Table of Contents Optum. The temporary deferral of care also meaningfully impacted the Optum businesses for the three-months ended June 30, 2020. For example, our fee-for-service care delivery business, such as traditional procedure work at our ambulatory surgery centers, was negatively impacted, while our risk-based care delivery business performance reflected lower demand for care. Our OptumInsight and OptumRx volume-based businesses were negatively impacted by the lower level of care encounters which took place, contributing to lower managed services and prescription volume. As the health system continues to return nearer to normal seasonally adjusted levels of care, we have seen business activity approach more normal levels. COVID-19 will also continue to influence customer and consumer behavior, both during and after the pandemic, which could impact how care is delivered and the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services. The impact of COVID-19 on our care provider and payer clients could impact the volume and types of services that Optum provides, as well as the pacing of potential new business opportunities. As a result of the dynamic situation and broad-reaching impact to the health system, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 is uncertain. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South American and certain other international health markets. Overall spending on health care is impacted by inflation; utilization; medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement; regulatory requirements; demographic trends in the population; and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions, such as the economic impact of COVID-19, and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends . To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any potential impacts from COVID-19 and the Health Insurance Tax. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. Pricing for contracts that cover some portion of calendar year 2021 will reflect the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax. Government programs in the public and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care. The uncertain impact of COVID-19 may impact our ability to estimate medical costs payable, which could result in increased variability to medical cost reserve development in future periods. As a result of higher than expected care deferrals, favorable reserve development of $1.4 billion occurred in the second quarter. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of management’s view of regulatory trends and uncertainties. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation,” Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2019 10-K and “ Risk Factors ” in Part II, Item 1A of this report. Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2021 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 1.7%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Affordable Care Act (ACA) Tax. After a moratorium in 2019, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Tax for 2020, which is primarily borne by customers, is $15.5 billion, with our portion being approximately $3.0 billion. The return of the tax impacts year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations. The ACA Tax was permanently repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021. 17 Table of Contents SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS The following summarizes select second quarter 2020 year-over-year operating comparisons to second quarter 2019, which were significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19 on the health system. • Consolidated revenues grew 3%, UnitedHealthcare revenues grew 1% and Optum revenues grew 17%. • UnitedHealthcare served 425,000 fewer people domestically primarily due to increased unemployment and expected attrition in commercial group benefits and the proactive withdrawal from a Medicaid market. • Consolidated earnings from operations increased, primarily due to temporary care deferrals caused by COVID-19, including increases at UnitedHealthcare and Optum. • Diluted earnings per common share increased to $6.91. • Cash flows from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2020 were $12.9 billion. • Return on equity was 44.0%.

The increases were partially offset by decreased individuals served through our Medicaid, commercial and Global benefits businesses; decreases in our fee-for-service care delivery and other volume-based businesses, primarily as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 on the economy and health system; and certain customer assistance programs. Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs decreased as a result of the temporary deferral of care due to COVID-19 and decreased people served in Medicaid, commercial and Global, partially offset by growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and medical cost trends. The MCR decreased primarily due to the temporary deferral of care and the revenue effects of the return of the Health Insurance Tax. Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio increased primarily due to the impact of the return of the Health Insurance Tax and the Company’s COVID-19 response efforts. Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate increased primarily due to the impact of the return of the nondeductible Health Insurance Tax. 19 Table of Contents Reportable Segments See Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by OptumHealth and adjusted scripts for OptumRx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, customer penetration and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment. The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: Three Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 Revenues UnitedHealthcare $ 49,107 $ 48,594 $ 513 1 % $ 100,175 $ 97,490 $ 2,685 3 % OptumHealth 9,139 7,148 1,991 28 18,331 13,861 4,470 32 OptumInsight 2,632 2,339 293 13 5,126 4,528 598 13 OptumRx 21,371 18,923 2,448 13 42,928 36,740 6,188 17 Optum eliminations (447) (381) (66) 17 (851) (740) (111) 15 Optum 32,695 28,029 4,666 17 65,534 54,389 11,145 20 Eliminations (19,664) (16,028) (3,636) 23 (39,150) (30,976) (8,174) 26 Consolidated revenues $ 62,138 $ 60,595 $ 1,543 3 % $ 126,559 $ 120,903 $ 5,656 5 % Earnings from operations UnitedHealthcare $ 7,007 $ 2,642 $ 4,365 165 % $ 9,895 $ 5,596 $ 4,299 77 % OptumHealth 841 688 153 22 1,553 1,314 239 18 OptumInsight 561 525 36 7 1,097 957 140 15 OptumRx 832 889 (57) (6) 1,692 1,709 (17) (1) Optum 2,234 2,102 132 6 4,342 3,980 362 9 Consolidated earnings from operations $ 9,241 $ 4,744 $ 4,497 95 % $ 14,237 $ 9,576 $ 4,661 49 % Operating margin UnitedHealthcare 14.3 % 5.4 % 8.9 % 9.9 % 5.7 % 4.2 % OptumHealth 9.2 9.6 (0.4) 8.5 9.5 (1.0) OptumInsight 21.3 22.4 (1.1) 21.4 21.1 0.3 OptumRx 3.9 4.7 (0.8) 3.9 4.7 (0.8) Optum 6.8 7.5 (0.7) 6.6 7.3 (0.7) Consolidated operating margin 14.9 % 7.8 % 7.1 % 11.2 % 7.9 % 3.3 % UnitedHealthcare The following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: Three Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual $ 12,963 $ 14,032 $ (1,069) (8) % $ 27,243 $ 28,116 $ (873) (3) % UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement 22,855 20,855 2,000 10 46,007 41,951 4,056 10 UnitedHealthcare Community & State 11,523 11,186 337 3 22,976 22,368 608 3 UnitedHealthcare Global 1,766 2,521 (755) (30) 3,949 5,055 (1,106) (22) Total UnitedHealthcare revenues $ 49,107 $ 48,594 $ 513 1 % $ 100,175 $ 97,490 $ 2,685 3 % 20 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: June 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in thousands, except percentages) 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 Commercial: Risk-based 8,065 8,325 (260) (3) % Fee-based 18,705 19,090 (385) (2) Total commercial 26,770 27,415 (645) (2) Medicare Advantage 5,605 5,190 415 8 Medicaid 6,210 6,360 (150) (2) Medicare Supplement (Standardized) 4,450 4,495 (45) (1) Total public and senior 16,265 16,045 220 1 Total UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical 43,035 43,460 (425) (1) Global 5,365 6,070 (705) (12) Total UnitedHealthcare - medical 48,400 49,530 (1,130) (2) % Supplemental Data: Medicare Part D stand-alone 4,120 4,430 (310) (7) % Fee-based and risk-based commercial business decreased primarily due to increased unemployment and expected attrition. Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual Medicare Advantage plans. The decrease in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by the proactive withdrawal from a market as well as by states managing eligibility, partially offset by increases in Dual Special Needs Plans and states easing redetermination requirements. The decrease in people served by UnitedHealthcare Global is a result of our continued affordability efforts, underwriting discipline and increased unemployment. UnitedHealthcare’s revenue increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage, a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs and the return of the Health Insurance Tax, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through the commercial, Medicaid and Global businesses and foreign currency impacts. Earnings from operations increased due to the deferral of care caused by COVID-19 on the health system and the factors impacting revenue, partially offset by the return of the Health Insurance Tax, COVID-19 treatment and testing costs and customer assistance programs. Optum Total revenues increased as each segment reported revenue growth. Earnings from operations increased due to growth at OptumHealth and OptumInsight, partially offset by decreased earnings from operations at OptumRx. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue and earnings at OptumHealth increased primarily due to acquisitions and organic growth in risk-based care delivery, partially offset by reduced care volumes in fee-for-service arrangements as a result of COVID-19. Earnings from operations also increased at our risk-based business due to the deferral of care caused by COVID-19. OptumHealth served approximately 97 million people as of June 30, 2020 compared to 95 million people as of June 30, 2019. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in managed services, partially offset by decreased activity levels in volume-based services due to the impact of COVID-19 on payer and care provider clients. 21 Table of Contents OptumRx Revenue at OptumRx and the corresponding eliminations increased due to the inclusion of retail pharmacy co-payments. See Note 1 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further detail. Revenue at OptumRx also increased due to organic and acquisition growth in specialty pharmacy and new client wins, partially offset by an expected large client transition and lower script volumes driven by COVID-19 related care deferral, primarily related to first fill script volumes. Earnings from operations decreased primarily due to the impact of lower script volumes, partially offset by improved supply chain management. OptumRx fulfilled 316 million and 343 million adjusted scripts in the second quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease was due to the expected large client transition and lower script volumes due to the impacts of COVID-19, partially offset by organic growth. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 12,946 $ 9,108 $ 3,838 Issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net of repayments 5,215 5,674 (459) Proceeds from common stock issuances 870 448 422 Customer funds administered 1,263 1,435 (172) Sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases 573 — 573 Other — 504 (504) Total sources of cash 20,867 17,169 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (1,691) (4,501) 2,810 Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (3,952) (4,751) 799 Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities — (1,654) 1,654 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (920) (977) 57 Cash dividends paid (2,212) (1,884) (328) Other (607) (529) (78) Total uses of cash (9,382) (14,296) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (143) 6 (149) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 11,342 $ 2,879 $ 8,463 2020 Cash Flows Compared to 2019 Cash Flows Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by increased net earnings as a result of the temporary deferral of care experienced at our benefits businesses related to COVID-19 and the timing of federal income tax payments, which will be paid in the third quarter. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included decreased common stock repurchases and decreased net purchases of investments. Financial Condition As of June 30, 2020, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $60.3 billion included approximately $22.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $4.2 billion was available for general corporate use), $36.0 billion of debt securities and $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.5 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of June 30, 2020. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. 22 Table of Contents Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of June 30, 2020, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 39%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of June 30, 2020 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Stable A+ Stable A Stable A- Positive Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1 n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions, including the impacts of COVID-19 and related governmental market stabilization programs. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, we repurchased 6 million shares at an average price of $271.32 per share. As of June 30, 2020, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 66 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In June 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.00 compared to $4.32 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Fina ncial Statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this report. For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2019 10-K. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS A summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019 was disclosed in our 2019 10-K. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 1 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. 23 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2019 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2019 10-K. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities law. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; cyber-attacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; risks and uncertainties associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; our ability to contract on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of strategic transactions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; downgrades in our credit ratings; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of June 30, 2020 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): June 30, 2020 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum (a) Interest Expense Per Annum (a) Fair Value of Financial Assets (b) Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 504 $ 200 $ (2,567) $ (8,573) 1 252 100 (1,271) (4,715) (1) (80) (16) 623 4,676 (2) (80) (16) 657 6,214 (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2020, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense, as the rate cannot fall below zero. (b) As of June 30, 2020, some of our investments had interest rates below 1% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2020. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2020. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS A description of our legal proceedings is included in and incorporated by reference to Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 2019 10-K and Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2020 (“2020 First Quarter 10-Q”), which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2019 10-K and 2020 First Quarter 10-Q, are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no other material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in our 2019 10-K and 2020 First Quarter 10-Q. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the second quarter 2020, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. As of June 30, 2020, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 66 million shares of our common stock. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 6.

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 5 Table of Contents UnitedHealth Group Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and “the Company”) is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 as filed with the SEC ( 2019 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. Use of Estimates These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Revenue from Products For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company recognized revenue and cost of products sold for retail pharmacy co-payments related to its OptumRx business. Revenue recognized in prior periods related to retail pharmacy transactions excludes the member’s applicable co-payment. There was no impact on earnings from operations, net earnings, earnings per share or total equity. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)” (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 requires the use of the current expected credit loss impairment model to develop an estimate of expected credit losses for certain financial assets. ASU 2016-13 also requires expected credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be recognized through an allowance for credit losses and revises certain disclosure requirements. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 using a cumulative effect upon adoption approach. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 was immaterial to the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, results of operations, equity and cash flows. Under the current expected credit loss impairment model, the Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security’s amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings. The Company has determined that there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 6 Table of Contents 2.

The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments and shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.4 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities at March 31, 2020 was not material. 7 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of March 31, 2020 , by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 3,010 $ 3,011 $ 319 $ 320 Due after one year through five years 11,565 11,604 352 359 Due after five years through ten years 8,563 8,669 28 28 Due after ten years 3,655 3,656 26 28 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,508 6,768 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,932 1,924 — — Total debt securities $ 35,233 $ 35,632 $ 725 $ 735 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses March 31, 2020 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 56 $ ( 1 ) $ — $ — $ 56 $ ( 1 ) State and municipal obligations 810 ( 20 ) — — 810 ( 20 ) Corporate obligations 9,294 ( 382 ) 391 ( 29 ) 9,685 ( 411 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 841 ( 33 ) 30 ( 3 ) 871 ( 36 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 11,001 $ ( 436 ) $ 421 $ ( 32 ) $ 11,422 $ ( 468 ) December 31, 2019 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 616 $ ( 4 ) $ — $ — $ 616 $ ( 4 ) State and municipal obligations 440 ( 5 ) — — 440 ( 5 ) Corporate obligations 1,903 ( 7 ) 740 ( 4 ) 2,643 ( 11 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 657 ( 3 ) 333 ( 3 ) 990 ( 6 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 406 ( 3 ) — — 406 ( 3 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 4,022 $ ( 22 ) $ 1,073 $ ( 7 ) $ 5,095 $ ( 29 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of March 31, 2020 were generated from approximately 10,000 positions out of a total of 32,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities that impacted our assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, and the potential economic impacts of COVID-19 on the issuers, noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of March 31, 2020 , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at March 31, 2020 was not material. 8 Table of Contents 3. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2019 10-K. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value March 31, 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 21,450 $ 119 $ — $ 21,569 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,143 185 — 3,328 State and municipal obligations — 5,918 — 5,918 Corporate obligations 59 17,385 250 17,694 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 6,768 — 6,768 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 1,924 — 1,924 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,202 32,180 250 35,632 Equity securities 1,394 19 — 1,413 Assets under management 937 1,890 39 2,866 Total assets at fair value $ 26,983 $ 34,208 $ 289 $ 61,480 Percentage of total assets at fair value 44 % 56 % — % 100 % December 31, 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 10,837 $ 148 $ — $ 10,985 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,369 184 — 3,553 State and municipal obligations — 5,926 — 5,926 Corporate obligations 70 17,923 249 18,242 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 6,528 — 6,528 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 1,845 — 1,845 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,439 32,406 249 36,094 Equity securities 1,734 22 — 1,756 Assets under management 1,123 1,918 35 3,076 Total assets at fair value $ 17,133 $ 34,494 $ 284 $ 51,911 Percentage of total assets at fair value 33 % 66 % 1 % 100 % There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2020 or 2019 . 9 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value March 31, 2020 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 556 $ 91 $ 88 $ 735 $ 725 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 45,272 $ — $ 45,272 $ 40,394 December 31, 2019 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 541 $ 181 $ 253 $ 975 $ 972 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 45,078 $ — $ 45,078 $ 40,278 Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. There were no significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during either the three months ended March 31, 2020 or 2019 . 4. Medical Costs Payable The following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the three months ended March 31: (in millions) 2020 2019 Medical costs payable, beginning of period $ 21,690 $ 19,891 Acquisitions — 35 Reported medical costs: Current year 41,580 39,239 Prior years ( 580 ) ( 300 ) Total reported medical costs 41,000 38,939 Medical payments: Payments for current year ( 23,471 ) ( 22,973 ) Payments for prior years ( 16,447 ) ( 14,753 ) Total medical payments ( 39,918 ) ( 37,726 ) Medical costs payable, end of period $ 22,772 $ 21,139 For the three months ended March 31, 2020 , prior years medical cost reserve development was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 , the prior years medical cost reserve development included no individual factors that were significant. Medical costs payable included reserves for claims incurred by insured customers but not yet reported to the Company of $ 14.3 billion and $ 13.8 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 10 Table of Contents 5.

Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers. As of March 31, 2020 , the Company’s outstanding commercial paper had a weighted average annual interest rate of 2.4 % . The Company has $ 4.4 billion five-year, $ 4.4 billion three-year and $ 3.8 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 25 banks, which mature in December 2024 , December 2022 and December 2020 , respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Company’s senior unsecured credit ratings. As of March 31, 2020 , the Company had drawn $ 1.8 billion , $ 4.4 billion and $ 3.8 billion at annual interest rates of 1.6 % , 1.6 % and 1.7 % on its $4.4 billion five-year, $4.4 billion three-year and $3.8 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities, respectively. Debt Covenants The Company’s bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring the Company to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60% . The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of March 31, 2020 . 6. Commitments and Contingencies Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the 12 Table of Contents Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status. 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and with our 2019 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in that report. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the terms “UnitedHealth Group,” “we,” “our” or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 2, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2019 10-K and in the discussion below. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in data and health information, advanced technology, and clinical expertise, focused on improving health outcomes, lowering health care costs and creating a better experience for patients, their caregivers and physicians. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2019 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. COVID-19 Trends and Uncertainties The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving and the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is uncertain and difficult to predict. For additional information regarding risks and uncertainties relating to COVID-19, see “ Risk Factors ” in Part II, Item 1A of this report . Specific trends and uncertainties related to our two business platforms are as follows: UnitedHealthcare. W e have expanded benefit coverage in areas such as COVID-19 testing and treatment, telemedicine, and pharmacy benefits; offered additional enrollment opportunities to those who previously declined employer-sponsored offerings; extended certain premium payment terms for customers experiencing financial hardship; simplified administrative practices; and began accelerating payments to care providers, all with the aim of assisting our customers, providers and members in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. Potential economic costs, including cost of care and loss of commercial membership due to higher rates of unemployment, may initially be more than offset by temporary deferrals of elective care and increased membership in Medicaid and individual programs. Following the crisis, consumer demand for care is expected to return, resulting in potentially increased future medical costs. Depending on the pacing and intensity of the virus, as well as the duration of policies and initiatives to address COVID-19, such as stay-at-home and social distancing guidelines, the ultimate impact is uncertain. Optum. The reduction of elective and routine procedures also impacts the Optum business. For example, most traditional procedure work at our ambulatory surgery centers has been postponed, while our capitated care delivery businesses have experienced lower care demand. COVID-19 will also continue to influence customer and consumer behavior, both during and after the pandemic, which could impact how care is delivered and the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services. The impact of COVID-19 on our care provider and payer clients could impact the volume and types of services that Optum provides, as well as the pacing of potential new business opportunities. As a result of the dynamic situation and broad-reaching impact to the health system, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 is uncertain. 14 Table of Contents Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South American and certain other international health markets. Overall spending on health care is impacted by inflation; utilization; medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement; regulatory requirements; demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions, such as the economic impact of COVID-19, and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. Pricing Trends . To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any impact from the Health Insurance Tax. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. Pricing for contracts that cover some portion of calendar year 2021 will reflect the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax. Government programs in the public and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care. The uncertain impact of COVID-19 may impact our ability to estimate medical costs payable, which could result in increased variability to medical cost reserve development in future periods. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of management’s view of regulatory trends and uncertainties. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation,” Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2019 10-K and “ Risk Factors ” in Part II, Item 1A of this report. Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2021 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 1.7%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Affordable Care Act (ACA) Tax. After a moratorium in 2019, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Tax for 2020, which is primarily borne by customers, is $15.5 billion, with our portion being approximately $3.0 billion. The return of the tax impacts year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations. The ACA Tax was permanently repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021. SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS The following summarizes select first quarter 2020 year-over-year operating comparisons to first quarter 2019 . • Consolidated revenues grew 7% , UnitedHealthcare revenues grew 4% and Optum revenues grew 25% . • UnitedHealthcare served 670,000 fewer people domestically primarily due to expected attrition in commercial group and the proactive withdrawal from a Medicaid market. • Consolidated earnings from operations increased 3% , including a decrease of 2% at UnitedHealthcare and an increase of 12% at Optum. • Diluted earnings per common share decreased 1% to $3.52 . • Cash flows from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were $2.9 billion . • Return on equity was 23.6% . 15 Table of Contents RESULTS SUMMARY The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information: (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 Revenues: Premiums $ 50,640 $ 47,513 $ 3,127 7 % Products 8,431 8,072 359 4 Services 4,985 4,318 667 15 Investment and other income 365 405 (40 ) (10 ) Total revenues 64,421 60,308 4,113 7 Operating costs: Medical costs 41,000 38,939 2,061 5 Operating costs 10,015 8,517 1,498 18 Cost of products sold 7,687 7,381 306 4 Depreciation and amortization 723 639 84 13 Total operating costs 59,425 55,476 3,949 7 Earnings from operations 4,996 4,832 164 3 Interest expense (437 ) (400 ) (37 ) 9 Earnings before income taxes 4,559 4,432 127 3 Provision for income taxes (1,094 ) (875 ) (219 ) 25 Net earnings 3,465 3,557 (92 ) (3 ) Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (83 ) (90 ) 7 (8 ) Net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 3,382 $ 3,467 $ (85 ) (2 )% Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 3.52 $ 3.56 $ (0.04 ) (1 )% Medical care ratio (a) 81.0 % 82.0 % (1.0 )% Operating cost ratio 15.5 14.1 1.4 Operating margin 7.8 8.0 (0.2 ) Tax rate 24.0 19.7 4.3 Net earnings margin (b) 5.2 5.7 (0.5 ) Return on equity (c) 23.6 % 26.8 % (3.2 )% (a) Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.

Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased due to growth in people served through Medicare Advantage, medical cost trends and calendar day impacts, partially offset by decreased people served in Medicaid due to a proactive market withdrawal and increased prior year favorable medical cost development. The MCR decreased primarily due to the revenue effects of the return of the Health Insurance Tax, partially offset by calendar day impacts. Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio increased primarily due to the impact of the return of the Health Insurance Tax and changes in business mix, partially offset by effective operating cost management. 16 Table of Contents Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate increased primarily due to the impact of the return of the nondeductible Health Insurance Tax. Reportable Segments See Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by OptumHealth and adjusted scripts for OptumRx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, customer penetration and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment. The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 Revenues UnitedHealthcare $ 51,068 $ 48,896 $ 2,172 4 % OptumHealth 9,192 6,713 2,479 37 OptumInsight 2,494 2,189 305 14 OptumRx 21,557 17,817 3,740 21 Optum eliminations (404 ) (359 ) (45 ) 13 Optum 32,839 26,360 6,479 25 Eliminations (19,486 ) (14,948 ) (4,538 ) 30 Consolidated revenues $ 64,421 $ 60,308 $ 4,113 7 % Earnings from operations UnitedHealthcare $ 2,888 $ 2,954 $ (66 ) (2 )% OptumHealth 712 626 86 14 OptumInsight 536 432 104 24 OptumRx 860 820 40 5 Optum 2,108 1,878 230 12 Consolidated earnings from operations $ 4,996 $ 4,832 $ 164 3 % Operating margin UnitedHealthcare 5.7 % 6.0 % (0.3 )% OptumHealth 7.7 9.3 (1.6 ) OptumInsight 21.5 19.7 1.8 OptumRx 4.0 4.6 (0.6 ) Optum 6.4 7.1 (0.7 ) Consolidated operating margin 7.8 % 8.0 % (0.2 )% UnitedHealthcare The following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual $ 14,280 $ 14,084 $ 196 1 % UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement 23,152 21,096 2,056 10 UnitedHealthcare Community & State 11,453 11,182 271 2 UnitedHealthcare Global 2,183 2,534 (351 ) (14 ) Total UnitedHealthcare revenues $ 51,068 $ 48,896 $ 2,172 4 % 17 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in thousands, except percentages) 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 Commercial: Risk-based 8,215 8,340 (125 ) (1 )% Fee-based 18,825 19,175 (350 ) (2 ) Total commercial 27,040 27,515 (475 ) (2 ) Medicare Advantage 5,575 5,165 410 8 Medicaid 5,880 6,425 (545 ) (8 ) Medicare Supplement (Standardized) 4,440 4,500 (60 ) (1 ) Total public and senior 15,895 16,090 (195 ) (1 ) Total UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical 42,935 43,605 (670 ) (2 ) International 5,605 6,125 (520 ) (8 ) Total UnitedHealthcare - medical 48,540 49,730 (1,190 ) (2 )% Supplemental Data: Medicare Part D stand-alone 4,150 4,480 (330 ) (7 )% Fee-based and risk-based commercial business decreased primarily due to expected attrition. Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual Medicare Advantage plans. The decrease in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by the proactive withdrawal from a market as well as by states managing eligibility, partially offset by increases in Dual Special Needs Plans. The decrease in people served internationally is a result of our continued affordability efforts and underwriting discipline. UnitedHealthcare’s revenue increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage, a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs and the return of the Health Insurance Tax, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through the commercial and Medicaid businesses. Earnings from operations decreased primarily due to the return of the Health Insurance Tax and calendar day impacts, partially offset by the factors impacting revenue. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of productivity and overall cost management initiatives in addition to the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth primarily due to acquisitions and organic growth in care delivery. OptumHealth served approximately 96 million people as of March 31, 2020 compared to 93 million people as of March 31, 2019. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in managed services. OptumRx Revenue at OptumRx and the corresponding eliminations increased due to the inclusion of retail pharmacy co-payments. See Note 1 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further detail. Revenue at OptumRx also increased due to organic and acquisition growth in specialty pharmacy and new client wins, partially offset by an expected large client transition. Earnings from operations increased primarily due to improved supply chain management. OptumRx fulfilled 339 million adjusted scripts in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, with organic growth in adjusted scripts being offset by the expected large client transition. 18 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 vs. 2019 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 2,943 $ 3,234 $ (291 ) Issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net of repayments 10,797 1,851 8,946 Proceeds from common stock issuances 557 323 234 Customer funds administered 1,062 1,784 (722 ) Sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases 30 — 30 Total sources of cash 15,389 7,192 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (1,691 ) (3,002 ) 1,311 Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (929 ) (689 ) (240 ) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities — (319 ) 319 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (469 ) (562 ) 93 Cash dividends paid (1,024 ) (860 ) (164 ) Other (563 ) (214 ) (349 ) Total uses of cash (4,676 ) (5,646 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (129 ) (5 ) (124 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 10,584 $ 1,541 $ 9,043 2020 Cash Flows Compared to 2019 Cash Flows Decreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased short-term borrowings and decreased common stock repurchases, partially offset by a decrease in customer funds administered. Financial Condition As of March 31, 2020 , our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $58.9 billion included approximately $21.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $10.9 billion was available for general corporate use), $35.6 billion of debt securities and $1.7 billion of investments in equity securities. Cash available for general corporate use was intentionally higher than previous periods as a prudent response to more volatile financial markets. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.5 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of March 31, 2020 . When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of March 31, 2020 , our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 44%. 19 Table of Contents Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of March 31, 2020 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Stable A+ Stable A Stable A- Positive Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1 n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions, including the impacts of COVID-19 and related governmental market stabilization programs. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , we repurchased 6 million shares at an average price of $271.32 per share. As of March 31, 2020 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to 66 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. Our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders reflects an annual dividend rate of $4.32 per share. For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2019 10-K. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS A summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019 was disclosed in our 2019 10-K. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 1 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2019 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2019 10-K. 20 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities law. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; cyber-attacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; risks and uncertainties associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; our ability to contract on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of strategic transactions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; downgrades in our credit ratings; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of March 31, 2020 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): March 31, 2020 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum (a) Interest Expense Per Annum (a) Fair Value of Financial Assets (b) Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 491 $ 404 $ (2,514 ) $ (6,673 ) 1 246 202 (1,250 ) (3,628 ) (1) (160 ) (202 ) 784 3,735 (2) (160 ) (267 ) 877 4,694 (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2020, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction in interest income or the full 200 basis point reduction in interest expense, as the rate cannot fall below zero. (b) As of March 31, 2020, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2020 . Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2020 . CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS A description of our legal proceedings is included in and incorporated by reference to Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 2019 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2019 10-K and in this Item 1A, are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no other material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2019 10-K except that we have added the following risk factor to provide details on our risks associated with COVID-19: We are subject to risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial performance. The rapidly developing COVID-19 global health crisis is having major impacts on health systems, businesses, governments and customer and consumer activities. UnitedHealth Group continues to mobilize the full strength of its resources to deliver the best care for patients, support for its members and care provider partners, and deliver innovative solutions and support for the communities we serve and the entire health system. The impact to our business is primarily dependent upon the ultimate pacing, intensity and duration of the crisis, factors which we cannot predict at this time. These factors will drive the related treatment, testing, coverage and other services we provide for the people we serve. The health system has recently experienced deferrals of elective care, which impacts both the UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses through decreased utilization of health care services. As the crisis abates, we may experience an increase in medical care costs as people seek care which was deferred during the pandemic and individuals with chronic conditions may require additional care needs resulting from missed treatments. There can be no assurance that the premiums and fees we charge will be sufficient to cover the medical and administrative costs associated with COVID-19. In addition, we may experience reduced demand for certain services Optum provides to care providers and health plans as a result of reduced clinical and claims activity and changes in business priorities resulting from COVID-19. We cannot at this time measure the impact or duration of changing customer, consumer and member behavior to our overall business. Governmental policies and initiatives to address COVID-19 have resulted in our customers having to close or severely curtail their operations. Among other impacts, we may experience loss of commercial membership due to customer reductions in workforce and an adverse impact on the timing and collectability of premium payments. In addition, governments have modified, and may continue to modify, regulatory standards around various aspects of health care in response to COVID-19, 22 Table of Contents and these rapidly changing standards may create challenges for us to ensure timely compliance and meet various contractual obligations. Disruptions in public and private infrastructure, including supply chains providing medical supplies and pharmaceutical products, could adversely disrupt our business operations. Additionally, the enactment of emergency powers by governments could disrupt our business operations, including restricting pharmaceuticals or other supplies, and could increase the risk of shortages of necessary items. We have transitioned a significant number of our team members to at-home work environments in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This transition may increase our operating costs and effectiveness, including our ability to maintain service levels and ratings, and exacerbate certain risks to our business, including demand for information technology resources, increased vulnerabilities to cybersecurity attacks, and increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us, our customers or our members. The COVID-19 crisis has also adversely impacted global access to capital and caused significant volatility in financial markets. Significant deterioration of the U.S. and global economies could have a significant adverse impact on our investment income, the value of our investments, or future liquidity needs. Because of the unknown pacing, intensity and duration of this pandemic, we cannot predict the impact of its ultimate disruption to business activities, its employment and economic effects, its near and long-term impacts on the patterns of care and services across the healthcare system, or the ultimate resulting impact on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the first quarter 2020, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares at an average price of $271.32 per share. As of March 31, 2020, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 66 million shares of our common stock. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 6.

Basis of Presentation UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the SEC ( 2018 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. Use of Estimates These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” as modified by ASUs 2018-01, 2018-10, 2018-11, 2018-20 and 2019-01 (collectively, ASU 2016-02). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity is required to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases on the entity’s balance sheet for both finance and operating leases. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 using a cumulative-effect upon adoption approach as of January 1, 2019. Upon adoption, the Company recognized $ 3.3 billion of lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and liabilities for operating leases on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, of which, $ 668 million were classified as current liabilities. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 was immaterial to the Company’s consolidated results of operations, equity and cash flows. The Company has included the disclosures required by ASU 2016-02 below and in Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies.” The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. At the lease commencement date, lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the lease contract. If an interest rate is not implicit in a lease, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period that closely matches the lease term. The Company’s ROU assets are included in other assets, and lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has determined that there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 7 Table of Contents 2.

The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments, shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds and dividend paying stocks with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.5 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. 8 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of September 30, 2019 , by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 3,571 $ 3,577 $ 313 $ 313 Due after one year through five years 11,904 12,084 258 259 Due after five years through ten years 8,303 8,669 141 141 Due after ten years 3,294 3,419 139 141 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 6,361 6,468 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,685 1,732 — — Total debt securities $ 35,118 $ 35,949 $ 851 $ 854 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses September 30, 2019 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 286 $ ( 1 ) $ 228 $ ( 1 ) $ 514 $ ( 2 ) State and municipal obligations 296 ( 2 ) 83 ( 1 ) 379 ( 3 ) Corporate obligations 1,360 ( 5 ) 1,022 ( 4 ) 2,382 ( 9 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 570 ( 2 ) 518 ( 4 ) 1,088 ( 6 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 217 ( 1 ) — — 217 ( 1 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 2,729 $ ( 11 ) $ 1,851 $ ( 10 ) $ 4,580 $ ( 21 ) December 31, 2018 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 998 $ ( 7 ) $ 1,425 $ ( 35 ) $ 2,423 $ ( 42 ) State and municipal obligations 1,334 ( 11 ) 2,491 ( 46 ) 3,825 ( 57 ) Corporate obligations 8,105 ( 109 ) 4,239 ( 109 ) 12,344 ( 218 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,296 ( 22 ) 2,388 ( 84 ) 3,684 ( 106 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 622 ( 7 ) 459 ( 13 ) 1,081 ( 20 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 12,355 $ ( 156 ) $ 11,002 $ ( 287 ) $ 23,357 $ ( 443 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of September 30, 2019 were generated from 4,000 positions out of a total of 32,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant deterioration since purchase. As of September 30, 2019 , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. 9 Table of Contents 3. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2018 10-K.

Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers. As of September 30, 2019 , the Company’s outstanding commercial paper had a weighted average annual interest rate of 2.2 % . The Company has $ 3.5 billion five-year, $ 3.5 billion three-year and $ 3.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 26 banks, which mature in December 2023 , December 2021 and December 2019 , respectively. The Company additionally has a $ 2.5 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facility with 6 banks that matures in May 2020 . These facilities provide liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2019 , no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Company’s senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of September 30, 2019 , annual interest rates would have ranged from 2.7 % to 2.8 % . Debt Covenants The Company’s bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring the Company to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60% . The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of September 30, 2019 . 6 . Dividends In June 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s annual dividend rate to shareholders to $4.32 compared to $3.60 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2018. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The following table provides details of the Company’s 2019 dividend payments: Payment Date Amount per Share Total Amount Paid (in millions) March 19 $ 0.90 $ 860 June 25 1.08 1,024 September 24 1.08 1,024 7. Commitments and Contingencies Leases Operating lease costs were $ 275 million and $ 760 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , respectively, and included immaterial variable and short-term lease costs. Cash payments made on the Company’s operating lease liabilities were $ 552 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , which were classified within operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of September 30, 2019 , the Company’s weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for its operating leases were 8.6 years and 3.9 % , respectively. 13 Table of Contents As of September 30, 2019 , future minimum annual lease payments under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: (in millions) Future Operating Lease Payments 2019 $ 198 2020 782 2021 693 2022 580 2023 477 Thereafter 1,978 Total future minimum lease payments 4,708 Less imputed interest ( 758 ) Total $ 3,950 Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, the Brazilian national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans (the Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar), state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Brazilian federal revenue service (the Secretaria da Receita Federal), the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status. 14 Table of Contents 8. Business Combinations During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , the Company completed several business combinations for total cash consideration of $ 9.7 billion . The total consideration exceeded the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired by $ 8.6 billion , of which $ 2.0 billion has been allocated to finite-lived intangible assets and $ 6.6 billion to goodwill. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. Acquired tangible assets (liabilities) at acquisition date were: (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,537 Accounts receivable and other current assets 1,775 Property, equipment and other long-term assets 1,941 Medical costs payable ( 868 ) Accounts payable and other current liabilities ( 1,669 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 1,283 ) Total net tangible assets $ 1,433 The preliminary purchase price allocations for the various business combinations are subject to adjustment as valuation analyses, primarily related to intangible assets and contingent and tax liabilities, are finalized. The acquisition date fair values and weighted-average useful lives assigned to acquired finite-lived intangible assets were: (in millions, except years) Fair Value Weighted-Average Useful Life Customer-related $ 1,670 14 Trademarks and technology 117 4 Other 164 10 Total acquired finite-lived intangible assets $ 1,951 13 The results of operations and financial condition of acquired entities have been included in the Company’s consolidated results and the results of the corresponding operating segment as of date of acquisition. Through September 30, 2019 , acquired entities’ impact on revenues and net earnings was not material. Unaudited pro forma revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 as if the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2018 were immaterial for both periods. The pro forma effects of the acquisitions on net earnings were immaterial for both years. 9. Segment Financial Information The Company’s four reportable segments are UnitedHealthcare, OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx . For more information on the Company’s segments see Part I, Item I, “Business” and Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2018 10-K. Total assets at OptumHealth increased to $ 40.1 billion as of September 30, 2019 compared to $ 29.8 billion as of December 31, 2018 , primarily due to goodwill and other intangibles assets from a second quarter 2019 acquisition and the recognition of ROU assets from ASU 2016-02. Total assets at OptumInsight increased to $ 15.1 billion as of September 30, 2019 compared to $ 11.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 , primarily due to goodwill and other intangibles assets from a third quarter 2019 acquisition. 15 Table of Contents The following tables present reportable segment financial information: Optum (in millions) UnitedHealthcare OptumHealth OptumInsight OptumRx Optum Eliminations Optum Corporate and Eliminations Consolidated Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 45,557 $ 1,840 $ — $ — $ — $ 1,840 $ — $ 47,397 Products — 6 29 7,511 — 7,546 — 7,546 Services 2,274 1,487 988 193 — 2,668 — 4,942 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 47,831 3,333 1,017 7,704 — 12,054 — 59,885 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 4,630 1,594 10,734 ( 441 ) 16,517 ( 16,517 ) — Investment and other income 274 170 6 16 — 192 — 466 Total revenues $ 48,105 $ 8,133 $ 2,617 $ 18,454 $ ( 441 ) $ 28,763 $ ( 16,517 ) $ 60,351 Earnings from operations $ 2,655 $ 748 $ 632 $ 979 $ — $ 2,359 $ — $ 5,014 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 449 ) ( 449 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 2,655 $ 748 $ 632 $ 979 $ — $ 2,359 $ ( 449 ) $ 4,565 Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 43,628 $ 985 $ — $ — $ — $ 985 $ — $ 44,613 Products — 13 29 7,302 — 7,344 — 7,344 Services 2,067 1,196 790 164 — 2,150 — 4,217 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 45,695 2,194 819 7,466 — 10,479 — 56,174 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 3,733 1,431 9,960 ( 352 ) 14,772 ( 14,772 ) — Investment and other income 242 125 4 11 — 140 — 382 Total revenues $ 45,937 $ 6,052 $ 2,254 $ 17,437 $ ( 352 ) $ 25,391 $ ( 14,772 ) $ 56,556 Earnings from operations $ 2,559 $ 622 $ 534 $ 875 $ — $ 2,031 $ — $ 4,590 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 353 ) ( 353 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 2,559 $ 622 $ 534 $ 875 $ — $ 2,031 $ ( 353 ) $ 4,237 16 Table of Contents Optum (in millions) UnitedHealthcare OptumHealth OptumInsight OptumRx Optum Eliminations Optum Corporate and Eliminations Consolidated Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 138,088 $ 3,986 $ — $ — $ — $ 3,986 $ — $ 142,074 Products — 23 74 23,874 — 23,971 — 23,971 Services 6,603 4,131 2,532 490 — 7,153 — 13,756 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 144,691 8,140 2,606 24,364 — 35,110 — 179,801 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 13,366 4,522 30,786 ( 1,181 ) 47,493 ( 47,493 ) — Investment and other income 904 488 17 44 — 549 — 1,453 Total revenues $ 145,595 $ 21,994 $ 7,145 $ 55,194 $ ( 1,181 ) $ 83,152 $ ( 47,493 ) $ 181,254 Earnings from operations $ 8,251 $ 2,062 $ 1,589 $ 2,688 $ — $ 6,339 $ — $ 14,590 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 1,267 ) ( 1,267 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 8,251 $ 2,062 $ 1,589 $ 2,688 $ — $ 6,339 $ ( 1,267 ) $ 13,323 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 Revenues - unaffiliated customers: Premiums $ 130,361 $ 2,794 $ — $ — $ — $ 2,794 $ — $ 133,155 Products — 37 72 20,941 — 21,050 — 21,050 Services 6,248 3,587 2,306 449 — 6,342 — 12,590 Total revenues - unaffiliated customers 136,609 6,418 2,378 21,390 — 30,186 — 166,795 Total revenues - affiliated customers — 10,979 4,115 29,062 ( 1,026 ) 43,130 ( 43,130 ) — Investment and other income 633 355 15 32 — 402 — 1,035 Total revenues $ 137,242 $ 17,752 $ 6,508 $ 50,484 $ ( 1,026 ) $ 73,718 $ ( 43,130 ) $ 167,830 Earnings from operations $ 7,316 $ 1,680 $ 1,382 $ 2,469 $ — $ 5,531 $ — $ 12,847 Interest expense — — — — — — ( 1,026 ) ( 1,026 ) Earnings before income taxes $ 7,316 $ 1,680 $ 1,382 $ 2,469 $ — $ 5,531 $ ( 1,026 ) $ 11,821 ITEM 2.

These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, 17 Table of Contents but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2018 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 9 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South American and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product. Overall spending on health care is impacted by inflation; medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement; regulatory requirements; demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being, mitigated by our continued efforts to control health care costs. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations. Pricing Trends . To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any impact from the Health Insurance Industry Tax. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. Pricing for contracts that cover some portion of calendar year 2020 reflects the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax after a moratorium in 2019. Government programs in the public and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of management’s view of regulatory trends and uncertainties. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation,” Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2018 10-K. Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2020 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 2.5%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, including the return of the non-reimbursable Health Insurance Industry Tax, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Health Insurance Industry Tax. There is a one year moratorium on the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2019. This moratorium impacts year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations.

Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased due to growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and medical cost trends, partially offset by increased prior year favorable medical cost development. The MCR increased primarily due to the revenue effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium. Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio decreased due to the impact of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium and effective operating cost management. 19 Table of Contents Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the impact of the moratorium of the nondeductible Health Insurance Industry Tax.

Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. The decrease in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by proactive withdrawal from the Iowa market as well as by states adding new carriers to existing programs and managing eligibility, partially offset by increases in Dual Special Needs Plans. UnitedHealthcare’s revenue and earnings from operations increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Commercial and Medicare Advantage, including a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs. Revenue increases were partially offset by the moratorium on the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2019. Earnings from operations were also favorably impacted by operating cost management. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of productivity and overall cost management initiatives in addition to the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in care delivery, increased care services and organic growth in behavioral health. Increased operating earnings were primarily due to care delivery and care services. OptumHealth served approximately 95 million people as of September 30, 2019 compared to 92 million people as of September 30, 2018. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to organic and acquisition growth in managed services. OptumRx Revenue at OptumRx increased primarily due to acquisitions and organic growth in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by an expected large client transition. Earnings from operations increased primarily due to the factors that increased revenue as well as improved supply chain management. OptumRx fulfilled 325 million and 331 million adjusted scripts in the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease was due to the large client transition. 21 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 12,258 $ 13,317 $ (1,059 ) Issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, net of repayments 8,192 1,200 6,992 Proceeds from common stock issuances 740 745 (5 ) Customer funds administered 420 1,552 (1,132 ) Other 338 — 338 Total sources of cash 21,948 16,814 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (5,101 ) (3,650 ) (1,451 ) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (8,200 ) (5,824 ) (2,376 ) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (2,028 ) (3,729 ) 1,701 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (1,421 ) (1,505 ) 84 Cash dividends paid (2,908 ) (2,454 ) (454 ) Other (756 ) (1,273 ) 517 Total uses of cash (20,414 ) (18,435 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (37 ) (97 ) 60 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,497 $ (1,718 ) $ 3,215 2019 Cash Flows Compared to 2018 Cash Flows Decreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by changes in working capital accounts, partially offset by higher net earnings. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased issuances of commercial paper and decreased net purchases of investments partially offset by increases in cash paid for acquisitions and common stock repurchases. Financial Condition As of September 30, 2019 , our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $50.4 billion included approximately $12.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.5 billion was available for general corporate use), $35.9 billion of debt securities and $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.3 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of September 30, 2019 . When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of September 30, 2019 , our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 41%. 22 Table of Contents Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of September 30, 2019 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Stable A+ Stable A- Stable A- Stable Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1 n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we repurchased 21 million shares at an average price of $245.18 per share. As of September 30, 2019 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to 74 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In June 2019, our Board increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $4.32 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2018 10-K. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS A summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018 was disclosed in our 2018 10-K. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 1 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2018 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2018 10-K. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities law. The words “believe,” 23 Table of Contents “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; cyber-attacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; risks and uncertainties associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; our ability to contract on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of strategic transactions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; downgrades in our credit ratings; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of September 30, 2019 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): September 30, 2019 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 310 $ 268 $ (2,607 ) $ (6,824 ) 1 155 134 (1,293 ) (3,709 ) (1) (155 ) (134 ) 1,227 4,440 (2) (310 ) (268 ) 1,954 9,440 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 24 Table of Contents In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2019 . Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2019 . CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Statements (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the SEC ( 2018 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. Use of Estimates These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” as modified by ASUs 2018-01, 2018-10, 2018-11, 2018-20 and 2019-01 (collectively, ASU 2016-02). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity is required to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases on the entity’s balance sheet for both finance and operating leases. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 using a cumulative-effect upon adoption approach as of January 1, 2019. Upon adoption, the Company recognized $ 3.3 billion of lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and liabilities for operating leases on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, of which, $ 668 million were classified as current liabilities. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 was immaterial to the Company’s consolidated results of operations, equity and cash flows. The Company has included the disclosures required by ASU 2016-02 below and in Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies.” The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. At the lease commencement date, lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the lease contract. If an interest rate is not implicit in a lease, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period that closely matches the lease term. The Company’s ROU assets are included in other assets, and lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has determined that there have been no other recently adopted or issued accounting standards that had, or will have, a material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 7 Table of Contents 2.

The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant deterioration since purchase. As of June 30, 2019 , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. 9 Table of Contents 3. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2018 10-K. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value June 30, 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 13,562 $ 183 $ — $ 13,745 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,474 285 — 3,759 State and municipal obligations — 6,768 — 6,768 Corporate obligations 65 16,583 202 16,850 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 5,730 — 5,730 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 1,631 — 1,631 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,539 30,997 202 34,738 Equity securities 2,035 15 — 2,050 Assets under management 1,011 1,911 21 2,943 Total assets at fair value $ 20,147 $ 33,106 $ 223 $ 53,476 Percentage of total assets at fair value 38 % 62 % — % 100 % December 31, 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 10,757 $ 109 $ — $ 10,866 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,060 345 — 3,405 State and municipal obligations — 7,121 — 7,121 Corporate obligations 39 14,950 173 15,162 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 4,852 — 4,852 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 1,358 — 1,358 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,099 28,626 173 31,898 Equity securities 1,832 13 — 1,845 Assets under management 1,086 1,938 8 3,032 Total assets at fair value $ 16,774 $ 30,686 $ 181 $ 47,641 Percentage of total assets at fair value 35 % 65 % — % 100 % There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the six months ended June 30, 2019 or 2018 . 10 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value June 30, 2019 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 293 $ 177 $ 275 $ 745 $ 741 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 38,927 $ — $ 38,927 $ 35,300 December 31, 2018 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 260 $ 65 $ 295 $ 620 $ 621 Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ — $ 37,944 $ — $ 37,944 $ 36,554 Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment.

Long-term Debt In July 2019, the Company issued $ 5.5 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of the following: (in millions, except percentages) Par Value 2.375% notes due August 2024 $ 750 2.875% notes due August 2029 1,000 3.500% notes due August 2039 1,250 3.700% notes due August 2049 1,250 3.875% notes due August 2059 1,250 Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers. As of June 30, 2019 , the Company’s outstanding commercial paper had a weighted average annual interest rate of 2.6 % . The Company has $ 3.5 billion five-year, $ 3.5 billion three-year and $ 3.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 26 banks, which mature in December 2023 , December 2021 and December 2019 , respectively. The Company additionally has a $ 2.5 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facility with 6 banks that matures in May 2020 . These facilities provide liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2019 , no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Company’s senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of June 30, 2019 , annual interest rates would have ranged from 2.9 % to 3.1 % . Debt Covenants The Company’s bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring the Company to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60% . The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of June 30, 2019 . 6. Dividends In June 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s annual dividend rate to shareholders to $4.32 compared to $3.60 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2018. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The following table provides details of the Company’s 2019 dividend payments: Payment Date Amount per Share Total Amount Paid (in millions) March 19 $ 0.90 $ 860 June 25 1.08 1,024 7. Commitments and Contingencies Leases Operating lease costs were $ 247 million and $ 485 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, and included immaterial variable and short-term lease costs. Cash payments made on the Company’s operating lease liabilities were $ 363 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 , which were classified within operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of June 30, 2019 , the Company’s weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for its operating leases were 8.8 years and 4.0 % , respectively. 13 Table of Contents As of June 30, 2019 , future minimum annual lease payments under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: (in millions) Future Operating Lease Payments 2019 $ 396 2020 760 2021 666 2022 562 2023 463 Thereafter 1,977 Total future minimum lease payments 4,824 Less imputed interest ( 806 ) Total $ 4,018 Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, the Brazilian national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans (the Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar), state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Brazilian federal revenue service (the Secretaria da Receita Federal), the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status. 14 Table of Contents 8. Segment Financial Information The Company’s four reportable segments are UnitedHealthcare, OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx .

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and with our 2018 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in that report. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the terms “UnitedHealth Group,” “we,” “our” or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 2, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2018 10-K and in the discussion below. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, 16 Table of Contents but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2018 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 8 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the United States, South American and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product. Overall spending on health care is impacted by inflation; medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement; regulatory requirements; demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being, mitigated by our continued efforts to control health care costs. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations. Pricing Trends . To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any impact from the Health Insurance Industry Tax. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. Pricing for contracts that cover some portion of calendar year 2020 will reflect the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax after a moratorium in 2019. Government programs in the public and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of management’s view of regulatory trends and uncertainties. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation,” Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2018 10-K. Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2020 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 2.5%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, including the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Health Insurance Industry Tax. There is a one year moratorium on the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2019. This moratorium impacts year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations.

Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased due to growth in people served through Medicare products and medical cost trends, partially offset by increased prior year favorable medical cost development. The MCR increased due to the revenue effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium. Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio decreased due to the impact of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium and effective operating cost management. 18 Table of Contents Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate decreased due to the impact of the moratorium of the nondeductible Health Insurance Industry Tax.

Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. The decrease in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states adding new carriers to existing programs, reduced enrollment from state efforts to manage eligibility status and the sale of our New Mexico Medicaid plan in 2018, partially offset by increases in Dual Special Needs Plans. UnitedHealthcare’s revenue and earnings from operations increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through several Medicare products, a higher revenue membership mix and rate increases for underlying medical cost trends. Revenue increases were partially offset by the moratorium on the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2019. Earnings from operations were also favorably impacted by operating cost management. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of productivity and overall cost management initiatives in addition to the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in care delivery, increased care services and organic growth in behavioral health. Increased operating earnings were primarily due to care delivery and care services. OptumHealth served approximately 95 million people as of June 30, 2019 compared to 92 million people as of June 30, 2018. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to organic growth in managed services. OptumRx Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased primarily due to acquisitions and organic growth in specialty pharmacy, home delivery services and overall prescription growth. OptumRx fulfilled 343 million and 332 million adjusted scripts in the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. 20 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 9,108 $ 12,376 $ (3,268 ) Issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, net of repayments 5,674 2,683 2,991 Proceeds from common stock issuances 448 478 (30 ) Customer funds administered 1,435 3,082 (1,647 ) Other 504 — 504 Total sources of cash 17,169 18,619 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (4,501 ) (3,150 ) (1,351 ) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (4,751 ) (2,636 ) (2,115 ) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (1,654 ) (2,968 ) 1,314 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (977 ) (960 ) (17 ) Cash dividends paid (1,884 ) (1,588 ) (296 ) Other (529 ) (852 ) 323 Total uses of cash (14,296 ) (12,154 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 6 (78 ) 84 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 2,879 $ 6,387 $ (3,508 ) 2019 Cash Flows Compared to 2018 Cash Flows Decreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by the increase in unearned revenues in 2018 due to the June 2018 early receipt of our July CMS premium payment of $5.2 billion and the year-over-year impact of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium, partially offset by higher net earnings and changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased cash paid for acquisitions; common stock repurchases; and issuances of commercial paper and decreased purchases of investments and customer funds administered, due to the early receipt of our CMS payment in 2018 described above. Financial Condition As of June 30, 2019 , our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $50.7 billion included approximately $13.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $900 million was available for general corporate use), $34.7 billion of debt securities and $2.2 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.3 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of June 30, 2019 . When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 21 Table of Contents Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of June 30, 2019 , our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 41%. Long-Term Debt. In July 2019, we issued $5.5 billion in senior unsecured notes. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including refinancing commercial paper borrowings, or redeeming, repurchasing or repaying outstanding securities. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of June 30, 2019 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Stable A+ Stable A- Stable A- Stable Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1 n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. During the six months ended June 30, 2019 , we repurchased 18 million shares at an average price of $246.84 per share. As of June 30, 2019 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to 76 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In June 2019, our Board increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $4.32 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2018 10-K. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS A summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018 was disclosed in our 2018 10-K. During the six months ended June 30, 2019 , there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 1 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2018 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2018 10-K. 22 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. Generally the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements include: our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs, including the impact of any new coverage requirements; new laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application, including increases in medical, administrative, technology or other costs or decreases in enrollment resulting from U.S., South American and other jurisdictions’ regulations affecting the health care industry; the outcome of the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in CMS star ratings and other quality scores that impact revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs, including the effects of a prolonged U.S. government shutdown or debt ceiling constraints; changes in Medicare, including changes in payment methodology, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents; failure to comply with privacy and data security regulations; regulatory and other risks and uncertainties of the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures, which could affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; our ability to execute contracts on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements, including savings resulting from technology enhancement and administrative modernization; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with increased litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other strategic transactions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our reported shareholders’ equity and results of operations; downgrades in our credit ratings; the performance of our investment portfolio; impairment of the value of our goodwill and intangible assets if estimated future results do not adequately support goodwill and intangible assets recorded for our existing businesses or the businesses that we acquire; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or the debt or capital markets to fund our obligations, to maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, to maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle or to continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. We discuss certain of these matters more fully, as well as certain risk factors that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, in our other periodic and current filings with the SEC, including our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Any or all forward-looking statements we make may turn out to be wrong, and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable securities laws. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. 23 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of June 30, 2019 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): June 30, 2019 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 337 $ 305 $ (2,456 ) $ (5,466 ) 1 169 152 (1,233 ) (2,964 ) (1) (169 ) (152 ) 1,177 3,491 (2) (337 ) (305 ) 2,034 7,581 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2019 . Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2019 . CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS A description of our legal proceedings is included in and incorporated by reference to Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 2018 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2018 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2018 10-K. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the second quarter 2019, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares at an average price of $235.77 per share. As of June 30, 2019, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 76 million shares of our common stock. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 6.

Statements 5 Table of Contents UnitedHealth Group Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through its diversified family of businesses, the Company leverages core competencies in data and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the SEC ( 2018 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. Use of Estimates These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” as modified by ASUs 2018-01, 2018-10, 2018-11, 2018-20 and 2019-01 (collectively, ASU 2016-02). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity is required to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases on the entity’s balance sheet for both finance and operating leases. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 using a cumulative-effect upon adoption approach as of January 1, 2019. Upon adoption, the Company recognized $3.3 billion of lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and liabilities for operating leases on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, of which, $668 million were classified as current liabilities. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 was immaterial to the Company’s consolidated results of operations, equity and cash flows. The Company has included the disclosures required by ASU 2016-02 below and in Note 6, “Commitments and Contingencies” . The Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases that are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. At the lease commencement date, lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the lease contract. If an interest rate is not implicit in a lease, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period that closely matches the lease term.

The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments, shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds and dividend paying stocks with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $1.5 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . 7 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of March 31, 2019 , by contractual maturity, were as follows: Available-for-Sale Held-to-Maturity (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 3,457 $ 3,455 $ 132 $ 132 Due after one year through five years 12,283 12,304 318 318 Due after five years through ten years 7,314 7,430 131 131 Due after ten years 2,711 2,765 143 144 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 5,212 5,198 — — Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,471 1,478 — — Total debt securities $ 32,448 $ 32,630 $ 724 $ 725 The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses March 31, 2019 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ — $ — $ 1,329 $ (19 ) $ 1,329 $ (19 ) State and municipal obligations — — 1,274 (9 ) 1,274 (9 ) Corporate obligations 1,461 (7 ) 5,479 (51 ) 6,940 (58 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — — 2,979 (51 ) 2,979 (51 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — — 546 (6 ) 546 (6 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 1,461 $ (7 ) $ 11,607 $ (136 ) $ 13,068 $ (143 ) December 31, 2018 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations $ 998 $ (7 ) $ 1,425 $ (35 ) $ 2,423 $ (42 ) State and municipal obligations 1,334 (11 ) 2,491 (46 ) 3,825 (57 ) Corporate obligations 8,105 (109 ) 4,239 (109 ) 12,344 (218 ) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,296 (22 ) 2,388 (84 ) 3,684 (106 ) Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 622 (7 ) 459 (13 ) 1,081 (20 ) Total debt securities - available-for-sale $ 12,355 $ (156 ) $ 11,002 $ (287 ) $ 23,357 $ (443 ) The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of March 31, 2019 were generated from 11,000 positions out of a total of 30,000 positions. The Company believes that it will collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities for impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant deterioration since purchase. As of March 31, 2019 , the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. 3. Fair Value Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. 8 Table of Contents For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2018 10-K. The following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value March 31, 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 12,283 $ 124 $ — $ 12,407 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,319 302 — 3,621 State and municipal obligations — 6,707 — 6,707 Corporate obligations 17 15,424 185 15,626 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 5,198 — 5,198 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 1,478 — 1,478 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,336 29,109 185 32,630 Equity securities 1,827 12 — 1,839 Assets under management 896 2,043 12 2,951 Total assets at fair value $ 18,342 $ 31,288 $ 197 $ 49,827 Percentage of total assets at fair value 37 % 63 % — % 100 % December 31, 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 10,757 $ 109 $ — $ 10,866 Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,060 345 — 3,405 State and municipal obligations — 7,121 — 7,121 Corporate obligations 39 14,950 173 15,162 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 4,852 — 4,852 Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities — 1,358 — 1,358 Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,099 28,626 173 31,898 Equity securities 1,832 13 — 1,845 Assets under management 1,086 1,938 8 3,032 Total assets at fair value $ 16,774 $ 30,686 $ 181 $ 47,641 Percentage of total assets at fair value 35 % 65 % — % 100 % There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2019 or 2018 .

Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities Commercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers. As of March 31, 2019 , the Company’s outstanding commercial paper had a weighted average annual interest rate of 2.7% . The Company has $3.5 billion five-year, $3.5 billion three-year and $3.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 26 banks, which mature in December 2023 , December 2021 and December 2019 , respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2019 , no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread based on the Company’s senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of March 31, 2019 , annual interest rates would have ranged from 3.2% to 3.4% . Debt Covenants The Company’s bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring the Company to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60% . The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of March 31, 2019 . 6. Commitments and Contingencies Leases Operating lease costs were $238 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and included immaterial variable and short-term lease costs. Cash payments made on the Company’s operating lease liabilities were $181 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which were classified within operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of March 31, 2019, the Company’s weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for its operating leases were 8.5 years and 4.2% , respectively. As of March 31, 2019, future minimum annual lease payments under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: (in millions) Future Operating Lease Payments 2019 480 2020 667 2021 578 2022 481 2023 393 Thereafter 1,553 Total future minimum lease payments 4,152 Less imputed interest (731 ) Total 3,421 Legal Matters Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to 12 Table of Contents estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, the Brazilian national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans (the Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar), state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Brazilian federal revenue service (the Secretaria da Receita Federal), the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. On February 14, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges that the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome that may result from this matter given its procedural status. 7.

In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations. Pricing Trends . To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any impact from the Health Insurance Industry Tax. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. Pricing for contracts that cover some portion of calendar year 2020 will reflect the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax after a moratorium in 2019. Government programs in the public and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care. Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties Following is a summary of management’s view of regulatory trends and uncertainties. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation,” Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2018 10-K. Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2020 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 2.5%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, including the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Health Insurance Industry Tax. There is a one year moratorium on the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2019. This moratorium impacts year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations. SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS The following summarizes select first quarter 2019 year-over-year operating comparisons to first quarter 2018 . • Consolidated revenues grew 9% , UnitedHealthcare revenues grew 8% and Optum revenues grew 12% . • UnitedHealthcare served 880,000 additional people primarily as a result of business combinations and growth in services to self-funded employers and seniors. • Earnings from operations increased 19% , including increases of 23% at UnitedHealthcare and 14% at Optum. • Diluted earnings per common share increased 24% . • Cash flows from operations were $3.2 billion . • Return on Equity was 26.8% . 15 Table of Contents RESULTS SUMMARY The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information: (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 Revenues: Premiums $ 47,513 $ 44,084 $ 3,429 8 % Products 8,072 6,702 1,370 20 Services 4,318 4,104 214 5 Investment and other income 405 298 107 36 Total revenues 60,308 55,188 5,120 9 Operating costs: Medical costs 38,939 35,863 3,076 9 Operating costs 8,517 8,506 11 — Cost of products sold 7,381 6,184 1,197 19 Depreciation and amortization 639 582 57 10 Total operating costs 55,476 51,135 4,341 8 Earnings from operations 4,832 4,053 779 19 Interest expense (400 ) (329 ) (71 ) 22 Earnings before income taxes 4,432 3,724 708 19 Provision for income taxes (875 ) (800 ) (75 ) 9 Net earnings 3,557 2,924 633 22 Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (90 ) (88 ) (2 ) 2 Net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 3,467 $ 2,836 $ 631 22 % Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 3.56 $ 2.87 $ 0.69 24 % Medical care ratio (a) 82.0 % 81.4 % 0.6 % Operating cost ratio 14.1 15.4 (1.3 ) Operating margin 8.0 7.3 0.7 Tax rate 19.7 21.5 (1.8 ) Net earnings margin (b) 5.7 5.1 0.6 Return on equity (c) 26.8 % 23.8 % 3.0 % (a) Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.

Medical Costs and MCR Medical costs increased due to growth in people served through Medicare products and medical cost trends. The MCR increased due to the revenue effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium. Operating Cost Ratio The operating cost ratio decreased due to the impact of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium and effective operating cost management. 16 Table of Contents Income Tax Rate Our effective tax rate decreased due to the impact of the moratorium of the nondeductible Health Insurance Industry Tax. Reportable Segments See Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments.

Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. The decrease in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states adding new carriers to existing programs, reduced enrollment from state efforts to manage eligibility status and the sale of our New Mexico Medicaid plan in 2018. UnitedHealthcare’s revenue and earnings from operations increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through several Medicare products, a higher revenue membership mix and rate increases for underlying medical cost trends. Revenue increases were partially offset by the moratorium on the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2019. Optum Total revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of productivity and overall cost management initiatives in addition to the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows: OptumHealth Revenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic growth and business combinations in care delivery and organic growth in behavioral health. OptumInsight Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to organic growth in managed services. OptumRx Revenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased primarily due to business combinations and organic growth in specialty pharmacy, home delivery services and overall prescription growth. OptumRx fulfilled 339 million and 332 million adjusted scripts in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. 18 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 3,234 $ 8,369 $ (5,135 ) Issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, net of repayments 1,851 3,159 (1,308 ) Proceeds from common stock issuances 323 295 28 Customer funds administered 1,784 2,962 (1,178 ) Total sources of cash 7,192 14,785 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (3,002 ) (2,650 ) (352 ) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (689 ) (2,583 ) 1,894 Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (319 ) (1,385 ) 1,066 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (562 ) (477 ) (85 ) Cash dividends paid (860 ) (722 ) (138 ) Other (214 ) (694 ) 480 Total uses of cash (5,646 ) (8,511 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (5 ) (12 ) 7 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,541 $ 6,262 $ (4,721 ) 2019 Cash Flows Compared to 2018 Cash Flows Decreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by the increase in unearned revenues in 2018 due to the March 2018 early receipt of our April CMS premium payment of $5.1 billion and the year-over-year impact of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium, partially offset by higher net earnings. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, increased sales and maturities of investments, decreased issuances of commercial paper and a decrease in customer funds administered due to the early receipt of our CMS payment in 2018 described above. Financial Condition As of March 31, 2019 , our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $47.0 billion included approximately $12.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $800 million was available for general corporate use), $32.6 billion of debt securities and $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.5 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of March 31, 2019 . When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 19 Table of Contents Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of March 31, 2019 , our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 40%. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of March 31, 2019 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Stable A+ Stable A- Stable A- Stable Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1 n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. Share Repurchase Program. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we repurchased 12 million shares at an average price of $252.76 per share. As of March 31, 2019 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to 83 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. Our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders reflects an annual dividend rate of $ 3.60 per share. For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2018 10-K. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS A summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018 was disclosed in our 2018 10-K. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and acquisitions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 1 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our 2018 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2018 10-K. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the 20 Table of Contents PSLRA. Generally the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements include: our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs, including the impact of any new coverage requirements; new laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application, including increases in medical, administrative, technology or other costs or decreases in enrollment resulting from U.S., South American and other jurisdictions’ regulations affecting the health care industry; the outcome of the DOJ’s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in CMS star ratings and other quality scores that impact revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs, including the effects of a prolonged U.S. government shutdown or debt ceiling constraints; changes in Medicare, including changes in payment methodology, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents; failure to comply with privacy and data security regulations; regulatory and other risks and uncertainties of the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures, which could affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; our ability to execute contracts on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements, including savings resulting from technology enhancement and administrative modernization; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with increased litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other strategic transactions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our reported shareholders’ equity and results of operations; downgrades in our credit ratings; the performance of our investment portfolio; impairment of the value of our goodwill and intangible assets if estimated future results do not adequately support goodwill and intangible assets recorded for our existing businesses or the businesses that we acquire; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or the debt or capital markets to fund our obligations, to maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, to maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle or to continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. We discuss certain of these matters more fully, as well as certain risk factors that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, in our other periodic and current filings with the SEC, including our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Any or all forward-looking statements we make may turn out to be wrong, and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable securities laws. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of March 31, 2019 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): March 31, 2019 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 306 $ 260 $ (2,294 ) $ (5,249 ) 1 153 130 (1,159 ) (2,849 ) (1) (153 ) (130 ) 1,115 3,327 (2) (306 ) (260 ) 2,088 7,327 21 Table of Contents ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2019 . Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2019 . CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS A description of our legal proceedings is included in and incorporated by reference to Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 2018 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2018 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2018 10-K. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board evaluates periodically. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the first quarter 2019, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares at an average price of $252.76 per share. As of March 31, 2019, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 83 million shares of our common stock. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 6.
